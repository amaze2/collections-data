IT may not be generally known that Edward Bellamy, the author of '' Looking Backward,\ was a member of the Union College class of '68. This work has created a decided sensation throughout the cquntry. It has been reviewed and criticised in all the leading newspapers and magazines and has reached the wonderful sale of 150,000 copies. Assum- ing _that every copy of such a book is read · by an a-v-erage of four persons we have his ideas reaching 600,000 of our American· people. Stories in regard to the work and its author are numerous. It has been · stated by some that he never wrote the · book, and an intimate friend of Bellamy asserts that the author claims to have written it as a burlesque upon the idea of paterna] government, and is surprised to find it taken up and treated seriously. But whatever the circumstances under which it was produced, its remarkable sale forces everyone to ask : Why has the work taken so strong a hold upon the people, and what. are the ideas that have produced so much discussion among poli- tical economists~ The work is written in the form of a novel, and the plot of an interesting story alone serves to hold the attention and forces for its explanation a reading of the theories advanced. The author, a victim to insomnia, is nightly put into a mesmeric sleep in a cell deep under his hou~e ; no one but his valet knows this place, and consequently when one night. the house and valet burn up the author sleeps on and is discovered only by accident iu the year 2000. The subject of hypnotism being then thoroughly understood, he is awakened by his dis- coverers; and the rest of the story consists of the clever exposition of matters as he found them-a condition of affairs that is essentially communistic. He pictures a social condition in which all fare alike; in which poverty is done away with; in which there is no crime, because there is no object in it; a state in which every- body is like everybody else ; but a state in which the keen incentives to endeavor, that we are most familiar with, no longer exist. This, then, is the ans\'~er to the question as to the cause of its popularity. The question as to the loss of individual- ism is the one that has been attacked the strongest. This is one of the great ques- tions upon which economists divide, and being raised in all its phases by this work has brought about a strong and healthy '

20 THE CONOORDIENSIS. discussion. In this article no attempt at criticism has been made, we have at- tempted only to put before ouro readers .some idea of the plan of ''Looking Back- ward.\ In our next number we hope to present a review and criticism of the work by a student of these subjects--a 1nan entirely competent-and one whose article, considering the relation of both reviewer and Mr. Bellamy to Union Col- lege, will be of great interest to U 11ion men. * * * THANKSGIVING day Union plays Roches- ter University at Elmira, and to those who know the importance of winning at that place, and the injury that will ensue to the college if we are defeated, the ques- tion as to the condition and . prospects of the team is a pertinent one. Nothing an- swers this question so well as our record thus far in the season. The college has seen the team go to Williams and return with a defeat of 130 to 0. It bas seen Ridgefield'' goose-egg\ us with 60 to their credit. It bas read in the Albany papers a comparison of our playing with that of school boys. It has heard that rumors are afloat in Elmira that our team is dead. We prefer that every man answer his own questions from these data. We do not pretend to criticise, for of course no one but a foot-ball player or manage:r is com- petent to do this. It matters not if we do see men who would never dream of get- ting on the team '' get through \ an.d ef- fectually block the ''varsity \ players ; even if the same team never does play to- gether twice ; even if the team, when it does get out, finds only itself to play against. We do not pretend to say what is the matter. We haven't as profound a knowledge of the game as several of the interested parties. We know that. there are many men in college 9apabl€ of play- ing good foot-ball ; we know that there are four or five men who are doing earnest ·. and magnificent work ; we know that a : man cannot beco1ne a player with one ., day's practice ; but we leave the conclusion : of all this to those capable of drawing it . • If :some good comes from this we will be . content, no matter what other feeling it : may provoke. We are always and forever . · for the glory and good name of Union ·. College. If, on November 9th, we make a ' good showing against Ridgefield in the • return game, none will be more anxious to ·• give credit than this paper. * ~x­ * SINCE the last issue of this paper, U n- . ion's. honor roll has been depleted by the loss of two of her most prominent alumni. In the death of Judge Hooper 0. Van Vorst, '39, Union :College has. lost the .sen- ior member of her board of trustees and an energetic, honored and beloved alum- nus ; the Psi Upsilon fraternity a most loyal and earnest member, and the city of New York a man whose philanthropy and strength of character gained him the af- fection of the entire metropolis. In every station in life his name was known and revered. Ask of the aristocratic Holland Society, of which he was president, ask of the supreme bench of this state, among whom he has sat ; ask of the New York bar ; ask of the newsboys of New York city ; and from one .and all will come the answer of recognition, affection and honor. Again from the high stations in life comes the wail of the bereaved, and Union answers in sympathy. General Hartranft, twice governor of Pennsylva- nia, a man foremost in battle for his country, and against whose political life no word of dishonor has been uttered, is gone. The civic and military demonstra- tions at his funeral served to show his pop- ularity ; the stately monument about to be raised \/\Till commemorate his being; but in the hearts of the union soldiers will General Hartranft live the longest. ,, r~ -'·l ..

Pros- · perous villages and flourishing cities are passed. Now, a quiet river. Ah! there • is the s1nall boy with his fish-pole.

We smile and excuse his boyish vanity; for · we've all been fishing ourselves-. n1any • with poorer luck. 011ward rolls the train.. As we go west- • ward the harvest seems to be further ad- vanced, for here the reapers are at work. As the train thunders by they stop and . gaze after us, wavi,ng their hats until we·. are out of sight. Here is a thrifty looking farm. Look ! a self-binder driven by the . sturdy house~-rife while the farmer follows and gathers the sheaves into stacks. Here· is ente1~prise, indeed ! A.s the thought strikes us, the train dashes into a pleasant looking village and the brakeman shouts \ Enterprise !\ Surely the town has been rightly named. Now the sun is getting low- and, reader, have you ever seen a sunset on the · prairie ? The track stretches out in a ''bee-line\ directly westward as far as the eye can reach, and as the sun sinks lower. and lower it seems at last to rest-a huge . glaring ball of golden fire-directly upon the distant rails. Now bright and most • beautiful colors shoot out and rest upon : the hovering clouds. What a sea of splendor ! Onward we dash, as if to fol- low and keep the enchanting picture ever . with us; but no, a mornent, and it is gone. • Quickly the bright colors fade and a brief twilight comes on, then darkn-ess ; and still marveling at the abrupt change £rom day to night, we roll into the great me- tropolis of the interior and our first day's journey is at an end. . On \Ve go. A good night's rest and we awake to find ourselves upon the well cui- . tivated plains of Minnesota. Here is St. Paul, a great commercial cen-ter and the head of navigation on the Mississippi. Now we cross the great viaduct below St. Anthony's Falls and arrive in Minneapolis, the ''Flour City''- the great mill center from which we get our daily bread. Here the writer tarries a day, for friends are at hand to gileet him. A drive about the city, a stroll through the university, and a run out to one of the most charming of lakes,-the beautiful MinnetQiika,-and he is once more on his way toward the land of the setting sun .. And now., prairie, prairie, prairie ! One vast and seemingly endless extent of level or slightly rolling country. B11.t we have a lively party aboard the train~an over- land train, in fact, is never without unique features-and by singing and listening to the stories of the '' Forty- niners \ or the hair-lifting accounts of cowboy-Indian fights, with an occasional gan1e of whist, the time passes very pleasantly. Our route is over the Canadian Pacific. As we move along large herds of cattle dot the plains and the shrill whistle of our locomotive scatters them from the track. We also observe village after village of prairie dogs, in many places the trails of buffalo, and occasionally an antelope, badger or coyote passes quickly out of the · way of the train. Her majesty's n1ounted police are prom- inent along the line by their .short red coats, rattling spurs, and little gilt undress turban caps, adjusted to the side of their heads, and held in place by a band passing under the chin. And now the 1nountains. We enter them early in the morning. Now the scenery is grand.

Here £or· many a 1nile the wood1nan's axe has never been heard ; and we feel, as in the mountains, that civilization and the arts of modern life would here be .sadly out of place. But, as \Ve near the coast, farms and villages sprin.g up as if by magic, and soon we see in the distance one of the most beautiful bodies of water on the globe-the great inland sea, Puget sound, extending over a hundred miles in length, and dotted with most beautiful islands, a harbor tha-t would float the entire naval . . and n1erchant fleets of the world. Taking boat at Vancouver, B. 0., we touch at Victoria, on Vancouver island, a quaint old town with a decidedly E11glish air, and the following morning arise to find ouTsetves in American waters.

Our huU is not badly injured., and with the aid of the pumps we are able to reach port ; and, reader, after this event you may be- lie-ve we were glad to set foot once more upon :shore: .At last our destination is reached. We are in the metropolis of the new state of Washington -'Seattle, the queen eity of Puget sound. We had expected~ after the great conflagration_ of June 4th--with which we will assume that the reader is fan1.iliar-to see a barren waste, a eity of charred ruins and deserted streets; we find a great workshop, a city which, pllmnix- like, has risen from her ashes more beau- tiful than ever. Thousands of laborers are at work. The strokes of the hammer sound like the rattle of n1usketry. Hun- dreds of building lots are covered with the · foundations of brick and stone blocks, many fast nearing completion. The whole scene reminds one of a hive of bees. Miles of wharves extend along the water front, and vessels to and from all points of the world are loading and discharging their cargoes. The enterprise and push is far beyond anything of which we could have dreamed. ''Truly,\ we say, ''no fire or misfortune can ever crush the spirit of the :people of Seattle.'' The city is beautifully situated upon a gentle rise overlooking the sound on one side and Lake Washington, a magnificent body of fresh water, on the other. Across the sound and beyond a gently 1~olling, wooded country, the snow-capped Olympic. range extends like a lh1e of giant senti- . nels, while to the south-east l\1~. Ranier rises majestically to a height of over four- · teen thousand feet. Time a-nd space will not permit a lengthy description of the Puget sound country, . nor of the return trip, which being over tbe Northern Pacific railroad was far dif- ·· ferent from that through her majesty's p1rovinces, although through a country no less picturesque, and a journey none the less pleasurable .. The writer passed many pleasant weeks upon the coast, and satisfied himself that it is a progressive country, one of great resources, and an excellent place for a col~ lege graduate to begin life's work. He met a great many :college men, prominent a1nong whom ·were several alumni of Union, and .all appeared to be doing well .A .season pleasantly spent passes quickly, and before we are aware the new college year is upon us. It is not without regret · that we leave so charming a country, to turn ho1neward, but as we reach our des- tination we gradually become aware that there is at least one spot upon the earth to which we- are ever ready to return, and we hail with pleasure the advent of another year which brings us under the healthy and congenial influences of life at old Union.

General John Frederick Hartranft., who · died at hishomeinNorristown, Pa., Octo- ber 18th, had· been ~?eriously ill for several •. days, but his death was a surprise and: sudde11 shock both to his family and the ·. community at laTge. Not till late the · previous evening did the attending physi- cian inform t:he family that tbe kidney disease from which the deceased suffered would result in immediate death .. General Hartranft was born in Mont- gomery county, Pennsylvania, December 10, 1830, and was, therefore, not quite fifty-nine years of age. He was gradu- ated from Union College in 1853. He read · law and vvas admitted to the bar in 1859. When the-war came he enter:ed the volun- teer army and, as colonel of .the Fourth · Pennsylvania, was in ,the first battle of · Bull Run. He fought in the battles of Roanoke Island, of N ewberne, the second battle of Bull Run, Antietam, Spotsylva- · nia, and many other engagements. In 1864 he was promoted to be brigadier- general and l~ad coinmand of a brigade at the battle of the Wilderness, after which 11~ was breveted a major-general. His cd1nmand was the first that entered Peters- burg., In 1865 be was elected auditor- general of Pennsylvania and re-elected in 1868. In 1872 he was chosen governor of the state and re-elected for a second term. Upon the expiration of his second term he 1noved to Philadelphia, and in 1879 was appointed postmaster of that city. The · following year be was appointed collector · of the port. F1:om 1879 he was major- general commanding the national guard of Pennsylvania. In the search for a pension commissioner his name bad been most favorably mentioned. In 1880 he was prominent as a candidate for the presidential nomination on t.he Republican ticket. Indeed, it was a ques- tion for a long time whether he or ex- President Ilayes would be the dark horse. He would have carried the soldier vote by storm, and, had he been non1inated, would. undoubtedly have been elected. Weneral Hartranft's death will be sin- cerely mourned. He was a noble man and a highly esteemed citizen. In ev;ery post assigned him he did faithful se1;;~ice..
