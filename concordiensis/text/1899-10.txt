Political Economy has :been called the dismal science, the gospel of selfishness. Man, it is said, is running into a lower plane than formerly; the lofty aims, the high ambitions, the unselfish purposes and the honest regard for the public welfare are giving place to the greed for wealth ·and to a corresponding decadence of character, public and private. Malthus and Ricardo, blighting with their touches of pessimism, the throbbing aspiratioi1s of the idealist, have painted for us a gloomy picture of nature at war with humanity. Indeed, so great does the struggle seem, that in a casual glance at the world at large, society sometimes seems a bewildering mass of possibilities and failures, born of accident and sweeping along the track of time with a dash as irresistable as the falling avalanche and its control ahnost as hopeless and impossible. But the proble1n is by no means a despairing one. One hundred and fifty years ago trade and commerce were strangled by a huge mass of fiscal anomalies known as the mercantile system. Against this, liberalism waged relent- less war under the leadership of Adam Smith. Smith was inspired by the idea of natural liberty in the economic world, of an inherent beneficence and harmony of interests in nature which can only be attained by allowing the great competitive forces freedom to operate, calling upon the State to secure liberty and justice to all. Under these conditions, the industrial world would gradually develop into an harn1onious and organic whole. But he would no more make a fetish of unrestricted individualism than he would fold his arms in hopeless fatalism or call upon the State to endeavor offhand and radically to reconstruct society. But his ideas were in advance of his tilne. During his life they were received because of the power of his own personality. After his death, they became so discredited and so completely lost in the cloud of ''Pessimistic

THE CON·CORDIENSIS. 7 Economy,'·' that it is not till the present time that the world has al\rived at any realization of . their true value. The great industrial transformations of the world for the past century, are bringing about a return to the ideas of Adam Smith. The aspects and real conditions of civilization have been marvelously changed. Great advances have been made in scientific discovery, opening the secret places of nature and revealing her powers. Wherever science has lighted the way, art has followed with her industry. By means of this, the whole sphere of occupations has been raised and amplified ; all enterprise has taken on grander and broader proportions ; wealth has been created and diffused; and corn- forts beyond the dreams of the most sanguine have been made available to all classes of people. The intellectual element has become the prime and dominant factor in wealth production. Something has been found to be tnore necessary than material possibility ; something suggestive, inspiring, cteative ; something superior to nature and master over it; and that something is knowledge and mental force. Everything today bears a more distinctively intellectual type ; everything bears the impress of thought. Each and every one of the occupations of life involves, detnands, is a mental effort putting forth a physical effort. The result is that the increasing demand of today is for workmen of the highest type, men of industry, honesty and intelligence, men of a~ility. This de1nand can only be satisfied and progress industrially can only be brought about by increasing the ability of the worker and by giving that ability free play along the lines of just competition. The Irish were once a proverb over Europe for indolence and shiftlessness. But they were indolent because they were crushed by such insidious legislation as the English \Corn Laws.\ Since 185o, every country on the globe has witnessed the indo1nitable pluck and energy of the Irish at work under equal laws and a fair chance. By undervaluing human ability and just competition, Political Economy will fail as the interpreter and guide of the future world of industry. Ancient civilization fell because it failed to recognize the value of man, the worker. Modern civilization will endure if it will help man the worker to increase with every advance in intelligence and ,morality. Economic forces are today gradually and silently elevating, refining and inspiring our working classes above those of any other nation in the world. Their superiority is due to greater educational advantages and greater freedom to operate along natural lines. They are being led along the path of true progress by the invisible hand of ability and enlightened self- interest. The task before Political Economy is to discourage Trade U nionisn1 vv hich artificially ntakes goods dear and to foster all agencies tending to increase the economic value of man', giving him a higher intelljgence, a purer n1orality and a greater refinement of tastes. Economics insensibly blending with ethics must realize that money-getting should be but a means to an end, that culture and all that goei to widening and deepening of man's personality is the true ideal of humanity. There is no more auspicious sign of the world's progress today than the increasing tendency toward universal peace and arbitration. It is no empty sound which is being wafted from that bell, struck by one of the 1nost powerful n1onarchs of the world, to sound out in the name of Russia-'' Peace and the Brotherhood of the Nations.\ The Utopia of yesterday is in the way of becoming the actuality of tomorrow. The groans of a peasantry ground down by taxa- tion for standing armies will yet be answered. This new departure in human evolution mean·s a passage of society out of a military into an industrial state. Political economy, the least developed of all the sciences, will perhaps be heralded as the science of the twentieth century, the century of commercial and industrial prosperity. Under the new order, patriotism will no longer be a martial sentiment. As the flag looses its former significance as an emblem of outward defiance, it will gain a new tneaning as the supreme symbol of internal concord; it will beco1n·e the visible sign of economic hannony, in which the welfare of all is justly and inpregnably secured.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. As the close of the I 8th century found Europe struggling furiously for the balance of power, so the close of the 19th century finds the com- mercial nations of the world contending for the balance of trade. Each looks with invidious eyes on the prosperity of all about it, considerM ing the gain of one to mean loss to another. The struggle for the balance of power proved as futile as it was sickening. It reached its clin1ax in the meddlesome interference of England in affairs of Russia and Turkey. Russia prevented from expanding in Europe, expanded in Asia where she has almost complete control. The struggle for the balance oi trade will cease with the recognition of that econotnic principle, that that country is going to hold the balance of trade which best supplies the markets of the world as regards cheapness, quantity and quality. Moreover, with the dawn of universal peace, perhaps free trade will become the great eco- nomic law of nations resting not on national independence but on international inter-depen- dence, the progress of one 1naking for the prog- ress of all. England attributes her wealth to the establish- ment of free trade principles. The U. S. as yet maintains a fiscal system in direct and avowed antagonism to those principles. The present conditions see1n to demand such a policy. The great proble1n before us today is that of expansion. The problem is a political one and · it is also an economic one. The U. S. is as yet in her infancy as a colonizing power and the annexation of Hawaii and the Philippines have been viewed, and perhaps justly, from the stand- point of financial expediency. But the demands of civilization upon econon1ics are and ought to be the demands of Christian ethics. Let us hope that the time is not far off when we shall E.O longer be lead by the selfish principle of imtnediate utility, but by the combined economic principle of self-interest and sympathy which, taking root, ultimately blossoms into all that is best and noblest in civilization. Utility is thus refined into morality and selfishness into the highest phase of rnoral conduct. This is the ·· idea which originated with Adam Smith. When this is conceived, there flashes on the mind a vision of the .time when all the nations of the earth shall be bound together by the silken cord enlightened self-interest, a self-interest which of recognizes that, given the conditions of liberty and justice, the gain of one means the gain of all. Nations, instead of lying in wait for each other, armed to the teeth, are seen to be mem- bers of a great confederation, each developing its resources to the utmost and exchanging its products in hannony and with mutual profit. HAROLD J. HINMAN, '99· THE FUTURE OF AMEQICA. Trustee Starin on the Vitality of Ameri- can Heroism. A granite monument, erected at a cost of $6,ooo by Hon. John H. Starin, of New York, above the remains of his uncle,· the late Col. Simeon Satnmons, of the One Hundred and Fifteenth Regiment, New YorkStateVolunteers, was unveiled at Fonda Saturday. Mr. Starin delivered the dedicatory address, closing with the following ringing words of patriotism : \l a1n not one of those who believe in the degeneracy of our time. On the contrary, I hold that the world grows better as it grows older, and I am firm in the belief that as the years go on every trial, every danger which tnay cotne to this beloved land of ours will call to the front new n1en, strong, high-hearted and fresh for the fight. It was so in the war with Spain just closed. It will be so for all time. From my point of view it were as well to try to stop the tides of the sea as to retard or impede the progress of the American Republic, and with this faith strong within me, I dedicate this monument of granite and of bronze to the memory of the heroes who have gone, steadfast in the faith that when my country calls there will be loud and quick response from countless heroes yet to come.\

TH:In C·ONOORDIENSlS. 9 DEWEY DAY ON THE HILL. The Occasion Observed with Appropriate Exercises. Although a large number of students were present at the celebration in New York City . ' the majority remained on the hill to join in the exercises held last Friday morning. The meet- ing was under the direction of W. Dewey Loucks, 1900, and notwithstanding the lateness when it was decided to celebrate, the meeting was spirited and enthusiastic. The various pro- fessors were present, and took an active part in the programtne. In the line of decoration a portrait of the great admiral encircled by a large American flag faced the audience and gave the finishing touches to the patriotic meeting. At ten o'clock chairman Loucks opened the exer- cises with a few prelin1inary remarks. Follow- ing, \The Star Spa.ngled Banner\ was sung with tnuch fervor, after which a prolonged col- lege yell supplemented with \Dewey\ was given. President Raymond was the first speaker, and said that the reception given to the great naval commander was like a revival of old Roman days, when victorious generals returned in triumph. It was inevitable after the battle of Manila to have this celebration, yet instead of bringing back captives in his train, it gave an inspiration to new and larger national life. The battle of Manila was a stroke of boldness calling forth the admiration of the world. It is a fact that few nations have a hero with so many quali- ties combined in his character. As a result of Manila, in one hour, Atnerica took its place as one of the world's foretnost powers, with great responsibilities frotn which it is impossible to turn back. The people cannot think of it, nor would the world approve of it. The lesson teaches a greater outburst of patriotic fervor, that Union must be loyal to the nation by put- ting forth men fitted for larger national demands. The Union Marching Song was then sung with enthusiasm, after which Dr. Wells spoke in a happy vein. ''Young gentlemen,\ sa1d he,'' it is needless for me to say anything about Dewey, for who doesn't known all about him, and who hasn't helped to raise his name to the skies ? 'Why, it's Dewey every morning, it's Dewey all day, and then it's Dewey all night 'till morning again.\ The professor said that in regard to Manila, he knew no more than that they make poor cigars there and hemp to hang traitors. In regard to the hero's conduct since the victory he gave hin1 great credit. Dewey has proved him- self a solid serious tnan, and wise in that he refused the nomination for the presidency, offered by unscrupulous tnen. Tl1e other nations showed wise diplomacy in not taking part in the celebration, in that they were at peace with Spain. The professor then turned his attention toward Mexico, and dwelt on the attitude of that nation toward our own, closing with a few remarks on the worth of the president of that nation. Dean Ripton was the next speaker, and he dwelt on the historical importance of the battle of Manila. Heretofore the Atlantic has borne the commerce of the world. Dewey's victory, while it did not bring the Pacific into equal prominence, has steered the United States tow- ard a realization of its itnportance. In closing, the dean said : \In the world as it is to be, we occupying the centre, will stand as the first great democracy to cotn bine governtnental order with civil liberty, and with tremendous moral influence that should make the world better. In future year's the people will think of George as one of those great Americans, who in his country's crisis was equal to the emergency.\ Following this, '' Old Union Beside the Mohawk Vale\ was sung with a will. Dr. Ashmore, the last speaker, spoke on England's rule in India, as a lesson for the United States. England took charge of a people, the civiliza- tion of whom is almost beyond conception. In time, England's colonies will either become independent nations, or part of the home nation. England's rule is what it should be. If we rule as we ought, the time will come when the Philippines will form states or become part of the sovereign state. The exercises closed with the singing of ''My Country, 'Tis of Thee,\ and a rousing \George Washington.\

Y., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 4:14 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. \JIM THE COPPER,\ is a welcome figure on the campus these days. After last fall's experience without the eagle-eyed ''special,'' everyone hopes that from now on he will be a fixture. LACK of space prevents our publishing this week the names of the entering classes at the Albany Medical college, and Albany Law school. The lists will be printed in our next issue. THE FINANCIAL statement of the annual spring meet of the New York State Intercollegiate Ath- letic U:nion is published in another column, and is certainly very encouraging. The meet, it will be remembered, was held under Union's auspices, a.nd the balance in the treasury to be divided IN THIS issue we are glad to be able to publish the oration which took the first Blatchford medal last commencement, and in succeeding numbers we hope to print several more of the prize essays and orations of the graduating class. THE CHEERING at the R. P. I. game on Satur- day was away below the average. Good system- atic ''rooting'' has won too many games right here on our own campus for us to give it up, and perhaps if our yells had been as frequent or as loud in proportion to those of the score of R. P. I. men, there might have been a different tale to tell. On Saturday, Union will play Columbia at Albany and while it is important that the Garnet be well represented by ''rooters '' on that occasion, yet it is not nearly so imperative as that a large dele- gation of students accompany the team to Williams- town a week from Saturday when the Garnet will do battle with the Purple. ON ANOTHER page is printed a full explanation of the new system whereby the literary work in The Concordiensis may be taken as a substitute for regular essays and orations, together with a list of the dates on which the latter fall due this term. This system is now placed before the students for the first time, and it is entirely depen- dent for its success on the earnestness with which they enter into it. Of course the general aim of the plan is to arouse a deeper interest among the undergraduates in literary work, and at the same time by this very process to improve The Concordi- ensis. That it should be improved everyone has been ready to remark. But in the past, few, beside the editors themselves have shown any disposition ( to work for its betterment. Now an opportunity is given to every man in college to aid in making The Concordiensis more representative of under- graduate life at Union; and it is to be hoped that many men will take advantage of this opportunity. A literary editor is to be appointed before Decem- ber 1, 1899, and the selection will be made upon a between Hamilton and Union speaks well for the basis of work submitted previous to that date. management. Competition is open to all members of the senior \. l) ·6; r., I! '! I i ''

The editor-in-chief would like to confer with any men desiring to try for this position and will also be glad to meet any fresh- men desirous of trying a hand at literary work. AT THE opening of another college year it is perhaps apropos to urge that the students keep files of The Concordiensis-for we assume that every undergraduate is a subscriber. The import- ance of this practice cannot be overestimated, and it can be carried out with a little care. When you have read the paper through, don't let it lie about your room to be torn or lost. Just put the copy away for safe keeping, and at the end of the year you will have the history of the college year's doings in one compact- volume and invaluable for reference, not to mention the satisfaction with which you can turn to those pages when, in future years, the recollections of college years begin to grow dim. This matter is mentioned now and will be brought to your attention from time to time, because students are apt to forget it to their own regret. During commencement week last June several '99 men came to the business manager and asked for back numbers at any price to complete their very incomplete files. But only in a few instances were we able to supply the missing num- bers, and this year whatever copies remain over will be sent from week to week to preparatory schools and alumni. So now is the time to begin. Keep your file up to date. FOOTBA.LL SCO~ES. SATURDAY' SEP. 30· At New Haven, Yale, 23 ; Amherst, o. At Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 20; Lehigh, o.

12 THE ~coNOORDIENS1S. MAGAZINE QEVIEW. Outing for October. With a wealth of beautiful illustrations and with all the experts have to say concerning the great International Yacht Race, Outing for October is as fresh and wholesome as is the ocean breeze, which drove the white-winged fliers in their race for the America's storied cup. Long and vainly has Great Britain striven to regain possession of the trophy which signifies the yachting supremacy of the seas, and this time, if ever, is the opportunity for Sir Thotnas Lipton's stately Shatnrock. Designer Fife, sail-maker Ratsey, and all concerned have done their best, and the two swiftest yachts the world has ever seen will race upon their merits to a finish. Outing for October tells all about Shamrock and Columbia, their designers, owners and crews, for this is a yachting nutnber of the popular magazine of sport, travel and recreation. Other sports, however, are not neglected ; Outing never fails in this respect. General athletics, football, golf, tennis, the horse, gun and rod, kennel, and every depart- ment of sport in which a lady or gentleman can be interested receives the careful attention of writers who have become famous authorities in their chosen fields. In text and illustrations the number is one of the best that ever left the presses. BASEBALL ELECTION. The 1nembers of last spring's baseball team held a meeting last week and elected John D. Edwards, I 900, captain for next season. Edwards is an effective twirler and is a good man for the place. The new captain spoke of the baseball prospects for the coming spring as particularly favorable. There is no baseball material developed from r 902 but the freshtnan class this year has a number of men with base- ball ability, some of who1n have played on the teatns of the preparatory schools from which they have come. Manager Tuggey is at work on the schedule for the spring, and a good series of games will be offered. ALUMNI NOTES. News of Union's Sons in Many Classes. '4o ........... Ex:-Judge George F. Danforth, at one tirne on the New York state Court of Appeals bench, dropped dead in court at Rochester, Septe·tnber 25. He had just argued a case and taken his seat when stricken with apoplexy and expired two minutes later in an adjoining room. George F. Danforth was born in Boston, Mass., July 5, 1819. He was graduated at Union college in 184o, and after studying law began practice in Rochester, where he was eminently successful and soon rose to the front rank of the profession. In 1876 he was the Republican candidate for Judge of the Court of Appeals, of the state of New York, but \\'as defeated by Robert Earl, Union, '45· Two years latet· he was again nominated for a similar office, and after being elected took his seat on the bench Jan. I, 1879· Save during the period between Jan. I, r879, and 1881, when he was an associate judge of the Cout·t of Appeals, his practice has been uninter- rupted. Judge Danforth was a Republican and was a metnber of the judiciary commission of 189z, but had held no other office. On the 27th of April, 1846, he married Miss Frances J. Wright, daughter of Orrin and Frances Gould Wright of Pittsfield, Mass. 1. ) ~~ '54.Lintelligence has been received of the death of John D. Ostrom, class of '54· Mr. Ostrom after graduation from Union went to Texas and engaged in extensive ranching and farming. But after some years his health gave out and he was compelled to give up active life, going to Charlotteport, Florida, where he died last June. Mr. Ostro1n was a loyal alumnus of Old Union and often returned for commence- ment reunions. While in college he was identi- fied with every branch of college life and was a n1en\1ber of the Chi Psi fraternity. '64.-Abraham V. N. Powelson, his wife, son and daughtet visited the college during the first week in July. Mr. Powelson is a promi- nent lawyer in Middletown, N. Y. and he was

'90.-Fred. W. Brown, of Gloversville was in town Saturday. '95.-Arthur J. Kelly, a former metnber of the class of '95, was ordained to the priesthood at the cathedral of the Immaculate Conception at Albany, on Saturday, Sept. 23, and cele- bratod his first mass Sunday, at St. John's church, in this city. Next month Father J(elly will go to Rome to pursue a four years' course of study. '96.-Burt H. Boorn has accepted the chair of mathematics in Frederick college, Frederick, Md.

'98.-Thomas A. Crichton, continues this year as professor of oratory, English and Span- ish at Mercersburg Academy, Mercersburg, Pa. MONDAY'S COLLEGE MEETING. At the college meeting Monday tnorning, Manager Van Vla.ck made an earnest appeal on behalf of the musical clubs. He urged all those who had any ability along musical lines to come out and try for the clubs as there are rnany places left vacant by '99 men. As the selection of tnen is made after a competition has been held, the clubs are open to the best men and it is hoped that many will try and make the fight for places a hot one. Mr. Thomson spoke for The Concordiensis, explaining the new arrangetnent whereby work done for the college paper is credited to the writer in the English Department, in place of essays and orations. He said he hoped many would take advantage of this new system as by such a course they can l1elp the paper which represents the college, and at the sarne time do their English work. An appeal was made for a better scrub this week as there is a hard gatne to play Saturday when we tneet Columbia at Albany. Manager MacCulloch reminded all of their duty to go to Ridgefield Saturday and encourage the wearers of the garnet from the side lines. PERSONALS. Prof. Bennett spent Sunday at Altamont. Pembetton, '95, visited friends on the hill Friday. Stephen S. Reed, r9oo, has returned to college. Lent, r903, spent Sunday at Highlands with his family. W. G.

It will be reme1n be red that at the last college meeting in June the student body decided that for the college year of r899-1900 the form of the undergraduate publicstion be changed so as to provide for a combining of the monthly literary tnagazine, the Parthenon and the news weeki y, the Concordiensis, into one publication, a weekly to be known as the Concordiensis, to contain both literary and news matter, and to be under the control of one board of editors. Now in order that there be no lack of literary tnaterial submitted by the students it was suggested that the faculty might be willing to make such matter if accepted for publication, an equivalent of equal work in the department of rhetoric, i. e., of required essays and orations. This plat'l was taken up, a petition was drawn and presented to the faculty and granted by that body. The petition provides that: \During the college year of r899-1900 liter- ary contributions submitted by the students for the Concordiensis, and duly accepted therefor, shall be accepted by the faculty as a substitute in kind for regular work in the department of rhetoric.\ Now the titne has arrived for the carrying into execution this plan, and accordingly the following rules have been drawn up: I. All literary work, in order to be accepted, must be satisfactory to the head of the d-epart- ment of rhetoric (or to any one whom he tnay name) and to the editorial board of the paper; and if duly accepted, such work is to be an exact equivalent, so far as college requirements are concerned, to a required essay ot oration. II. Every student desiring to take advantage of such ofier shall register during the first week of the term with the head of the department of rhetoric, and shall hand in his contributions to the editor ot the Concordiensis at least two weeks before the date upon which is due the regular essay or oration of which it is to take the place. In case the manuscript is rejected,

THE CONCORDIENSlS. 15 the contributor shall be given notice at the earHest possible date after it is suhtnitted, and not less than eight days before the said essay or oration is due. III. No 1ndividual student shall be allowed to substitute new spa per work for more than one exercise during any college term. IV. This substitute work tnay be taken by any students in any of the four regular classes, except the first tenn sophomore and- third fresh- man. Rule II requires that all persons who are to substitute this Concordiensis work for regular essays tnust register with Prof. Hale during the first week of the term. This arrangement will not go into force until the winter term because of the unavoidable delay in publishing these rules. So if all of those who are going to take advantage of the change will hand their natnes at once to Prof. Hale, this registration will answer the purpose. As stated above these contributions to the paper must be handed in at least two weeks before the date on which are due the essays or orations of which they are to take the place. In accord with this, students in the classes eligible, will notice the dates below on which regular work is due at the department of Rhetoric. Freshman essays, 8oo words-Oct. r3, Oct. 27, Nov. 10, Nov. 24. Junior orations, about rooo words-Oct. 2'7. Junior essays, \ '' \ Nov. 24. Senior orations, \ \ \ Oct. 30. Senior essays, \ \ \ Nov. 27. CHANGES IN THE FACULTY. Through sotne mistake last week, the list of additions to the faculty did not appear in the first number of The Concordiensis. Today we publish the natnes of the new men who are to be with us as instructors, and whose connection with the co1lege, we trust, may not be short. In the brief time they have been with us they have already proved themselves excellent teachers. The department of Latin is to have a new teacher, and the man selected to fill the position is Curtis C. EushneU; Ph. D., a graduate of Yale in the class of'92 with the degree of A. B. Mr. Bushnell is well fitted for the place having had two years' experience in secondary school work and two years of teaching in college. He will take Jnstructor Bennett's place, who has been raised to the assistant professorship )n Greek. As instructor in mathematics, surveying and draughting, the trustees have engaged Mr. Lindsay Duncan, a graduate from the University of Maine in both the scientific and engineering courses. He was engaged for a time in practical work at the Bath Iron Works, and afterward entered Clark universitv at Worcester from which institution he received high letters of recommendation as did he also from Maine. The new instructor in Modern Languages is Mr. John L. Marsh, A. B., Lafayette, '93· He is a son of Prof. Marsh of Lafayette, the well known educator, and he was graduated V\·ith high honors, delivering the honorary oration with the va.ledicto1-y. Instructor JVlarsh has had two years' e)Cperience in teaching and has spent the past three years in study in Germany, France and Italy. INTEQCOLLEGIA TE. U,niversity of Vermont. As the ()Utcome of the troubles in the medi- cal departn1ent of the University of Vern1ont at Burlington, tbe entire faculty has resigned. The department has heretofore been only nominally llnder the supervision of the trustees of the university, and it is now expected that a reorganization 'vill be effected and the depart- ment put under the direct control of the trustees, as are the other departn'lents of the university. It is probable that nearly all the rnen1bers of the faculty will resume their positions. WILLIAMS. Captain Louis Draper and Coach \Joe\ Hazen of Williams College, are working hard to put a strong eleven on the gridiron this year. The candidates for positions on the team num- ber thirty, ten of whom played on the 'Varsity last year. Ca. pta in Dr r will play right half.

16 THE OONCORDIENSIS. Q. P. I., 6; UNION, 5. Polytechnics Win Opening Game on a Fumble. The first football gatne of the season was played on the catnpus, Saturday, Sept. 30, with the tearn representing Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of Troy. The game was the first for both teams and each had been training hard in anticipation of it. So, when at three o'clock the two elevens trotted out to the field for a prelhninary \warn1 ing np\ each realized that only hard work could get the game, and accord- ingly played \vith a detennination to win. From the first line-up one could see that the teams were quite evenly matched,\ and when, after the second down, Aldrich got the ball on a fumble and ran 45 yards for a touchdown, even R. P. I's supporters. were surprised. But this setback was only temporary and shortly after, Paige was sent across R. P. I.'s line after a series of steady gains. The home team was greatly handicapped by the inability of Carver and Finnegan to play; but even then, it sl1ould have won. While both teatns fumbled badly, the playing was nearly all in R. P. l's territory and in the first half Union's backs had no trouble to find holes in their opponents' line. Twice during the gatne Union fu1nbled at critical n1on1ents when touchdowns seetned not far off, and then the ball would be kicked out of danger. Union excelled R. P. I. in team work and offensive work but was lamentably weak on the defense. In the second half there was sotnething decidedly wrong, but Captain Fenton lays it to no one individual. He says that while he was disappointed at the result of the game still he does not feel discouraged as to the future success of the tea1n. The game in detail follows: Kick off by R. P. I. Weed catches ball and advances it 10 yards. Union fumbles and Aldrich runs 45 yards for a touchdown. Goal kicked by Judd. Paige kicks off, but ball soon goes to Union on downs. Gordon and Clark by end and line plays advance the ball to R. P. I's 5 yard line, and Paige goes through center for a touchdown. Paige fails at trial for goal. Score, R. P. I., 6; Union, 5· During the rest of this half the ball remains near the center of the field. Second half. Paige kicks to Polytechnic'~ 30 yard line. R. P. I. forced to kick. Slack makes 5 yards and the ball goes to R. P. I. on downs. No gain, Union's ball. Three 5 yard gains by Gordon and Slack. Gordon encircles the right end for 30 yards. R. P. I's ball on downs. Ward 1nakes 35 yards around Thebo. Union takes ball on a forward -pass but looses it on a fumble after IO yards is made. Doty fumbles and Union advances ball to R. P. I's 20 yard line. Another fumble and R. P. I. kicks. Union returns kick and on ftunble kicks again. Titne is called with the ball in R. P. I's hands. The line-up : UNION. R. P. I.

®NG®RDIBNSIS. VoL. XXIII. UNION 0'0LLEGE, OO'TOBER 11, 1899. No. 3. UNION AND UNIVERSITY EXTENSION. Special Course of Lectures on Saturday .Mornings Instituted. Numerous inquiries and requests have tnade it evident that there is a desire on the part of tnany in Schenectady and its vicinity to avail themselves of such special advantages as the presence of Union College tnakes possible, and to meet this desire the authorities of the college have decided to ofrer several courses of instruc- tion to be given on successive Saturday morn- ings, beginning October I 4, r899· While the instruction in general will take the fonn of lectures, opportunity will be given for free dis- cussion, and courses of supplementary reading or study will be outlined. The attendants upon each course will constitute in reality a class, as that term is used, to distinguish from an audience. Those who so elect may be examined and if the 1·esult justifies it a certificate will be issued by the professor in charge. For each of these courses a fee of $5 has been fixed, and no course will be begun unless there are at least ten names entered for it. Applica- tion for admission should be made to Dean B. H. Ripton. The time set apart for these lectures is fron~ 9 to r 2 o'clock on Saturday morning, and as each lecture will cover a period of but one hour, those who wish may take tnore than one course. The specific hour for each lecture cannot be named until after all the entries have been received. The schedule will then be announced. The following is a brief outline of the courses offered: Mediaeval History.-Prof. B. H. Ripton. The tniddle ages will be studied as a transi- tion period in history, a period in which the modern world was developed out of the ancient civilization by n1eans of new political and religious influences; the addition to the civilized world of new peoples and a new spiritual and ecclesiastical force, the Christian reHgion and church . The following topics with others will be dis- cussed: The Unity of the Roman world and its attetnpted renewal in tl1e Holy Roman etnpire of the German nation. Feudalism as the frarnework of tnediaeval life. The church the inspirer of tnediaeval ideas. Conflict of church and state. The crusades and their influence upon the development of Euro- pean civilization. The fonnation of the great nations of modern Europe. The Renaissance, the cotnpletion of the work of the middle ages in a new life of politics, literature, science, art, econotnics and religion. Rhetoric and style.-Prof. Edward Everett Hale, Jr. I. Funda1nental Principles; Itnportance of Thought. 2. Text-books and Aids to Rhetorical Study. 3· Division of the Subject. 4· Narration and Description. 5. Exposition. 6. Argutnentation. 7· Paragraphing. 8. Diction. 9· Relation of Logic to Rhetoric. ro. Means and Methods. Ten lectures on the \Life and Monuments of Antiquity,\ by Prof. Ashmore. Greek Literature.-Assistant Professor Ben- nett. I. The History of Greek studies in the n1odern world. This lecture will endeavor to show how the study of Greek becatne an important part of European education and what service it rendered to the progress of thought and culture. II. The Value of Greek in modern education. This lecture will treat of the claims of Greek to

6 :THE OONCORDIENSIS. a place in modern curricula and estimate its value as a study of students of today. III. The Origin of Hotneric poems ; a brief history of the discussion regarding the author- ship of the Homeric poems, and a statement of current opinion regarding the question. IV. Homer in the ancient world. This lecture will describe how and why Homer became the ''Bible of the Greeks.'' V. Characteristics of the Homeric poems ; an analysis of the qualities that go to make up that unique poetic style which we call Homeric. VI. Attic tragedy. VII. Attic comedy. Lecture VI and VII will trace the history of the Attic drama and will set forth the distinctive character of Greek tragedy and comedy. VIII. Socrates ; a character sketch and an estimate of his place among the teachers of men. IX. The Intellectual conditions of ancient Athens; an attempt to show how the social conditions of ancient Athens were promotive of that alertness of mind for which the Athenians were noted, and tended to produce a great literature. X. Athenian education in the fifth and fourth centuries B. C. This lecture will show how the Greek boy studied and how closely his education was related to his life as a citizen. Life and Evolution of Living fonns.-Prof. J. H. Stoller. I. Protoplasm or living matter ; the peculiar substance by which alone the phenomena of life are manifested. What is life? How did life originate? 2. The Organism or living body. What is a plant? What is an animal?

Sketch of the history of opinion upon the causal factors of organic evolution. (Theo• ries of LaMarck, Darwin, Spencer, and ot.}lers.) 10. Man's place in nature in the light of biology. INTE~COLLEGIA TE F~OOTBALL. The elevens of the large universities are just now assun1ing definite fonn. The hard pre- liminary work of the past month and the two or three practice gatnes have been putting them into shape for their games with each other. Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Cor- nell and Brown are all beginning to exhibit a form which is pretty certain to fortell the results of the weeks to come. Yale, with the work of fonning an eleven out of fresh material and Harvard, with ahnost an entire veteran line, have had far different roads to travel. Although Yale has run up good scores against her oppo- nents, thus far these scores, compared with Harvard's, show that the tide is running toward Cambridge again this year. Princeton, it is expected, will make a splendid showing. The announcement, however, on Friday, that unless a tnan is absolutely free from conditions he will not be permitted to play against any other college eleven, struck hard in the Tigers' lair. Four of the 'varsity and several prominent sub- stitutes were by this rule summarily disposed of. The score of Princeton, 5; Annapolis, o, shows the first effect of the new rule. The surprise of Saturday's games was the tie· ing of Pennsylvania by Brown. The former eleven will have to take a strong brace if she expects to do anything this fall. Cornell has rather a disappointment in her eleven this year. Both Hamilton and Williams held her down to I 2 points. The teatn is play- ing steady ball, however, and a decided change may soon take place. No exact comparison of Hamilton and Union or of Union and Williams is able to be made thus far. The Williatns gatne on Saturday, no doubt, will show Union more clearly how she stands in regard to the only eleven that was victorious over her last season.

THE CONCO:RDlENSlS. 1 THE ENGLISH NEWSP APEQ. A Pew Notes and Comparisons. One of the most interesting things that strike the American in England is the difference between the New York daily newspaper and that which is ·published in London. With the exception that the same language is employed in both, the two have very little in common. A traveller from the United States takes up the London Times, the Daily Telegraph, the Morning Post, the Daily Chronicle or the Standard and looks for news from his own country. He is disappointed. A brief paragraph under the caption, H United States,\ informs him that there has been another battle in the Philippine Islands, or that Secretary Alger has resigned, and there it ends. On another page the American markets are quoted, but this is for the express benefit of the London Stock Exchange. On looking further he discovers that similar brief paragraphs are devoted to the latest polit- ical news in Australia, Canada and other British colonies, and that in fact a point or two of generally acknowledged importance is touched upon in the case of each and nearly every political division of the civilized world-and all this within a single page, or page and a column of the \daily\ in question. No better sumtnary of the world's geography can be had for a penny than is to be found in the London morning news. But the American reader, in1pressed with the size and commercial importance ot his own country, expects to find the latter treated by the British press as though it were of para- mount irnportance an1ong the nations of the earth, and is not a little piqued to discover that in the eyes of the average Englishtnan the great United t;tates is a very far off quarter of the terrestrial sphere, of value chiefly as a trading post, and inhabited, like South Africa or the East Indies, by a people of little refinetnent or education. To send a man to Australia or America is an expression still con1 mon atnong Englishmen, and is synonymous with sending him to the ends of the earth ; and be it noted that by ''America\ is meant always the United States. The American is not :flattered at being thus placed on a footing with the Australasian or the African, and of course were this done officially, or with a purpose~ it might be resented. But I am not alluding to the attitude of the British Government toward this country, nor to that of individuals connected with the government or in any sense representing it ; but merely to the common run of people, who are interested only indirectly in public affairs, and have little care for anything outside of England. Among these there is ~tn indifference, born almost wholly of ignorance, to American concerns, and for this ignorance the press is imn1ediately responsible. The American more- over begins to feel a little homesick on being thus cut off from news of his native land, and proceeds to ponder somewhat resentfully upon the advantage enjoyed by the English traveller in America, who may read column upon column in the New York papers about everything that is taking place in the old world. Finally he lays aside the paper and awaits the arrival in London of the Paris Herald. The Paris edition of the New York Herald reach.es London at six in the evening. This miserable little sheet is as far removed, in solid value and in dignified expression, from the regular London daily paper, as a ditne novel from Macaulay's History; yet it is much in demand both in England and on the continent, for it supplies the American abroad with the news that he craves and cannot get elsewhere until it is a week or ten days old. On the other hand the English newspaper is marvellously well adapted to the needs and the temperament of the British public. It is brief, instead of being diffuse like its American cousin. It is also accurate-a virtue which the most ardent patriot and enthusiastic journalist in this country would scarcely claim to be a distinguishing characteristic of the New York press. It is the accuracy, the reliability of the English daily newspaper, that most impresses the Atnerican who has lived many years in England. There are yellow journals in Great Britain as in America, but the morning dailies already enumerated and 1nany mo1·e besides are true blue, and may be depended upon as no others

8 i'HE CONOORDtENS!S. in the world can be. Moreover the London morn- ing paper is well written, while many of its editor- ials are models of English prose-writing. It needs no long stay in England to perceive this, and the Atnerican journalist has been keen enough to acknowledge it. In fact the superior style in which the best English dailies are edited has proved an incentive as well as an example to journalistn in 1nany lands. Such general cotnparisons as these need not excite \feeling.\ No one will deny that the proprietor of an American newspaper is a more enterprising person than his English brother, and that a single issue of his journal contains more ''news\ than can be found in a dozen nutnbers of the Titnes or the Standard. It was the New York World, if report be true, that first announced to the English people the sinking of the flagship of the J\1editerranean squadron, off Cyprus, sotne years ago, and the death by drowning of Admiral Tryon with three hundred of his crew. The American journal had correspondents in the East, who telegraphed the news to New York, whence it reached London in advance of all other reports of the disaster. It is such enterprise as this (coupled with that which seeks always to furnish elaborate details) that appeals especially to the Atnerican tetnperatnent. The English1nan is content to wait. He is satisfied also with essentials, and fails to understand that eagerness to arrive at minute particulars which is so characteristic of the American. Indeed, it is not too 1nuch to say that his sense of proportion, if not exactly tnore true than that of the American, is at least less easily affected or upset; and this difference is reflected in the press of the two countries. Con1parisons, though perhaps invidious at titnes, are often interesting and are always instructive; and a con1parison of so1ne of the n1ethods and peculiarities in journalistn of two such great nations as England and the United States is far frotn being devoid of suggestion as to the temperatnent and tendencies of the two peoples. Indeed it is on this account in the main that one becornes interested in the cotnparison. SIDNEY G. AsHMORE. COLUMBIA, 21; UNION, 0. The Former's Weight Too Much for the Garnet. The football eleven suffered another defeat at Albany on Saturday, Columbia's team, averag- ing twenty pounds heavier in weight, clearly outplaying them. The score, 21 too, is larger than it might have been bad it not been for several unfortunate fumbles. The general field work of both elevens was ragged and often care- less. Union showed an improvement over her work in the R. P. I. game but yet it lacked steadiness. In the first half Columbia had little difficulty in forcing the ball wherever she chose, but in the second, Union settled down and held her opponents in excellent style. Although Colun1- bia excelled in both offensive and defensive play, still it was not of a character that would stand tnuch chance in a gatne with a larger 'varsity team of the satne weight. Union was unable to t-nake much ground around the ends and largely refrained from atten1pting it but had, on the contrary, considerable success in bucking the line. The ends back forrnation was attended with good results. A kicking game was played by Union, and Paige proved hitnself a good punter. Columbia, however, seldotn failed to ad vance the ball twenty or twenty-five yards in return. The day was cool and cloudy altl1ough sun- shine occasionally covered the field. The side lines were well filled and a stnall audience was in the grand stand. Governor Roosevelt and his family were in attendance. He received a nutnber of enthusiastic cheers frotn both Colun1- bia and Union men. Several other state digni- taries were present. The garnet was the pre- dotninant color on both grand stand and field. Little enthusiastn was 111anifested on either side although both colleges had a good sized under- graduate attendance. Cheering, which did a great deal toward saving and winning a doubt- ful game on a strange campus last year, was

THE CONC'ORDIENSIS. 9 noticeably absent among Union tnen on the side lines. Larendon at left half and Sitnons at full played a splendid advancing game for the blue and white, while Fenton, Shaw, Finnegan, Weed and Paige did the steadiest work for the garnet. Union won the toss and chose to defend the northern goal. Columbia kicked out of bounds on Uni()n's 25 yard line. On the first play Slack fumbled and Columbia secured the ball. On the next play, Larendon was given the ball and sent around right end for a touchdown. The time of play was but a minute and a half. No goal was kicked. Score, Columbia, 5; Union, o. On the kick off Columbia advanced the pig- skin to l1er thirty yard line. A hole was tnade for ten yards but the ball was given to Union on offside play. Colutnbia itnmediately regained it on a futnble. Denham, Stnythe and Laren- don quickly carried the ball to the fifteen yard line, when Union secured it on holding. Finne- gan, Paige and Slack, by a num her of hard plunges, advanced the leather twenty-three yards. Columbia braced herself and secured it on downs, Larendon and Denham, in three plays, forcing Union to her seven yard line, after which Simons went through the line for a touchdown. Bruce again failed to kick the goal. Score, Columbia, 10; Union, o. Simons caught and carried the ball to Colum- bia's forty-five yard line. Fifteen yards through center by Jones, two dashes around right end by Larendon followed, and then some offside play gave Union the ball on her thirty-five yard line. A fun'lble gave it back to Colutnbia but holding in the line again gave it to Union on her twenty-five yard line. Paige made five yards through center but the next two plays were attended with loss. Union made a hard stand at this point but in vain, for Larendon in a few plays was pushed over. The Union time-keeper called time before the last two plays but the other time-keeper's watch was at variance, and the referee decided to allow the touchdown. Score, Columbia, I 5 ; Union, o. In the second half on the kick off, Columbia advanced to the thirty yard line. Columbia was forced to kick but a Union man fumbled and it was Columbia's ball in the center of the field. Berian, Jones and Larendon by end plays carried the ball to Union's fifteen yard line where it was lost on a fumble. Paige made seven, Thebo one, and Finnegan three yards when Columbia held us on downs. Dunning tackled his tnan five vards back and on the next \' play Fenton secured the ball on a fumble.

EXTRACT from an exchange, \Paige of Union is one of the punting fihds of the season. '' Nearly a week ago we wrote for the names of the entering class, and at this writing the list has not arrived. THERE ought to be a large delegation of students to accompany the football team to Williamstown on Saturday. As all the league .games are to be played on our own campus and the other out-of- town games are at some distance fron1 Schenec- tady, the Williams game has an exclusive call on the fellows. Last year, it will be remembered, a large crowd of students cheered the team on to victory, and this year Captain Fenton is anxious to have the the same support from the side lines. The cost of the trip is insignificant, so let there be many to go. SATURDAY'S game was not without its good results. To be sure, it isn't pleasant to be beaten, but when it is taken into account that the average weight of the Columbia team was twenty pounds heavier than that of Union, a difference of twenty- one points in the score is not so great. It is argued that this is Columbia's :first year at foot- ball; but surely the men who make up her team are not without previous experience in the game, and though Union is by no means on the gridiron for the first time yet even is it not true that we are playing raw material on the 'Varsity this year? Then too, Columbia has about ten times as many men to select from as has Union. In the light of these facts the victory is seen to be not so much out of proportion; but, even so, it certainly has its lessons. Every one acknowledges that there was too much fumbling in both teams;. but aside from this, Union may be well satisfied with the showing tnade by her representatives. In the offensive SINCE the victory of one of the two was ineivtable, work there was but the one above named fault. it was rather too bad that both Columbias couldn't The men played good straight football throughout win on Saturday, wasn't it? and the team work in both the offensive and THE CONCORDIENSIS is ready to head a petition to the trustees that the appropriation for clerk hire at the Albany Medical college be increased. defensive was a marked improvement over the week before. With this week's practice the one pre- dominant weakness should be remedied so that on Saturday there will be no trouble about ''hanging onto'' the ball.

'rHE OONOORblENStS. 11 THE SP·ECTQES OF THE PAST. 'Tis not the hollow eye nor ghostly form Of friends long dead that haunt the troubled brain; 'Tis not the piercing shriek of battle's storm, That echoes frmn the plains of youth again. The spectres that we see in deep r.emorse And fear that life is tottering to its fall, Are those of deeds misdone within the course Of days, which shade the sun with glomny pall. The loving hands we bruised as they embraced, The gentle voice we scoffed in angry tone, The kindly acts so roughly we debased, The parent right so oft we did dethrone- These all are spectres in our later life, The phantoms that cast darkness in the way, The cup of sorrow for the weary strife, The blighted hope to crown the closing day. JoHN McNAB, 1901. THE COLLEGE OF PHA~MACY OPENS. The Albany College of Pharmacy, one of the departments of the university, was opened last week. The exercises were presided over by Willis G. Tucker, who made a brief address in introducing Theodore J. Bradley, Ph. G., who delivered the opening address. After he had concluded President Raytnond spoke briefly. SENIORS ELECT OFFICE~S.

The marriage of Miss Marcia Johnson, daugh- ter of Mr. and Mrs. Williatn Johnson of 702 Union street, Schenectadv, to Mr. Hubbell ., Robinson also of this city occurred at the First Reformed church October 4· It was an Alpha Delt. afiair throughout as the groom, the officiating clergyman, the best man and the groomsmen all wore the star and cres- cent and the church was decorated with the colors of the fraternity-green and white. President Raymond perfonned the ceremony, Prof. John I. Bennett was best man and the grootnsmen were John C. Van Yoast of Sche- nectady, Howard Pemberton of Albany, Harry T. Warnick of Amsterda1n, James N. Vander Veer of Albany and Willard S. Yates of Lincoln, Neb. After a reception at the home of the bride's parents the couple left for a trip through the south.

12 THE OONOORDIENSlS. A DUAL MAQQIAGE. The Twin Brothers Scofield, '97, the Grooms. The Albany Argus of recent date has this to say of two recent graduates of Union: \Born on the satne day, educoted in the same university, having the same degree of C. E., the brothers Scofield, natives of Youngstown, 0., maintained their duality in this city Thursday evening, by being married at the same time by the same minister. (The doub]e ceremony was a surprise even to the most intin1ate guests and the ushers for it was supposed by all that only one couple was to be tnarried, vv bile the twin brother had come 1nerely to act as his brother's best mad. Greatly to the surprise of those present the dual ceretnony proceeded, the offici- ating clergyman, Rev. W. M. Brundage, pas- tor of the Unitarian church, only having been previously infonned of the intention of the twin brothers.) \One ·of the twins, Lyman M. Scofield, has been a resident of Albany for the past year and has resided at No. r6 High street, the home of his bride-elect, Miss Zaidia Lyon. Mr. Sco- field has been ernployed by a local concern as a civil engineer. His brother is Glenn M. Sco- field of New York city, also a civil engineer, in the employ of the Youngstown Bridge Company of):.,.. oungstown, Ohio, the home of the father of the twins. ''The brothers are '!7 years of age and gradu- ated together from Union in the class of'97. They were well known at Union and had tnany friends in Schenectady. Both were well up in their class and it was a remarkable fact that the per- centages that they got in all of their studies averaged about the same. They received their degree at the same time from President A. V. V. Raymond, of Union, and received his per- sonal congratulations and compliments. Only when the titne catne for entering actively upon the pursuit of their profession did they separate, one going to New York, the other locating in this city. They probably began their love- making on the same day and perhaps Cupid shot twin shafts from his bow, for the culmina- tion of their courtship was the double ceremony of Thursday. ''Arrangements were made for the wedding of Miss Lyon and Lynn M. Schofield, and when the guests had assembled on the night of the wedding, they awaited the bridal party which entered the parlor in the following order: The Rev. W. M. Brundage came first, then the ushers, LeRoy Ripley, class of 1900, Union college, and D. J. I-Ioyt, class of 1902, Albany Medical college. Then came Lynn M. Scofield and Miss Zaida Lyon, and finally Glenn M. Scofield and Miss Rose Cleevely, of Youngs- town, 0. The guests believed that the second couple were to act as best man and bridesmaid, respectively, and were surprised cotnpletely when Mr. Brundage repeated the questions first to one couple, then to the other. Then it all dawned on those present that they were witness- ing a dual marriage. After the ceremony both couples went to New York on the night boat. Mr. and Mrs. Lynn M. Scofield will reside at No. 456 Hamilton street, while Mr. and Mrs. Glenn M. Scofield will reside in New York.'; FOOTBALL SCORES. WEDNESDAY, OcTOBER 4· Harvard, 13 ; Bowdoin, o.

At the first meeting of the Philotnathean Literary Society several mernbers of the class of I903 were elected to metnbership and the following officers were chosen for tbe fall tern1 : President, E. R. Cnllings, r 900; vice-president, s. s. Read, Igoo; secretary, L. vV. Bloch, 1902; treasurer, T. H. Wight, 1901 ; chairn1an of executive comtnittee, L. N. Broughton, 1900. ADELPHICS :READY FOR WORK. The Adelphic Literary Society bas reorgan- ized and elected the following officers for the fall term: President, John M. Tuggey, I9oo; vice-president, John McNab, 190I; secretary, H. M. Parsons, I9o2; treasurer, C. P. Dalton, 1900. A comn1ittee has been appointed to have the rooms papered. Other tnuch needed itnprove- ments will be n1ade in the furnishings of the hall. The victory of the Adelphic teatn at the Allison-Foote prize debate last winter and the award of the fifty dollar prize have given an impetus and incentive to the society toward more enthusias1n, and an unusually successful year is anticipated. The Philotnathean and the Adelphic literary societies both offer great advantages to the students. Membership in either one is an inexpensive luxury and inastnuch as a metnber receives nothing but improvetnent by his metn- bership, one or the other of these societies should have not only the support but the active co-operation of every tnan in college.

14 THE CON\CORbTENSlS. AT THE ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. The forty-ninth year of the Albany Law School opened the last week of the month under very favorable auspices.

The authorities at Yale have abolished the plan of student waiters in the dining hall. In the past, thirty odd students have officiated as waiters, in return receiving their board free; but it is now proposed to extend the meal hours, etnploy colored waiters, and so improve the service.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 15 SUNDAY SEQVICES. CAMPUS CHAT. :President Qaymond Leads the Afternoon Meeting. A Sunday afternoon service at five o'clock in the chapel is to be one of the regular features of the college Y. M. C. A. work from now on. The service is to be one large! y of song, and the address will be short, Dr. Raymond conducting the m,eetings. The service last Sunday was both pleasant and profitable. A number of students assetn- bled at the hour appointed, and after joining in the singing of hytnns, listened to the president's forceful words. Dr. Raytnond said in substance that the true test of a man is his final aim in life. If a man wishes to be of the kingdom of God he must have the kingdom of God in him, that is he must be imbued with the spirit of righteousness. It is often erroneously taught that the greatest gifts may be had for the asking. This is not so. The greatest gifts are to be acquired, not merely through the asking, but must be won, rnust be gotten by trade, something cotnmensurate n1ust be given in return. There is no royal road to wisdom, to good natne, to righteousness. If we are to gain advantage from our college careers, labor and pains must be given in return. If we wish to be forgiven we must give up our sins. If we wish a good name we must win it in exchange for a life of righteousness. Christ was given a name which is above every other name, but it was the reward of a life's devotion to the cause of humanity. If we with to benefit others we must banish all thoughts of selfishness. Every man proves his character by the aim of his life and his devotion to this aitn. Prof. Olin H. Landreth of the engineering department has been appointed by Mayor Duryee of this ·city to be one of the city's three delegates to the New York State Commerce Convention to be held in Utica, October ro, r 1 and 12. Items of Interest Discussed on the Hill. The students of the Albany Law School and Albany Medical College were entertained at a reception given in their honor by the Albany Y. M. C. A. last week. Prof. Frederick Robertson Jones delivered an instructive address on \rfhe ItlJ.portance of Expansion to the Laborer,\ before the Schenec- tady Labor Lyceum, Sunday afternoon. At a n1eeting of last spring's track. teatn, held Friday afternoon, Frederick Morthner Davis, 1900, of New York, was unanimously elected captain of the track team for the spring of 1900. Among the alumni noticed at Saturday's game were : Prof. Cornelius E. Franklin, '83 ; Fred- erick M. Eames, '95 ; Frederick L. Greene, '99 ; Malcolm G. Thomas, '98; vVillis E. Merrirnan, Jr., '98, and George G. Jones, '99· At their first tneeting the tnernbers of the freshman class elected officers for the year. As usual, an attempt was made to keep the names secret until the banquet, but the truth leaked out and following is a list of the officers : President, William J. Dickenson, Burlington, N. Y. ; vice-president, George C. MacFarlane, Towanda, Pa. ; secretary, DeForrest W. Weed, Binghamton ; treasurer, Edward H. Rider, Unadilla. THE PQIZE SCHOLARSHIPS.

THE ®NG®RDIENSlS. VoL. XXIII. UNION COLLE·GE., OCTOBER 18, 1899. No. 4. uA NEIGHBO:Q IN THE FA\R EAST.\ The Hon. S. W. Rosendale Delivers the First Lecture of the Year. On Friday afternoon, Oct. I3, the first lecture of the season was given by Hon. S. W. Rosen- dale, who spoke on \Our Neighbors in the Far East.\ In introducing the speaker President Ray- m<:>nd remarked that Dewey has been received as few heroes have ever been. This is right, as his character both as a 1nan and an officer is deserving of it. However his name does not stand for victory alone, but for the entrance of An1erica into a new world. So it is our privilege and duty to find out as much as we can about our neighbors and especially that very interesting people, the Japanese. Among the incidents of his trip to Japan, Mr. Rosendale told of how a day was lost when the steamer crossed the line at I 8o 0 and began to reckon east of Greenwjch.· They were then directly south of Alaska· an.d-this led the speaker to mention the fact that the line passing midway between Maine and the western extremity of Alaska would have to be drawn Ioo miles out to sea, west of San Francisco. The approach to Yokohama, with its splendid wharves, beautiful scenery and the sun shining on grand old Fugiyama in the back ground, has been described too often to need of detailed word-pictures but, as in the case of Mr. Rosen- dale's arrival, it is often a failure because of mist shutting off the best part of the picture. Japan is as verdant as Ireland and there is a great Yariety and abundance of fruits in the empire. The sight is gratified on every hand by beautiful scenery, tnountains, hills and highly cultivated lands, all adding to the picture. Even steep hills are in a state of cultivation, the sides being terraced so as to be of use. Of the 147 ,ooo square miles in the islands, only I 2 per cent. is in a state of cultivation, and much of that has been won by the fanner only after hard work. If one should be suddenly transported from Alaska to Japan one could not tell by the people that he were in a different country. The cotn- plexions of the people of both lands are the same and many of their habits also resemble each other. The Japanese are very graceful people and their manner of salutation is especially so. They do not shake hands, and consider kissing vulgar but bow with dignity and make a hissing noise which is a sign of satisfaction. Everything in the country is srnall. Their houses are little cottages; their farms, little plots ; their railroads and cars, miniatures, their pipes and dishes on a small scale, and most of · their trees and sht·ubs dwarfs. The only really big things in the country are their mountains and their fears of Russia. Japan has always been governed by the upper class who have dragged the lower classes along through feudalism. Now education has brought them out of this state and we only find relics of it in museums. The country has a Constitu- tion, Cabinet and Parliatnent. European cloth- ing is worn by all professional men and by many of the lower classes. The only time that the educated class return to their native coshunes is in the evening when they often put on their comfortable dress to rest. It is left to the women to keep up the customs of the country in the dress which is so well known to us through photographs. It is natural for us to compare them with the Chinese, and although in America the Japanese would have the advantage of the comparison, atnong the merchants who have direct dealings with both, the opposite is the case. The

6 'FHE OONCORDIENSIS. Chinese are stricti y honest and their word is better than a '''Jap's\ bond any time. The Japanese admit their failing and give as a reason for it that merchants have never been held in respect, so the lower classes have gone into business. In all the large business houses and banks of Japan the accountants and the m,en who handle the tnony are Chinese, for they 1nake better clerks and are more honest. Japan is now recognized as a modern power. All persons within her boundaries are subject to her laws. Her feeling toward America is most friendly fo1· she re.cognizes that we will tnake the best neighbors since we will not try to grab land frotn her nor work against her in case she should go to war. The evolution of a people from the state of semi-civilization into one of civilization has taken place right before our eyes, yet the changes have been so rapid that we have needed the subtnarine cable to keep us posted. Within a short time we have learned of the adoption of a gold standard and of a new treaty with this country and England. The Japanese have even reached such a stage that there is a demand for American novels and sotne have been translated into their language. They have a constitution, emperor, cabinet, legislature, civil and criminal codes, railroads, newspapers, magazines, tele- phones, telegrapl1s, a navy patterned after the English, an army after the German, police and fire departments, and a school systetn like our own. . They realize the value of the English language for they have no alphabet but use a character for each word and the least number they can get along with is 4000. English is now taught in the schools and is becoming the language of business. The Japanese do not treat their women as do the other Orientals, putting them ahnost on a level with the animals ; nor yet have they reached our level. They consider thetn as weak and inferior beings, and atnong the lower classes the women work in the field, sometimes even being yoked with an animal. There are three laws which we might say cover the actions of the woman: obedience to father before marriage, obedience to husband after marriage, and obedi- ence to son in case of widowhood. The earthquakes play an important part in Japan as there are forty-one active volcanoes in the islands and the loss by death is at timei fearful, as in 1896, when 4o,ooo souls were lost at one stroke of a tidal wave. As to climate one can find almost any variety, as Japan extends from the far north almost to the equator. There is a greater fall of rain at Tokio than at Greenwich, and the dampness is so penetrating that there is always one room in the house where there is a fire to dry out the clothing. The J ananese can furnish us with good mechanics and excellent mill hands. Of course men are paid rediculously small vvages, laborers receiving from 7Yz to I zYz cents a day, carpen- ters 22 Yz cents for a day of IO hours, the police from $4.50 to $5.00 a month, and a station master $7 .oo a month. Clothing is always tnuch cheaper than here, business suits costing from $9 to $Io, and dress suits $zo. It seems to us that everything is done the reverse of the right way in Japan, for their books begin at our ends with the \foot notes\ at the top, the newspapers use a full stop at the beginning of articles, the wine comes before the meal, one mounts or harnesses at the right, the color for tnourning is white, and in addressing a letter they put the country first, then the city, street and natne. In their religious worship they go to one of the many tetnples, sing a song to attract the attention of the God, repeat their wishes to him and then clap their hands to show that they are through. They make no pretence at reading their religious authority, for there are 6771 volun1es in it, but they believe if they revolve the whole lot three times it is equal to reading it. They are really ancestor worshippers, although they are such admirers of nature and take such pains to select beautiful spots for their tetnples that one is tempted to call them nature worshippers. The juxtaposition of the ancient and the modern in Japan is what makes us marvel. Here we see boats towed by human horses going

THE C·ONCORD!ENSIS. 7 along a canal and right nearby electric cars and the bicycle. A few extracts from a newspaper published ther·e show that many modern ideas have reached them. For instance : \the employees of a mill went on a strike because of disbatisfaction over their New Year pre .. sents ; \ '''a burglar entered the house of Nika- yamo and 'annexed' two watches ; \ ''The Prime Minister has been appointed 'High Scrubber of the Coffin of her Majesty, the Etnpress,' but so1ne doubt of his ability is expressed because of his great age ; \ and this advertisement of a hotel, ''We wash our customers in the latest and most approved man- ner; ladies, $2.00 per hundred; n1en, $3.00 per hundred.\ So whether we have been most impressed with the stea1n whislte of progress or with the deep note of the bronze bell of antiquity or with the view of Fugiyama which is ever new, we leave Japan with the n1elodious farewells ringing in our ears, reminders of their never changing hospitality.

The Garnet Goes Down Before the Purple in a Well Contested Game. In a hard fought game last Saturday, Willian1s defeated Union by a score of twelve to five. It was a struggle full of exciting incidents, for the issue was for sotne titne in doubt. The purple, indeed, scored her total number of points before Union secured her five, yet nevertheless, there was a time between the two first touchdowns when, but for an unfortunate fumble, it appeared that the score would have been tied. Both sides did their tallying in the first half. Aided mainly by the brilliant running of the ends by Draper, Williams brought the score up to twelve points to our nothing, but with scarcely a minute to spare Paige made the sensational play of the day. The ball was at the twenty- two yard line, our backs had been smashing at the purple line with little effect and it was thought the only chance of scoring lay in a try for goal. The signal was given, the ball passed back to Weed, and placed by him in the correct position. The line held well and \Biddy\ kicked a very clever goal. The kick was from slightly back of the thirty-five yard line. The play caught the Berkshire eleven completely unawares, and Williams men at the gatne said it was the first one of its kind on Weston field. The second half contained so1ne very clever football playing. Each side played snappy, fast ball. Union's ends and tackles did better work in breaking up end plays. Her backs did so1ne excellent bucking the line. Gordon, especially, bucked like a veteran. He did not run blindly, but on the contrary, used excellent judgtnent in selecting his hole. In offensive play the five center men in the Union line handled those opposite thetn in splendid style. Williatns' gains, as before, were principally round the ends. She found considerable diffi- culty in straight ahead bucking. A very pretty exhibition of football was given by our men during this half. Williams had advanced the pigskin despite desperate resist

This brought the ball four yards from the line and things looked rather poorly for us. Our men on the side lines cheered for all they were worth, while the eleven braced itself for the final stand. Once, twice, and thrice the VVilliams backs hurled themselves at the line but in vain. Union held firm and when the entire eleven gradually disentangled itself fro1n the heap, Draper was found with the ball tightly closed in his arms a full foot from the line. It was our ball on downs. The individual playing honors of the game easily fall to Captain Draper. His interference, his running with the ball, his defensive work were each brilliant and remarkable. The vvork of Graves, Chadwell, Hatch and Cullinane for Williams and of Finnegan, Shaw, Weed, Carver and Gordon for Union was especially meri- torious. On the whole, Union showed a splendid improvetnent over her previous form. Some twenty undergraduates went over to Willia1nstown with the eleven, and seven sub- stitutes were carried. Very good cheering was done by the fellows, and that it helped encourage the players a great deal, cannot be gainsaid. The treahnent of every one by the V\..-illiams students was fair and square. The summary follows. . Paige kicked to the five yard line. Draper caught and advanced to the thirty-five yard line. Williams kicked to Weed on Union's forty yard line who advanced ten yards. Carver kicked. It was Willia1ns' ball on her forty yard line. Union secured the ball on a ftunble. Carver kicked. O'Neill caught and advanced fifteen yards. At this point Draper went around the t·ight end for a touchdown. It. did not count however, for he had stepped out of bounds at the twenty-seven yard line. Draper went four yards through the line. Union got the ball on l1olding. Paige went five yards through center. He and Slack failed to make five yards and so Carver kicked. The ball was out of bounds. Williatns had it on our forty-five yard line. The ball went to the thirty-five yard line on offside play. Draper went round left end for seven- teen yards. O'Neill, Graves and Draper made five yards apiece and Graves was pushed over the line for a touchdown. Moore kicked goal. Score, Williams, 6; Union, o. Paige kicked fifty yards to Draper who carried the ball to the thirty yard line. O'Neill kicked. Weed caught and made twenty-five yards carry- ing the ball to the center of the field. Hard bucking by Slack, Gordon and Paige brought it quickly to the thirty yard line. Carver caught the ball high and lost it going through the bunch. A Willia1ns man promptly dropped on it. Graves made two pretty dives for five yards a piece, O'Neill went three yards through center, Graves added twelve yards by two plunges between right guard and tackle and Draper went around left end, bringing the ball up to Union's twenty yard line. Seven or eight . hard drives passed and Draper went over the line for a touchdown. Moore kicked goal. Score, Willian1s, I 2; Union, o. On the kick off Willia1ns advanced to the thirty yard line. A fun1ble gave the ball to Union. Paige bucked for five, Slack for three and Gordon for one yard. At this point Paige made his place kick and the score stood : Willia1ns, I 2 ; Union, 5. The half ended shortly. In the second half the Union man that caught was downed on the twenty yard line. Hard bucking carried the ball forward thirty yards when Willian1s held us on downs. Draper made seven yards and Union secured the pig- skin on a fumble. Williatns again held us for downs. The ball was on our forty yard line. The purple's backs bucked to the twenty-five yard line. Draper went around left end, and O'Neill bucked for a total gain of twenty-one yards. Williams tried to n1ake the required four yards but in vain, for the Union line stood firm and got the ball on downs. Carver kicked up the field and Dunning pro1nptly tackled his man on the thirty-five yard line. Williams made several slight gains and then received ten yards for offside play. O'Neill tried a drop kick but failed to come within fifteen yards of his mark. The ball was beyond bounds and

I5, and was well attended. After singing, and an opening prayer by Dr. Hoffman, President Raitt of the Y. M. C. A. introduced the speaker, the Rev. James D. Detnarest of the New Brun~wick Theological Seminary. The speaker chose as his subject Jeremiah, 5: r. He said in part: \A man is a rare being. The boy who says that he is going to be a man has the noblest ambition in life. There was more or less sense in the story of Diogenes who went through the streets of Athens looking for a man, and in the days of Jerenliah, Jerusalem lacked men that were men as much as did Athens. ''The divine idea of man is given in the scrip- tures. But the external surroundings of a man are often confounded with the true estimate of him. His social position makes a picture frame, as it were, to set off his advantages and to cover up his inner nature. ''The divine idea of a man is one who seeks the truth and does the right. Truth i& sur- rounded by a dense cloud of falsehood and a man must penetrate this mist of unbelief. The tnan who is honest with hin1self and God does not shirk from anything, but faces every moral question with manly courage. The spirit of Christ cleanses man from moral impurity and gives hitn a clearer conception of God. The honest man is reliable and is not vacillating in his ideas of moral right. It requires a true man to be honest against his own interests. Doing right is truth in action. The honest 1nan is kept in the steady course of consistent upright- ness. \ We need men in political circles like Clay, who said, ' I would rather be right than presi- dent.' We need men of unflinching courage like Luther, in the church. We need reliable and honest tnen in business. \ Be loyal to truth and duty. Trust in God and do right even though some will scoff and ridicule you.\

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS: $2.00 per Year, in Advance 10 Cents Address all communications to THE 'CONCORDI- ENSIS, Box 213, Schenectady, N. Y. Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Cbas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THE NECESSITY of having a large delegation of Union men at the R. P. I. game at Albany on Saturday must be apparent to all. A comparison of scores is evidence in itself that there must be no lack of cheering on that occasion if we expect to win. Regular leaders for rooting are all very well in their place, but without a crowd to make some noise, the purpose for which the leaders were appointed will hardly be carried out. Let every man feel it his duty to go to Albany Saturday and cheer the teatn on to victory. TEE CoNCORDIENSIS wishes it distinctly under- derstood that it is strictly unpartisan. In fact, we cannot remember when this publication has ever had occasion to refer to politics in any way. But in the present instance it has been thrust upon us. Since the metnorable night when the local ward nmninations were made, there has been a continuous :flood of campaign literature pouring in upon us. Columns of matter have had to be rejected for lack of space, and it is only at the urgent request of the managers of one candidate that we print a bit of verse on another page. Desiring to get the gent1e1nan's views on the questions of the day, a reporter was sent to call, but the nominee absolutely refused to be interviewed and all the information we were able to obtain was that volunteered by the office boy, to the effect that \dere was tree oder gents inside and de boss was makin figgers on d' blackboard, t' explain how he'd git elected.\ LAST week we gave full particulars regarding a series of Saturday morning lectures which are open to the public. The subjects offered include Medireval History, Rhetoric and Style, Life and Monuments of Antiquity, Greek· Literature, and Life and Evolution of Living Forms. The methods employed will correspond very closely to those used in the University Extension lecture systetn. The formal lecture will be followed by open and informal discussion. Likewise, collateral read- ings will be required and a formal examination will be given to those who request it. A certificate of work done will be issued to those who follow a course of lectures and succeed in passing the final test. This action of the college authorities is highly comtnendable. It is distinctly a step in advance and deserves the patronage of the townspeople and the support of the whole college body. The time is past when the college and the university should be regarded as close corporations reserving their intellectual wares for the select few who have the good fortune to be associated with them as students. The college that does not extend its influence beyond its immediate bounds will be left behind by progressive institutions of learning. The college of today must do intellectual missionary work. University Extension lectures afford it an excellent opportunity to train secondary teachers in better educational n1ethods. The college will reap the reward, for better secondary work means better preparation for college.

TiiE OONOORDIENSIS. ii Fotunately, there is little necessity in this coun- try for sounding a note of warning to those who take University Extension lecbtres. But in all popular courses of this kind, there lurks a positive danger. It is, that some who follow such courses of lectures may take themselves all too seriously. Some are apt to indulge the fancy that they are receiving the equivalent of even a part of a college training-or something just as good. To do this would be to cruelly deceive one's self and he who encouraged the thought would not be free from blame. In many cases it would be overlaying pro- vincial ignorance with a thin veneer of intellectual varnish that will soon rub off. There are some University Extension enthusiasts who are working the movement great injury by making high-sounding claims that gain nothing but a sneer from educated, though caustic people. The movement, as conceived at Union, is in no immediate danger of this fault. It can be made productive of increasingly good results. THE SOPHOMO:QE ELECTION. At a meeting of the class of 1902, held in the chapel last week, the following officers were elected for the ensuing year: President, Howard E. Sands, Jordan ; vice-president, Howard M. Parsons, Batavia; secretary, Arthur L. South, Bhchton ; treasurer, L. W. Bloch, Albany; assistant manager of The Concordiensis, to succeed to the management in his senior year, Robert B.

Hinman, Albany. New York University is building a magnificent new library on Univendty Heights at an expense of over $75o,ooo. ALDERMAN OPDYKE. Whom do we see upon the street, With head erect, apparel neat; Who is it profs. and students greet? Alderman Opdyke. Who '11 represent ward nu1nber one, And on the ticket straight will run? Hooray boys, there'll be lots of fun ! Alderman Opdyke. For whom will we all vote that can, As 'round the polls we take our stan' And stuff the ballots to a man? Alderman Opdyke. Who, through Old Dorp, will proudly strut, And such a dashing figure '11 cut? Who is our former tutor but Alderman Opdyke. Who'll put opponents, all, to rout? Why, \Oppy\ will without a doubt. That aldennanic figure stout, (Hats off I) is Aldern1an Opdyke. THE PSI U's ENTEQTAIN. The first college dance of the term was given by the Theta chapter of Psi Upsilon at its house on Friday evening, and a delightful affair it proved to be. The mild weather was propi- tious in that it allowed the dancers a cool retreat on the piazzas, and everything else combined to give all present a most enjoyable evening. Gioscia furnished the music and the refresh- ments were in charge of the fraternity chef. Those present were : Mrs. Price and the Misses Dora Yates, Susan Y ate~, Walker, Schoolcraft, Brown, Strain, Fuller, Kingsbury, Ostrom, Price, Lewis, Mabel Horsttnann, Maud Horstmann, Paige, Catnpbell, Clark, Horstmyre, Schuyler, Merriam, Whitlock, Button and Rankin; and Messrs.

12 TI!ln CONCORDiENSlS. SEMI-ANNUAL MEETING. Advisory Board of N. Y. S. I. A. U. in Session at Utica. The beseball pennant was not awarded. On actual games played the championship should be awarded ,to Hamilton. Union was unfortunate in having several games canceled, and if these are counted as defaults., Union would win by The semi-annual meeting of the advisory board of the New York State Intercollegiate Athletic Union was held Saturday, Oct. 7, at :Bagg's hotel, Utica. Professor Howard Opdyke of Union, the vice-president, was in the chair. Other members present were: J. D. Edwards, Union ; Professor W. R. Terrett and H. D. Spencer of Hamilton ; Professor M. S. Read and H. E. Fosdick of Colgate; and Willian1 J. Warren of Hobart. ' default. In actual contest against each other Hamilton and Hobart tied. Mr. Edwards was made secretary pro tern. Election of officers being in order, Professor Opdyke appointed as nominating committee Dr. Read, Colgate ; Dr. Terrett, Hamilton ; Mr. Warren, Hobart; and Mr. Edwards, Union. The officers selected were: President, W. E. Weed, Colgate; vice-president, Prof. Opdyke, Union; secretary, H. D. Spencer, Hamilton; treasurer, C. E. Franklin, Union; judicial committee, C. V. R. Johnson, Hobart; athletic committee, Professor Durfee, Professor Read, Messrs. Warren, Edwards, Spencer, Fosdick; financial committee, Professors Terrett, Opdyke, Durfee and Read. The report of Treasurer Franklin showed. the finances of the union to be in good condition. The receipts during the year were $rg6.o6. The proceeds of the field day at Schenectady in June were~$1 12.56. The assessments paid by the colleges bring the sum in the treasury up to $195 .o6. The expenditures amounted to $71 ·99, leaving a balance of $r 23.07. The report was accepted. Professor Read,f!Colgate, moved that the pro- ceeds of the field day, $112.56, be divided equally between Union and Hamilton colleges, as upon them were placed the responsibilities of the field day. Carried. Professor Read moved tlutt an assessment of $ro. 54 be levied upon each college in the union to defray the traveling expenses of the delegates to the four meetings of the advisory board com- mittee. Carried. Hobart was permitted to withdraw from the football championship this year. Hobart college desires to manage the next field day. It is recommended that if Hobart can conduct the games in Syracuse that it be done. At the meeting next spring the final decision on the baseball championship will be made, the place of holding the annual field meet will be decided upon and the neutral umpires will be determined. FOOTBALL AT OTHER COLLEGES. Last week's football games began to show up much more than before, the status and prospects of the season now in full blast. The men on the big 'varsities are now beginning to realize about how they stand and about what chance they are going to have in the big games which come so soon. Everything at present seems to point toward Harvard as having the crack eleven of the year, although Princeton seems likely to be able to contest that claim with a great deal of force. Harvard at present seems to be weak in but one spot, at her tackles. Princeton is rather weak at several positions. Harvard's good sized scores against both Amherst and West Point serve to decidedly more than balance the small scores that Princeton was able to make against Lafayette and Columbia. Columbia's line, especially, was able to accomplish a great deal in the way of repelling the Tigers' on- slaughts. Her half back's were often thrown back for a loss. Her defence was also weak. Harvard, on the contrary, has up to now shown a wonderful aggressiveness. At Yale a rapid itnprovetnent has been taking place. Hard, heavy work and scientific coach- ing is doing a great deal toward building up a much better eleven than has been expected.

THE C'ONCORDtENSIEt iS ••• ,'I.. ......... . She has been unfortunate in having several mea crippled. Although she ran up but twelve points against Dartmouth, it must be cons~idered that the latter eleven put up one of the pluckiest games of the season. PenHsylvania's work has been a keen disap- pointment to her admirers. The Carlisle Indians on Saturday, gave her one of the hardest drub- bings she has ever had. Poor interference, lack of aggressive team play and of compact defence are her weak points. Ginger in her play is badly needed and unless it comes quickly, she may have some deeper mortifications. Cornell and West Point as well are not show- ing up at aU in a good manner. West Point:s great game at Philadelphia next month ts extremely liable to be lost to the naval cadets unless a marked improvement is made in her present form. One of the best of the second class elevens this year is that of Brown. Her work thus far has been more than satisfactory. Hamilton's defeat of R. P. I. on Saturday by a score of twenty to seventeen will help Union after this Saturday to understand pretty thoro- ughly what she may expect when the Clinton team comas to Schenectady. Our defeat at the hands of R. P. I. two weeks ago can be no sufficient comparison. The steady handling of the ball in the Williams game and the frequent fumbling by both sides in the R. P. I.-Hamilton game would at least tend to show that the Dorpian men have undergone a much greater improvement than have the representatives of the Troy institute. However, it is never safe to prophesy in football, so let us await the results, and in the meantime keep up the good work of the past. William G. Hartin, r9o3, was absent from college a few days, suffering from a slight attack of the grip. LeRoy 0. Ripley, 1900, left Monday night for Gettysburg, Pa., where he will attend the annual convention of the Alpha Province of Phi Delta Theta, which will be held at Gettysburg College, October r8, r 9 and 20.

EDWIN MARKHAM'S POEM, \The Muse of Brotherhood.\ Mr. Markham's most recent poem, \The Muse of Brotherhood,\ is one of the few really \ great poems that the closing years of the century have produced. In it Mr. Markham voices a lofty optimism that is at once more impressive and 1nore convincing than the notes of hopeles-s- ness and despair that characterize ''The Man with the Hoe.\ At the same time he nobly sets forth the principles of that universal brotherhood which says: \My love is higher than heavens where Taurus wheels, My love is deeper than the pillared skies : High as that peak in Heaven where Milton kneels, Deep as that grave in Hell where Cresar lies.\ The muse of Brotherhood will appear ex- clusively in The Saturday Evening Post, of Philadelphia, in its issue of October 21.

COLLEGE MUSICIANS' SUMME~ T~IP. Almost every summer of late years some of the tnembers of the college musical clubs have spent their vacations in trips to the various summer resorts giving concerts, and last sum- mer was no exception. Greene, '99, Barrett, rgor, Gutmann, (Med.) 1902, Eames, '99 and Heermance, [901, pianist and humorist, com- posed the troupe. The first concert was given Monday, August • 7, at the Marion, on Lake George, and a pleas- ing entertainment was given to a large audience. An equally successful concert was given at the Sagamore, Tuesday evening and was followed by one Wednesday at Hulett's Landing and another Thursday at the Hague. The quartette left for Ralph's Hotel on upper Chateaugay Lake where they remained until Saturday, Aug. r 9· On Monday the concert was given and on Tuesday an infonnal entertainment. Thursday, in connection with local talent, a minstrel show was given and on Friday they enjoyed a german given in their honor. On Saturday they reluc- tantly left tlie gaiety of Ralph's and went to Childwold, where on Monday they gave the concert. At Dr. Trudeau's sanitariun1 at Sara- nac Lake a free concert was given in the after- noon and in the evening the last concert was given in the Algo~quin. The trip was an extremely pleasant one and large audiences were entertained all along the route. 15 ENGLEMAN & BELLINGE'R l>E-4-LERSIN Paints of Every Description.

®NG<DRDIBNSIS. No. 5. VoL. XXIII. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 25, 1899. FOOTBALL. UNION SCOI{ES ITS FIRST VICTORY. R. P. I. DEFEATED AT ALBANY BY A. SCORE OF 6 TO 0. Union was victorious over Rensselaer Poly- technic Institute on Saturday by a score of six to nothing. Fifteen seconds more and the reversal of a disputed decision would have increased it by at least ten points. The gatne was exciting, hard fought and full of surprises, and every one in the small Albany cro·wd that attended the struggle felt an1ply repaid for his admission fee. But a stnall nutnber of Union students went over to Ridgefield and the cheer- ing they did on the sidelines was necessarily below the average. R. P. I., on the con- trary, brought ov-er with her frotn Troy a large, enthusiastic delegation of undergraduates, who cheered on in the very face of defeat. . suporters of the team along the ropes that the ends should have been played tnore, still it was recognized that the eleven was playing under the coach's orders. Bryan, the big end from the Law School, played easily the most brilliant game of the.day. He broke through. the line at will and was always to be found at the right spot at the right tnotnent. Carver, at right end, proved a tower of strength. He broke up the interference well. Paige hit the line in beautiful shape. On the second kick off, l1is gain of forty-five yards through the R. P. I. center vvas the prettiest run of the day. R. P. I's work was clever throughout although it lacked steadiness at critical points of the gatne. Fun1bling was, perhaps, the greatest defect in her play. Gridley, her big center, played a very strong game. Doty, at right half, made two pretty runs around Union's right tackle. He followed his interference well and shook off tacklers with a great deal of cleverness. Everything was propitious for a good football game. The chilly air, the strong condition of each eieven, and Union's defeat of three weeks ago,-all served to lend additional interest to the afternoon's sport. Union rather anticipated winning, yet the Polytechnic's good showing of the past two weeks indicated that she would at any account be a strong factor in the game. The playing of Union's eleven was a great improvement over the early part of the season. The fellows went into the game in the very best condition and were anxious to play fast ball. But R. P. I's physical condition was very weak, some of her teatn being laid out at the end of nearly every down. These titne-killing tactics prolonged the two twenty tninute halves fron1 ten tninutes past three until a quarter to five. Union's tactics in the entire game were straight ahead line bucking and though it &eemed to the Union scored her six points within the first three minutes of play. R. P. I. fumbled on the kick off and gave Union the ball well within the former's territory. Hard line bucking quickly carried the ball over for a touchdown. Not long after, Weed scored what appeared to everyone to be another touchdown. Carver kicked up the field and the ball rolled over the line. While the R. P. I.· man was thinking over the advisability of dropping on the ball, Carver ran for\vard over the line past the ball. This put it on side and made it anyone's ball. Wee(l, \Vho stood ready to tackle his man, saw this and quickly dropped on the pigskin. Referee Davis would not allow a touchdown, however, and gave the ball to R. P. I. to kick at the twenty-five yard line. R. P. I. twice catne near scoring in this half by long runs of Doty. He brougl1t it to the twenty yard line once and to the ten yard line another time but

·~ 6 THE OONCORDIENSIS. in vain, for each titne on the very next play Union secured the leather on a futnble. The struggling in the second half was tnainly in the Polytechnic's territory. \' time was called, the ball was being advanced five or six yards on every down and 9ne more line up would undoubtedly have carried it over the line. The play in detail follows : Paige kicked off. The ball bounded high, the R. P. I. man fumbled, and Bryan dropped on it at R. P. I's thirty-two yard line. Union started in pounding the line. Slack made three yards; Gordon, six; Paige, seven; Carver, three ; Gordon, one ; Paige, two ; Gordon, three ; Paige, two ; Carver, three ; and then Gordon was pushed over for a touchdown. Paige kicked goal. Score, Union, 6; R. P. I., o. Ward kicked off to Paige on the ten yard line and the latter, with Bryan in the lead, dashed through the R. P. I. line, eluding everyone but Judd, the plucky little quarter back, who downed hitn at the center of the field. Gains by Slack and Paige carried the ball five yards further when R. P. I. made a plucky stand and held the Garnet on downs. Ward made three yards through center and Doty plunged for three more. Pickering was sent around left tackle for seven yards and Doty around left end for five more. Here Bryan broke through the line and tackled Ward five yards back. Union stood £rn1 and held the Trojans on downs. At Union's fifty yard line Slack, Paige and Gordon plunged for a total gain of sixteen yards and Union was given ten in addition for offside play. Paige and Gordon made slight gains but Doty broke through and tackled Slack in his tracks. Union was forced to kick and Carver punted ovet the line. Here the play previously mentioned occurred. Weed fell on the ball over the line. It was brought out to the twenty-five yard line and kicked by Ward to Slack on Union's forty-five yard line. R. p·, I. secured the pigskin on a futnble. Just here Doty made his first sensational run outside of Union's right tackle. Slack failed to get his man though Carver broke up the interference. Weed tackled but Doty shook him off and dashed to the twenty yard line where Paige stopped hitn. Ward fumbled on the next play and Fenton fell on the ball. Paige by two- plunges carried it to the thirty-five yard line. The close formation was worked with a loss and R. P. I. secured it on a fumble. This did them no good for another fumble gave it back to Union. Slack and Gordon advanced to Union's forty-five yard line and Carver kicked out of bounds. R. P. I. had the ball on her fifty yard line. Doty tnade another pretty run through the same place as before, dodging Slack, shaking ofl' Weed's and Gordon's tackles and not be~g downed until he reached the ten yard line. The Polytechnic tnen were to anxious, however, and Union received the ball for holding. Paige and Gordon plunged for a gain of fifteen yards, but R. P. I. again secured the leather on a for- ward pass from Paige to Weed. An attempt at ktcking a goal frotn the field was nicely stopped by Bryan's breaking through the line and stopping the b!lll. Carver fell on the ball and titne was called. Throughout the second half, R. P. I. did all that was possible to delay the garne. Tin1e was frequently called for, and the fulllitnit used up. Burgoyne kicked to Carver who advanced to the thirty yard line. R. P. I. held finn and Carver had to kick. Judd caught on the Polytechnic's forty-five yard line and was tackled hard by Thebo. Two other Union men fell on him at the same titne, and though injured he plucki~y tried to go on with the game, but the strain was too much, Ward taking his place and Moore being put in at left half. Pickering made five yards round right end and the game was stopped long enough to put a rubber bandage on Paige's knee. Moore, Doty and Bagley made three pretty runs, carrying the ball up to the twenty yard line where Union regained possession of it on holding. Carver kicked down the field and Steele caught. Doty made ten yards throught the line and Bagley added ten more. Thebo stnashed in quickly and downed Moore with a loss of ten yards. Burgoyne kicked up the field thirty yards to Weed who was downed in his tracks. Gordon made five yards on a cross tackle play 1 '.

Carver punted and Union shortly received the baH on downs at her thirty-five yard line. With scarcely a minute left; Union mowed down her opponents on every play despite desperate resistance. Paige and Gordon bucked in beautiful style through large gaps made for the1n ·in the line and brought the ball up to the three yard line.

g· THE OONCO·RDIENSlS. JUNIORS AND FQESHMEN TIE. An intet·class football .game between 1901 and 1903 took place on the can1pus Thursday after- ternoon before the 'varsity practice. The juniors kicked off and the freshmen seemed at first to have a little the best of things and rapidly advanced the ball. Then there was a futnble and Macfarlane, 1903, picked up the ball and with a .good start he ran half the length of the field for a touchdown. The freshtnen failed to kick the goal, and the half ended with no furtl!er scoring. In the second half the juniors steadily -moved the ball up the field and by repeated line buck- ing bCOred a touchdown just before time was called. No goal. There was a. large crowd of students and several alutnni present and excitement ran high. The line up: 1901. 1903. Kline ................ left end .............

A New Constitution for the N. Y. State Press Association. During the latter part of th~ college year of 1898-9, the cotnmittee of the N e\v York State Intercollegiate Press Association, appointed at a previous meeting to revise the constitution, presented the following report ·which is printed in full. The vote of The Concordiensis was in favor of the adoption of the proposed constitu- tion. Elmin1;;, College, Eln1ira, N. Y. To the New York State Intercollegiate Press Association. We, the undersigned committee appointed to revise your constitution, respectfully subtnit the following report : While there seems little reasonable doubt that there is a place in New York State intercollegiate journalism for an association which shall both forward the general work of the college press and increase the efficiency of individual papers, it has long been recognized that under the existing constitution the association is all but a tneaningle5s and useless organization. It has been deen1ed wise therefore so to retnodel the constitution as to place the association in a posi- tion where practical results may be obtained. The cotnmittee desires, in presenting the a mended constitution, to call attention to the tnost radical point of departure frotn the original plan of the association's founders, namely, the abolishment of the November meetings. In the past, in spite of earnest and arduous labor to make the annual conventions a success, they have in no case been representative of any con- siderable nutnber of the association's tnembers, and have signally failed to benefit in any n1arked way the cause of college journalism. We believe that by doing away with a convocation which always involves large expenditure of time, energy and money, and by simplifying the mechanism of the association as tnuch as possible, we have laid a foundation on which an association may exist, which, while not ideal, will at least be - ·\ j ~f ·.\ .I I 4 ·.

We, therefore, beg to subtnit for your consider- ation the following constitution on which you are requested to ballot \yes\ or \no\ con- cerning each individual article.

THE MATTER of football subscriptions is one of paratnount importance, and calls for the immediate attention of every man in college. The athlettc board has given out an ultimatum, and there must be $200 in their hands by Friday. The board reports that the class collectors are very slow to pay in the subscriptions but the blame is not entirely with the latter. The individual students who have not yet settled this obligation should make it their business to do so at once. THE FOLLOWING editorial from ''The Brown and White\ is perhaps not out of place in this column. At Union it applies not so much to the freshmen who seem to have a due regard for the classes above them, as to the sophomores and juniors who invariably are the first, or among the first out of chapel in the morning. ''There is one custom at Lehigh to which it always appears necessary to call the attention of the members of the incoming class, and yet this should not be so, for a little observation on their part would obviate it-we refer to the manner in which the several classes leave the chapel at the conclusion of morning prayers. The seniors invari- ably go out first, the others remain seated until the former have left; then the juniors go out; then the sophomor~s; and last of all, the freshmen. This is one of the oldest unwritten rules at Lehigh, and an entirely proper one, for in its observance, the lower class shows but a proper amount of respect for the next one above. We hope this will be sufficient to prevent any further breach of col- lege etiquette in this direction.'' AMONG the many undergraduate organizations none is more deserving of support than the tnusical association. Just at present there are two ways in which this support may be given. In the first place a nominal per capita assessment has been levied upon the student body to start the organiza- tion on a firm financial footing : everyone should make it his duty to see that this obligation is can- celled. But there is another way of supporting the clubs, and this applies to the men in college who have any ability in music, either vocal or instrumental. The keener the competition for positions, the better will be the clubs, and you who have any musical ability owe it to yourselves as well as the college to get out and try for places. The advantages to the college through its musical clubs, and to the students fortunate enough to \make\ them, are too generally recognized to be enlarged upon here. Suffice it to say that there is no other student enterprise which better keeps a college before the world, and no other branch of undergraduate life which offers more actual bene- fits than does this. The glee, banjo, mandolin and guitar clubs have all begun work for the season of 1899-1900, but in no case has the personnel of the clubs been definitely decided upon. So it is not yet too late. Let the number of candidates be doubled. -

TilE OO:NCORDIENSIS. it A SILENT' VlSITO:Q. Beneath a shady elm Dne stuntner 's day, I lay me down to rest, Beside the sounding brook's entranoing play, A blessing of the blest. And as I hmnage gave to reverie's muse, A visitor appeared, And sought repose nearby, free from the foes , Of joy-morose and weird. She was a silent visitor, and yet Her tasteful dress did shine With beauty rare, and like a jewel ~et­ The choicest of the ,mine. I thought me of the silence she maintained, Despite the joy possessed Of beauty. And are mortals so inclined,- Silent, with beauty blest? Nay, 'tis too true that vanity's fair shrine Is sought by steady ft anks Of worshippers, who tbink to far outshine Their neighbors in the ranks. I looked to my fair visitor to see If I were yet alone; But on a breeze that waved the old elm tree, The butterfly was g-one. JOHN MCNAB, 1901. FRA TERNIT'Y INITIATES.

While on the return voyage on the stean1ship Servia he tnet with an accident, breaking his wrist and sustaining serious injuries to bis hip. He is now confined in the Brooklyn hospital. '69.-The Concordiensis regrets to record the death of Hon. Williatn Howes Smith, which occurred at his. residence in this city. The deceased was born in Schenectady and was a man of n1iddle life. He was the son of Abel Stnith, who was mayot· of the city in 1855-56. 'VVhen a youth he attended the city schools and later becan1e a member of the class of 1869 at Union, where he was prominently identified with undergraduate enterptises and was a mem her of the Delta Phi fraternity. In 1872, he entered the office of Alexander J. Thotnson, '48, as a law student. He continued his studies for two years when he abandoned them and entered the hardware business with his father. After his father's death he con- tinued the business for several years and then entered the office of the Schenecbidy Locotnotive Works, where his business abilities and integ· rity were at once appreciated and he was soon placed in charge of the purchasing department. He held that position of trust and responsibility to the present day. 'l\he deceased was always a democrat and has held the chief positions of honor and trust within the gift of his fellow townstnen. In r875 he was chosen recorder and. in r 877, he was elected tna yor and continued as such for two years. At the expiration of his tenn as mayor he was elected a tnetnber of the con'ltnon council for the period oi three years. Mr. Smith then retired frotn active participa- tion in . tn unici pal affairs until Oct. I, 1888, when he was appointed a rnember of the board of education and :shortly afte.rwat~s was elected president and continued in that capacity until his failing health ,compelled him to resign in October, 1898. As an educator he was prominently influential in eve!ything pertaining to advancement and in1provement of the city S'chools and procured the necessary legislation for the erection of the new buildings. It He was appointed a water commissioner in 1889 and resigned in 1891. During that thne - the first efforts toward the new and improved water supply for the city were n1ade. He was very prominent in J\tl asonic orders. On Decetnber Io, 1874, he was niade a men1ber of St. George's Lodge, No. 6, F. and A. M., and a member of St. George's Chapter, No. 157, R. A.M., March 4, 1875. On November 15, 1875, he was made a tnetnber of St. George's Commandery, No. 37, Knights Templar. He is also a 30th degree Scot6sh Rite Mason. He was master of St. George's 1odge in the years r895 and 1896, and also a men1ber of the grand lodge. As master he was most successful. During his adtninistration the temple was remodeled and repaired, and every debt cleared away. Mr. Smith is survived by his widow, formerly Miss Alice Butler of Colurnbia, 0., one son, Abel Stnith, '98, and a daughter. '91.-J ames W.

., THE OONOORDIENSIS. i3 THE COLLEGE Y. M. C. A. Importance of the Tuesday Evening Meetings. The regular weekly meeting of the college Y. M. C. A. has been called the focal point of its work. Such it is; and we take this means of bringing it before the attention of the student body. In our college, the devotional n1eeting is held every Tuesday evening frorn 7 :r5 to 8. · It is the sincere desire of the officers of the associ- ation that all the rnen in college should attend these meetings. The time taken is very short, only three quarters of an hour. The meetings are begttn pr9mptly and closed on time. The principle is followed out that it were better that all present should leave \\Vith a good irnpression than that one should go away dissatisfied. T'he topics discussed are bright and practical. The leader's remarks are brief and interesting. He does not take up all the tin1e but rathet· suggests lines of thought, so that each one sees sotne new phase of the subject. The aim, above all things else, is to nutke the tneeting as spiritual as possi- ble. No argutnent is needed to show that this n1eeting is one that should receive the attention of the college tnen. It is altnost the only one which brings the tnen together, where all feel free and equal, and where there is no factional eletnent. A man owes it as a duty to h it-nself, as well as to his Maker, to develop the spiritual side of his nature as well as the intellectual and physical. The devotionalt-neeting of the associ- ation offers him a chance for such development. And a tnan cannot graduate fl·otn college today and call hirnself educa~ed unless he is so deYeloped. LITERARY NOTE. The College Man's Number of The Saturday Evening Post (of Philadelphia) though planned prilnarily to appeal to university men, past and present, will interest all who care for the short story at its best. Robert W. Chatnhet·s, in \The Spirit of the North,\ tells of the adven- tures of a party of Columbia naturalists and their quest of the dingue-hitherto supposed to be extinct-in the unknown country behind the Hudson Mountains. This story is a rather remadcable combination of exciting action and inimitable hurnor. Charles Macomb Flandrau (author of Harvard Episodes) contributes \Prince Protococoff and the Pre.ss Club,\ an frresistibly funny episode of Cambridge life. Jesse Lynch Williams (author of Princeton Stories and The Stolen Story) chronicles ''The Great College-Circus Fight\ between Princeton students and a passing Wild-West Show; and Arthur Hobson Quinn (author of Pennsylvania Stories) tells the story of \The Last Five Yards.\ Arnong other contributors to the number are President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who discusses the regulation of college athletics ; Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who describes the college life of our grandfathers, and President Nathaniel Butler, of Colby College. The College Man's Number will be on all news-stands October 26. RESOLUTIONS OF RESPECT. At a special meeting of the Alpha Chapter of the Delta Phi Fraternity, held October 14, 1899, the following preatnble and resolutions . were adopted : . . Whereas, It has pleased Almtghty God 111 His Providence, to retnove our beloved brother, William Howes Smith from among us; be it Re.solved, That while we sytn pathize n1ost deeply and sincerely with his family in their great affliction, we tnourn the loss of a brother who has endeared himself to every member of the Fraternity, by his sterling qualities and unswerving fidelity. , Resolved, That the 1nembers of the Alpha Chapter wear the usual badge of .. m?urning for thirty days as a mark of respect to hts memory. Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be · forwarded to his family, to the Associate Chap- ters of the Fraternity, and that they be published in the college and city papers. HowARD P.

14 THE CONCOR1J!ENS!S. PQESIDE:NT MAC KENZIE OF ELMIQA COLLEGE SPEAKS. The usual Y. M. C. A. service was held in the chapel Sunday afternoon an<;l a fair number of students were present. President Rayrnond, after offering the opening prayer introduced the speaker the Rev. Dr. MacKenzie, president of Eltnira Female College. Dr. ·MacKenzie read the thirty-second psalm, and proceeded to draw the following lessons from it: \ The young man of today who knows noth- ing of the scdptures is not fitted for the com- merce of the world; he is not able to grapple with the leading questions of the day. \ The wt·iter of this psalm had Christianity in his heart and he gives the true Christian spirit in his words. This beautiful psalm takes us through all the stages of religious experience. First there is the gladness of a soul whose heart is conscious of forgivenness of sin. Then the soul in distress, the confession of sin, the con- sciousness of forgivenness, the state of prayer which is the secret of a pure and noble life, the protecting power of a God of love, the religious instruction which God gives us so that we can better appreciate worldly learning. Next in order come exhortation, trust in God, and lastly, rejoicing in the Lord's goodness.\ In conclusion Dr. MacKenzie said. that we do not get influence by gaining place but by grasp- ing the underlying principles of truth. This is what elevates 1nan, causes his fellows to bow down and respect him, and lifts him to a higher plane. CAMPUS CHAT. A Variety of Topics Picked Up Here and There.
