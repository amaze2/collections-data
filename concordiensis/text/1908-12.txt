CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXII. UNION COLLEGE, DECEl\IIBER 14, 1908 No.8 MANLINESS lN COLLEGE. Manliness! \.Vhat is the image presented to your mind's eye at the m·cntion of this word? To wh.at type of student do you think this word best applies? To the plugger, to the athlete, to the Christian Association man or to a com.posite of all these? You must hav·e some idea of manliness an.d the color of that idea will depend up-on the amo-unt or the virtue you yourself pos;sess. Here are a few snapshots of men whom some would consider rn.anly: Out o-n the footbaH field there is a man who is playing a star game. Word is passed a1ong among his opponents that he must be laid out. In the next scrimmage the work Ls d·one and the game saved-for his. op.ponents. Manly was it? NQ. Saved the college an overwhelming defeat. · T·he subject for the big Jebate has bee·n an- nounced. The captain of the home team secu~es from th'e State Libra.ry all the valuable and avail- able material for both sides. The home tea1n wins. The name of the college is again saved. Examinations draw near and you have been loafi'ng. You know you can not pass· the-m unaided, so you spe·nd the evening befo-re each examina· tion carefuJly preparing some form -of a \trot.'' You have a perfect right to use this, you say, for the profess.or does not require that you give your word that you have receiv-ed no help during the. examination. Furthermore other fellows d-o it. Why should not you. also? There are a thousand reasons why you should not. In the time that it took you to prepare that trot you coul-d absorb enough of the subject to pas,:, it up, thus retaining your honor, sa.ving your- self the sneaky feeling that comes to a man {)f conscience when he cheats, and indire·ctly render- ing your college .a service by the bit of inflm:mce for manliness that you would thus exert. Here's a picture with a different tone. The big track meet at the time of th·e two-mile run. One of the two men on the home team is the star run- ner of tte college; the other a rres11man. who has trained steadily for months because some o-f his classn1ates jokingly told hin1 he was a wonder. In the last half mile the opponents are left behind and the two home men, the crack runner and the gre·enhorn have the race easily. As the two near the tape. the crack runner st·owly falls hack and gasps to L.1e greenhorn to make it-or die. He co1nes in second, not much the worse for his run. That act of se1t:-sacrifice exhibi-ts manliness of the highest type-the type that would keep his mouth shut and let the other fellow enjoy his hono-r undimmed. Our college is entering upon a new era. There are 1nany indications of this. A new type of alumni is growing up-men that have the best in- terests of the college at heart. We have the largest fresh1nan class in the history of the in- stituti-on, the largest number of students in at- tendance since 1862. We have a Press Club whose plans, if successfully carried out, will make the name of Union College well kn-own in every part of our c-ountry. Debating i_s demanding more at~ tention from the students and has been placed on a sound basis. The most important step of all has not been taken as yet, the step ta.ward a new stan.Jard of honor for the classroom. The truly successful college is not the one th~lt has the largest student body, the most costly and n1o-dern buildings, the cra:ck athletic teams, the most aristocratic fraternities and club.s. It is the college that deV\3lope.s the highest type of man- hood. Unless a college sends forth ea-ch year me·n that are endowed above all else with the noblest and manliest princ-iples of life, it has utterly failed in itB purpose. ,. Furthermore it is our duty to our parents and

If -we f:ail in any o'II.e of ·these qualities we are not vv0rthy to be sons of Olid Union. w·e are a disgrace to our fathers an.d :rn:others and are not Hving lives that are true, honest, rn.anly.

In that lana of silent shadows, Where the twilight reigns supreme, WASHBURN-POWERS BUILDING {RED BUILDING) Where melancholy wat~rs Lie in sli>lent, eternal r•est. Unearthly land of peaceful winds Where shall I find my rest? S·hall it be in thaiC dim la.nd, Far out in the silent west? S·hall ther~ be a mystic mo·on To shine on this silvery shore, When my soul caught by death's great wave t Will view life's tides no :m-ore? And the sil'ant night lasts ever In that v<>id of peaee serene. Far beyo·nd the farthest planet, T'hr<lug'll the void of da.rkest night, Whe:1';e never ,t lon!a sitar whirls, Or a coneot takes 'its flight. In this ghastly lurid sky, Of tb:e ·&reams of a living night, There lies a. land of unbroken rest. The land o-f the silent night. H. T. C., 1912 ) ; J :1 ., l ~ I. ' l i

As s~oon as' I was absent in .spirit fr·o1n this te r- restrial globe I l€t my mind, too, gJ on a menta: trip across the River .Styx to Pluto;s glomny realms, t1:1,e abode of the alu,des b•Elow. T!1e f.aculty of Old ·union were all with me .on my trip, so I was at Jnce in a d~·cldedly classic, uiterary and scientific atmosphere, as you will .:;ee from what transtpired. We all ente-red the boat of that \griln f2rry- n1an, Charon, whon1 poets write of,\ and were soon being wafted over the 1nurky stream. Ashey was the fir.st to break t:w n1onotony by n1umbling somethin~g about the .steam pipes or old Oharnu's s-kiff, and d 1 E'ol~arin.g' that if tning;:; weren't warmer on the other s~~e -:1.e would filhi ·Out what was the matter.

Buttriclt, y-ou may be sure, wa.s right on hand, a:nd charged old Ghar·on eight dollars as an inci- dental fee for running bis O'Wn boat. The poor ferryman thought such a course was a very strange procedure; but, of cnurs·c, fie paid. At this juncture the wind subsid·cd and the boat came to a standstill. A happy plan was hit upon. Mi·eky Ann was colnmiBsioned to su~pply ·'not air,'' and so great was his ability along this line that a gond :breeze was soon stirred up, and the boat again sped on. Oppie and Gary h-ad become very exc.ltcd over a heated discussion about the laws of the curve, so Oppie began to give his comrades a very lueid explanation nf the mathematics of the whole mat- ter.

From his earliest years he has b€en first among his ass·o- ciatcs. They have delighted to honor him. It has been their pleasure to place him a:t their head to s:hine in th.e s·cintiila Nons of his wit or to~ ba.s,k in th.e more steady effulgence of h-is weightier tal· cnts, and while they have thus admired and up- held him, they have p·rophesied for hhn an en- viable .future and a brilliant success. Ambition fills his soul with thoughts of achieve- ments. Hope a:nimates his h·eart with lofty dreams. Zeal strengthens his sinews to over com 2 every obstacle, and his whole being exults at the thought that he has the broad world for an arena. Years pass and our eager young dreamer is 3. disappointed man. His mind, o:uce like a moun- tain torre·nt, sparkling and rushing over its rocky bed, has become a stagnant p-o-ol on the .distant plain, ha.s lost its br.ight, glittering gems of in- tellect and b~come dormant and inactive. His ex- pt:·etations are blasted, his ambition is a cruel, haunting ghost. He has spe·nt his life in climb- ing a hill of sand, daily -climbing yet not advanc- ing. Th,e m·en on who·m he relied, like the sand, have left him without a :fi·rm foundation. His plans have faih::~d, bhe possibilities he gras,ped, w11en barely touche-d, have crumbled into atoms. Now with ambitiun lo<St, with hopes crushed and with expectations vanished, he sits in the grave- like hollow he has dug for himself, lost to the sight ·of th'e world, awaiting his doom. The scene i.s s.atl, yet all around us dwell such men. When we see them we sometimes pity and oftener chide. We recall what t:tey pro,mised to bt. We think of what they are; while o1u lips m·ould the single Vv ord-unsuccess:ful. There are othe·rs whom the world count as fa.il- ures. Men who take th'e lead in the world's great issues. Me·n who give their whole lives to re- form humanity-. They are called unsuecessful. They are unappreciated, b'ccause they are far in advance of their age, because their efforts and

Finally the Chairman recognized an old min- ister who said, \Brethren I hab reaJ the scrip- ters considerably and while I confess I hab to der of business was the discus.sion of the fa.ct presented by Mr. J·ones on the preceding day. Mr. Jones arose and said: \Brethren as I said yisterday I am a stawjent an.d ha.ve discove!red co:ncll:tsive evidenee of my 'stounding fact, but I prefer not to Btate my evidence until the other gentlemen state their grounds for disbelieving my 'ser.tion. Let the opposition propound its case.\ The propos1tion was accepted anJ the propound- ing pegan. Arguments of all kinds were set florth to disprove Brother Jones' statement. Finally the oppositi-on exhausted itself an.d Mr. Jones's turn ca.me. His case looked dark. Not one of the brethren had spoken on hlis side and all semed against him. But he was not distur.bed. He arose with the sub· lilne assurance of a freshman who was valedic· torian of a class of six in the prep school and calmly said: \The argerments presented by n1y able brethren are magnificent for men not versed i'n the holy word of God. Before I became a stew- jent I would have been deceive·d by them, but I will not deta.in the conference,. sah, to reply to thesa lofty flights of arge:rmentive eloquence. I jest wa:!lt you to turn, s-ah, to the words of our little Master, found in the last verse of the last chapter of Matthew. Just hear this, gentlemen: \Lo (low) I am with you always, even unto the skip the big wuild;S I hab neve·r seen any such end or th\~ world.H statament in the holy writ. I move sah, that the \T'hat settles the matter. Christ hisself says eha.ir appint a time fo·r the considHrart:~ion of this 'stonishing fact and th.at we hear the a.rguments on both sides.\ The motion wa.s carried and the chair an- .. nounced that the matter would be taken up for discussion the next morning at 10 o'clock. The routin·c business was dull and \he memberiS slip- ped out o·ne after an·other; before tne pl\'Ogram was finished only two or three were left.

• a,d- 01 me ith 1'HE CONCORDIENSIS FOBESTS. Tq the college man the subJect of forestry may seem unint~resting, and )71et the colle:g~ studf-m.t of to-day ought to be a leader in publie affairs to- morrow. And if he would be a lea.der ·fu.e m:ust be able to deal intelligently with the great problems of the na.tion, and surely there is no :probre.rn more acu.te a.t the present moment tHan the problem of our natural resources, of which forestry is a sub- I division. When the wooded areas of the country were E:O extensive as to hinder agriculture, no oae dreamed that the time would come when the U:ni-tecl States would face a timber fam-ine. Yet th.at time has come and has forced to tne front two other pro-b- lems-ero~ion and the control or the water_ sup- ply. In a heavily foreste.d district the interlacing crowns of the trees form a barrier against the heavy rains; then tn.e litter o£ leaves~ moss and Jecaying tree trunks, ever present in a forest, acts a.s a blanket, absorbing much moisture and. hold- ing it in reserve; finally, the fine hair-like root- let6 of the trees, w nich extend through.. the soil i.Ll all directions bind t11e soil partiere~ tvg\~ther. When the timber is removed the f.aH force of the storms beats down upon the unprotected soil; tne litter is soon washed away; the soH particles, having nothing to hold them together, are carried down the slope by the storm. The wateT, in turn., there being nothing to hold it bach:, q_uickly runs off. Thus erosion begins. At firs·t th.a :proce;:3s is slow, but soon the ground is furrowed with gul- lies and rendered quite unfit for cu,ltiv ation. Some idea of the damage due to erosion may be inferred from the fact that the Missisippi River annually deposits in the Gulf of Mexico as ·lll:Uch soil as was removed in the digging of the Fa.nama Canal last year. A large part of the soil so· deposited was carried down by the great floods from the deforested lands about tJhe headwaters of the lVllssissip·pi an l its tributaries. Among the causes of forest destru·ction, fire I holds .a high place. We think that a few thou- sand dollars' worth of damage by fire in one ()f our cities is worthy of mention; but how many -. the popular drug store At Quinn's You'll Find Dresser Furnishings for Him.

In addition to this amount $138,000 was expen~l·?<l in fighting the fires. In view of this destruction of the forests and in view of the many benefits which we derive from the forests, is it not almost obliga·tory upon every Am·ericau ·Citizen to further forest preser- vation to tlJ.e utmost of his power? 1soa UNION CALENDAR Now on Sale by H.
