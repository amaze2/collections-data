THE CONCORDIENSI.S .. ·. . - -. ~ UNION o:OLLE.GE, JANUARY 20, 19:04. No.l3. THE DREAMS OF MA:t--i. . (From The New York Times.) T'here are n1any gigantic schemes in the wor:ld to-day which are worthy and lineal suc- cessors of the plan for building the T o'wer of Babel. Yet in an age when so many won- ders have been accomplished it would be un- safe to assert that any of the v:ast products which. haunt the imagination of the advocates are impossible of accomplishment or to pro-' phesy for the1n the fate which overtook the tower building experiment on the plains of ..., Shinai\ Prench engineers have declared that it is perfectly feasible to convert the Desert of Sa- hara in to a vast lake, thus opening to com- merce great regions of the interior of Africa, which can now only be reached by long, tedious and dangerous caravan journeys. They say that a large proportion of the desert lies below the level of the Atlantic, and that by dtgging a canal to let in the waters of the ocean the great change could be effected easily and at a cost which would be small compared to the benefits which would accrue. If the whole desert lay below the level of the Atlantic the flooding of it would create a sea more than four tin1es as big as the J\1editerranean; but as the Sahara is co1nposed of elevated plateaus, mountain ranges and depressions, on;ly a part would be covered with water when the waves of the ocean vvere let in, and the new sea thus formed would be an irregular body of water probably of about the same size as the Medi- terranean. Great con1mercial cities would at . once spring up on its shores and trade and civilization strike at once to the heart of Af- rica. The Sea of Sahara n1ay never become a reality, but in any event it is a gigantic_ and pleasing dream. The Russians propose not to make a new sea but to improve an old 'One. The Sea of Azov, which lies back of the Crimea, is a body of water 2 20 miles long and eighty n1iles wide. It opens into the Baltic Sea, and would be an important centre of trade were it not for the fact that it is so extremely shallow that no ocean-going steamers can enter it. Even small boats have difficulty in navigating its waters. Now the Russian govern.ment proposes to bring wealth and business to the shores of the Sea of Azov by building a dam across the strait by which it communicates with the Black Sea of Azov, letting the rivers which empty into the shallow body of water fill it up to a depth which shall make it practicable for large steamers. It is thought that a heavy dam about two n1iles long, with a great lock capable of· taking in ocean steamers, \vould ac- complish the desired result. Where the shores of the'sea are high naturally they would be all right when the waters r0se, but where they are low artificial shores- would ·have tb- be con- structed, otherwise the Azov might only be increased in area instead of being deepened. It is a big undertaking, but the Russian gov- ernment is seriously considering the w·ork, and detailed plans have been prepared. Among great schemes may be included the proposition of Ron. Rollo Russell, a I\'Iember of the British Parlian1ent, who advocated the building of immense walls to increase the rain- fall in sterile districts. The walls were to be • so high that their tops would C!rrest the clouds and cause a downpour of rain, thereby render- ing fit for cultivation lands which are now good only for pasture or entirely unprofitable • Another member of the same family, Lord John Russell, when Pren1ier of England,- had urged upon his attention the scheme· of dig- ging an immense hole three miles in· cicuinfer-

It -was to give work to the unemployed and was to go down so deep that the subterranean heat released would be sufficient to furnish motive power for all the factories in the land. It has been proposed seriously several times ::to put out the fires of Vesuvius by letting in on them the \Yaters of the Mediterranean. The ·experiment has been prevented by fear that a gigantic explosion would result which would blow up Italy. THERAPEUTICS. II. A few instances of what Aesculapius could do in the old days will serve to illustrate the parallel between him and his successors. Inci- dentally they will also show that we have not in all respects surpassed the ancients. On the first of the two stele or slabs discovered at Epidaurus during the course of the excavations carried on frotn r 88 I to I 88 7 are recorded twenty cures; on the second, seventeen cures and parts of others. All these cures might be called extraordinary. So they are. Still, if we judge them by what the god could perform . ' we must subdivide then1 into cures ordinarily extraordinary and cures extraordinarily extra- ordinary. Case I 2, Stele I, is the case of Evippus. \ Evippus carried a spear-head in his jaw for six years. As he slept in the abaton, the god took out the spear-head and placed it in his hands. In the morning he crept out, cured, ·with the spear-head in his hands.\ This is a cure very ordinarily extraordinary. The god Aesculapius couid have cured you so, \ eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping hours '' not excepted. The meth- od of the cure, you will observe, was much like the one still employed by the miracle-working sainfs of Greece. Case I 8, Stele I, is less ordinarily extraordi- nary but not extraordinarily extraordinary. It 1s the case of Ale etas of Halyce. '' He was blind. He saw a v1s1on. He thought that the god ca,m.e to him, took hold of his eyelids and opened his eyes. He seemed for the first time to see the trees in the sanctuary. In the n1orning he went out cured.\ This is no everyday sort of cure. Still it is scarcely more re1narkable than Saiat Bar- bara's cure of a paralyzed hand; no more re- markable than her cure of the deaf and dun1b child. Of the extraordinarily extraordinary cures of Aesculapius, the masterpiece is twice won- derful. It is not merely miraculous; it is vi- carious as well. It is the case of Miss Good of Sparta. She had the dropsy. Being too ill to go to Epidaurus herself, her mother went for her, slept in the abaton and saw a vision. ''She thought that the god cut off her daugh- Q ter's head and hung up the' body neck down. After a great deal of water had run out, the god took down the body and put the head on the neck again. Having seen this vision, she returned to Sparta and learned that her daugh- ter had seen the same vision and was well.\ IviY LAST GAME I vvas not superstitious, not I! I had been told during my Summer vacation by an old gypsy fortune-teller to beware the 1nonth of November. I laughed at the time, but prom- ised her more silver if she would tell me what was to happen. She only shook her head and held up her skinny :finger in a gesture of warn- ing. It was an odd thing I thought that a gypsy woman should refuse sHver for an extra lie. November came and was approaching its end as I sat one day with 1ny feet on ·my study table which had been dra\vn up close to the fite-place in which I had built a crackling fire to drive out the chill November cold. As I was gazing absently at the flickering blaze the old wotnan's prophesy of the Summer came. \Vhat was to happen to me this month?

It was my junior year and I had play- ed end during my whole college course, and on the following day was to be my last game. \Well I thought, ''I hope I wont get killed as my mother and sister are to be at the game.\ As my mantel clock struck three it warned me that it was time to get ready for practice. I looked out o( my window which commanded a view of the gridiron. Some of the varsity were already out for practice. Yet as I looked that one thought kept com'ing back to n1e per- sistently: ''What is going to happen to tne to-morrow? Am I to get killed, tnaimed or- nothing?\ The fatal day dawned. The crowds poured in to see the game. Cheer followed cheer as we trotted out to take our positions. I gazed hurriedly over the assembled throng and finally distinguished the faces of 1ny rnother and sister, and could not help but note that their faces . . wore an anx1ous expression. \ Fudge ! I'm not going to get hurt,\ I n1uttered, and to prove my lucky star I de- termined to play a more reckless game than usual. '' Jad's playing a great game to-day·' I heard the captain say to the quarter. We were playing the last half and were winning. The ,old woman's warning was for- gotten. My fighting blood was up, my crimi- nal nature in the ascendancy. I had forgot- ten the old adage that, \Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.'' Finally the crash came. How ? Do not ask. A million lights flashed before my eyes, blazed up, burned out and fell, leaving me in darkness, the darkness of death. Still I could hear a confused humming, a murmur of n1any voices. Then I thought my sight was return- ing, for far in the distance was a faint patch of light. And as I watched it I thought I could see faces there. Yes, there were two, my mother's and sister's, no longer radiant and excited as I had last seen them, but drawn THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 with fear and grief. Then gradually they disappeared, and the blackness was all around me again. Then I seemed to be falling, fall- ing, with a terrible weight upon my breast. ''There must be an end to this,\ I thought, ''and that end will be death.'' Yet on I fell with limitless space below me and that awful weight pressing upon tne· Suddenly I felt my showlder grasped by an iron hand that crushed and mangled with its fearful grip, and I heard a voice say : * * * * * * \ Corne, J ad, wake up o1d man, it is time to dress for practice.

After a. satisfactory di11ner, the presiding o:ffice·r called for speeches· from various A1.um•ni. President Raymond responded with a few weB c·hosen remarks concerning the bright prospects for t h e future at Union, and touched briefly on the n1any changes and improvements which have recently been made in the grounds and buildings. He showed clearly the immense advantages coming fro1n the recently reorganized electrical department a:nd rendered due acknowledgement to the lib- eral assistance given by the General Electrical Com·pany and by Prof. Steinmetz. Prof. Conant expressed the hope that in tl:re near future, a chair of Pedagogy might he established at Union and that the College b:e thus enabled to take front rank in this impor-- tant b.ra1nch of education. Dr. Stoller presented the plan of the faculty's committee for the organization of a Teachers' Agency for the promotion of the interes-ts of Union tnen who are in that profession. This plan was unanitn,ously adopted, and Dr. Stoller was· recommended as chairman of the newly organized teachers' bureau.

The Theatre The Theatre party of the students at Party. the Van Uurler last vV ednesday night has evoked much adverse criticism from the local press. Some of the out of town papers give hair-raising accounts of the student body's \ outrageous conduct \ toward the Corse Payton Stock Co. Such a view of the case is more or less to be expected for· it is a well known and regretted fact that there is little or no sympathy between the College and the Town. Only those who know what a College is can· appreciate the situation and they are unanimous in ex· onerating the students from all blame. It is natural that several of the City's papers should side with the Rabble and pose as \ Darlings of the Gods'' for it is politic for them to cater to the Canaille. The ~' Even- ing Star, \ with a Union alumnus as Editor, alone has showed judgment and discretion in the matter. The letter which appeared in one of the daily organs, in which the writer wishes that she could \ find words to express the loathing, contempt and disgust '' that she feels toward the students, can be taken for what it is worth for it is signed \by one who is proud to call herself '' One of the Rabble.\ The inborn dislike which the Rabble experiences, and has in all time, of the educated classes, is the primal cause of trouble. Jealousy is the thorn in side of such a mob and but awaits the slightest opportunity to cloak its hatred under the pretense of offended dignity. Strange it seems to find outraged refinement in a heap of gar- bage ! Yet such, we~ are told, is the case. Strange also that we are reminded that the students were treat· d with great lenj.ency.

Such things how· ever, it seems, must happen iu a town where the Col· lege is regarded by the majority of inhabitants, who are ignoramuses, as more or less of a pest house. Noth· ing more can be expected from that class of people. The:re never will and never can be sympathy between the students of Union and the · lecherous rabble of the gutters. The only friends the· College has in town, and they are the only friends worth having, are those who understand what an institution 'Of learning means to any place and who are not so nauseatingly selfish as to call college fun and harmless youthful exuberance indecent and disreputable. THE THEATRE PARTY. Poor old Davy Crockett rests in peace, and it is lucky for many people that he does. The criticisms which were hurled at him and his memory last Wednesday evening at the Van Curler would certainly have justified him in wreaking a fearful vengeance. It is an incon- testable fact th~t the Mexicans and Indians, whom he used to meet q~ite frequently, and rip open with his bowie and plug with his rifle, treated him comparatively speaking like a gen- tleman. Now, whether Davy would have felt himself outraged more by the actions of the \elite \ and the \hoodlums \ in the audience than by the actors (?) and actresses ( ?) on the stag.e is a good question for debate. We shouldn't suggest this question for the Allison- Foote debaters nor for a Rutgers-Union ques· tion, but certainly some of the ''rabble,\ a . '' lady '' and most of the papers throughout the country would be strong on the side of the people who appeared before the footlights with and without appropriate costun1e. vVe don't know how Corse Payton's proteges took it, but if they look for interest and enthusiasm in an audience, they ought to have been satisfied one night last week. To run over some facts of the case which attracted widespread attention. One hundred and fifty pnion ~tudents assembled ii?- an opera THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 bouse do not constitute a good board of dram- atic cri6cs. They don't see~ to appreoiate the inherent genius and the forceful acting of the Cors;e Payton companies, and are too open and frank in the expression of their feelings. Whether they feel out of place in orchestra seats, or whether they labor under some sort · of hallucinations and think they are setting up freshmen, we won't say. Anyhow, the lead- ing man as Davy Crockett, __ did not seriously appeal to them. He wore the right kind of clothes, had a fair-looking shot-gun, a pretty little minuet and. swagger, a fog-horn voice, and a Sando\v arm, but somehow the fellows did not observe these things in th,e right way. He also could mend saddles but eouldn 't read, he kissed his mother (the poor thing), he al- ways made sure he was right and then went ahead, and he loved and married in a kind of Lochinvar style, but still the students were n~t pathetically moved. Again, the leading lady as Elinor Vaughn failed to influence the students as most girls usually do. She slept all the night long while poor Davy with his strong arn1 kept a howling and apparently hungry rat-terrier fro111 entering a muslin door. He needed something to cheer him up and he got it in the forn1 of good old Union songs and yells and words of encouragement in good old Union style. Eli11or's poetical reading did not whet the college men's literary appetite at all, and we hazard a guess that, to them as a sweetheart and wife, she was not particularly a woman. Her part seemed most· ly to submit to be carried on and off the stage by some one, preferably Davy, and she seemed most happy and so did the audience when she was being carried off. Again between the third and fourth acts, while Davy alias Loch- invar on his way to his \Nellie there appeared a sort of anachronisn1. as it were. We are not st~rs in history, but we fancy that in the time of Crock,ett he would not have especially cared to travel around the eountry with a female specimen of pioneer 1 ife as sl1e named Char- mion. Now a wrong idea should not be form- ed about her. She acted gracefully and well

Lovers of the poetry of Robert Browning and of literature in general were given a rare treat last Friday afternoon, when the Rev. Dr. Sawin of 'Troy lectured in the chapel be\ fore some friends, the faculty and the students of the college. Dr. Raymond introduced the speaker with a few well-chosen ren1arks, refer- ring to his previous visits to Union. From_ the moment that Dr. Sawin began to speak, his audience was held by his personality, his force of expression and his clearness of interpretation. He examined with critical appreciation three poems. The first was the rather obscure, \Pacchiarotto and his explanation of its meaning was given with considerable vivid- ness. T'he most interesting part of the lecture was Dr. Sawin's cotnparison of Browningys \ Childe Roland to the Dark T'ower Came '' with 'fen- nyson 's \Vision of Sin.'' He pointed out in an original manner the similarity of expression of certain passages and the striking likeness between the main thought in each poern. He disclaimed for Browning any hint of plagiarism. Dr. Sawin concluded his lecture with an in- terpretation of the poem ''Appearances.\ His characterization of its idea \vas short, con- cise and to the point. \Vhile in certain places the speaker seetned so carried away \\ 7 ith his subject as to over-interpret some thoughts, still he showed himself to be a 1naster of Browning, or, in other words, a scholar. At the close of the lecture many of the me1nbers of the faculty and of the student body availe dthemselves of the privilege of meeting Dr. Sawin at the President's residence. THE END OF FAITH: The man sat late into the night trying to collect his thoughts. He ·was alone; the lamp had b:urned out and the fire was fast slip- ping into ashes. Yes, he was alone, miserably so. · The events of the last week poured thro' his brain until it was all a confused sense of hopelessness. In vain he tried to remember his creed .and his faith. Everything alike sank into the distnal refrain-'' All is lost-all is lost.'' His had been a happy life until death had taken his beloved wife and child: -both in one week. 'fhis was his despair. He tried to grope thro' the meaning of it all but every sense seemed dutnb except the thought of ir- retrievable loss. \Vas all lost then ? He was young and n1aterial1y prosperous. That seemed nothing now. He was only conscious that nothing would matter again. Wh~re was his faith now? He thought he had been a christian and bad been to church regularly; and was this his reward? If there was a God and he was just how could he de- liberately cut off all his joy in life ? vVhat had his fair young wife and child to do with the monster death ? vVas it not all a horrible n1ockery? \Vhat if people did call hirn a fool for not believing-he wouldn't care for other people's thoughts or for anything else now. He would let himself die and n1ake an answer to the torturing question. Only open a little vein in the wrist·-=so-a.nd here by the fire the pain would not. be perceptible. No, it was not painful. A little warm pool gathered on the carpet. It was blood flo1ving fron1 his arm.

This. increased the flow of blood and in a few mo- ments he was dead. * * * * * Several years after, this story was to1d to a writer and he, ·with the aid of his in1agination, transforn1ed it into a moral principle which he stated in this forn1 : I found him on the road about to die, Bruised, cut and broken by a robber batld; And he lay silent, utteringno cry For all those wounds I scarce could understaad Such piteous restraint for bravery. I brought him water in my open hand And bathed his brow to soothe his misery. His eyes did question me and make demand \Vhy I had come to show him charity. He knew that he was dying ; when I spoke, Asking about his friends in his behalf He gave me such a terrifying look I brought him water for his lips to quaff. Yet when I mentioned God and showed His nook lie smiled at me, then broke into a laugh. THE PICTORIAL CHARACTER OF TENNYSON'S EARLY POETI~Y. Tennyson, in so far as his early wo-rk is con- sidered, was primarily a poet of Sensation. He was thus characterized by his friend Hal- lam, who says : '' '\fennyson sees all the forn1s of nature with the eruditus oculus, and his ear has a fairy fineness. There is a strange earn.- estness in his worship of beauty, which throws a charm over his impassioned song, more easi- ly felt than described, and not to be escaped by those who have once felt it.'' An1011g the fine distinctive excellencies of T'ennyson's poetry, as noted by Hallam, is : \ His vivid and picturesque delineation of objects, and the peculiar skill with which he holds all of thetn fused.\ This characteristic, together with the luxuriance of his imagination, accounts for the pictorial pow·er,. in the main, in Tenny· son's works. The ability to present vivid pictures to the mind n1ay be called one of the requirements of a great poet. To set a landscape before the eyes by appropriate words : to paint a liv- ing scene by ideas expressed in words, and to fuse the words into the idea so that the picture stands out clearly and beautifully from thy, canvas ; these capabilities were Tennyson's, and his power to portray by almost realistic_ description the visions of his sight or imagina.:- tion is one of the greatest charms of all his ·work. Especially is the pictorial charact~r evident in his early poetry. In \ Claribel'' the following lines will illus- trate the vivid presentation of pictures : '' At eve the beetle boometh Athwart the thicket lone, At noon the wild bee hummeth About the massed headstone : At midnight the moon cometh And looketh down alone.'' Any one can, and without much effort at in1agination, see the bee humming about the grave stone or the lonely moon looking down at n1idnight. In \ Leonine Elegaics,\ a rath- er abnormal production in verse, the separate pictures are very vivid : for instance: '\ Thro' the black-stemmed .. pines, only the far river shines,'' and '' Over the pools in the burn water gnats n1urmur and mourn.'' ''The Kxaken '' is almost wholly imaginative and its chief merit lies in its wonderful picture of a sleeping. sea-monster. Take the lines- '' Faintest sunlights .flee About his shadowy sides : above him swell Huge sponges of millennial growth and height: And far away into the sickly light, From many a wondrous grot and secret cell Unnumbered and enormot1s polypi, Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.\ No less effective and \'much 1nore filled with n1eaning are the two ''Marianas,'' the first the ac1ne of description of loneliness and the oth .. er equally vivid in its delineation of a deserted house, save for a single tenant, in a torrid clime. Such lines as- • .. ,f '','{ J ·. t i :· .. \:. ... . . . ' . ' ./! ' ··,! ·' II ' 'j ''I .. l ' ·~ l 'I . ~

'' Shrank one sick willow, sere and small The river-bed was dusty-white ; And all the furnace of the light Struck up against the blinding wall.'' illustrate in part the pictorial power of the poems. \The Dying Swan\ is particularly beauti- ful in its pictorial character. We can, by the slightest attention, see the dying swan float- Ing down the stream and singing on its way. We may feel the wind : \ Ever the weary wind ·went on, and took the reed tops as it went.'' We may see the river and the n1arsh and the swallow overhead, '' Chasing itself at its own wild will.'' The lines : '' One willow over the river wept and shook the wave as the wind did sigh,\ are most effective. In the Sonnet : ''Mine be the strength of spirit, full and free,\ there are sotne excellent pictures, such as : '' Son1e broad river rush- ing down alone,\ and \In the middle of the green salt sea, keeps his blue waters fresh for many a mile.\ \ The Lady of Shalotte \ is a single picture, that is, it is a composite of many pictures, woven in harmony. There are too many beautiful and true pictorial passages to admit quotations of them all, but the following are selected : and \ Willows whiten, aspens quiver. Little breezes dusk and shiver.\ '' Sometimes a troop of damsels glad, An abbot or an ambling pad, ~ometimes a curly shepherd lad Or long-haired page in crimson clad.'' '' In the stormy east wind straining, The pale yellow woods were vraning, The broad stream in his banks complaining, Heavily the low sky raining.\ In '' Oenone, '' there are some marvellous pictures : for .... instance : '' The swimming vap~ ors lopes athwart the glen, puts forth an arm THE OONOORDIENSIS. 7 and creeps fron1 pine to pine.'' \ The Palace of Art,'' is, of course, full of effective pictures, but we select the ·following ones as character- istic . '' One seemed aH dark and red, a track of sand And some one pacing there alone, \Vho paced forever in a glimmering land Lit by a low, large moon.\ ''.And one, an Eng-lish home-gray twilight pour'd On dewy pastures, dewy trees, Softer than sleep-all things in order stored, A haunt of ancient Peace.\ \ 'fhe Lotus Eaters \ is rich in the pictorial element and the touches are most delicate. Take the lines : \ Music that softer falls than night dews on still waters between walls of a shadowy granite in a g1eatning pass.\ That is a master touch. The '' Dream of Fair Women \ contains too n1any pictures for individual exatnination, so that a few representative lives in this particu- lar are excerpted.\ Growths of jasmine turn- ed their humid arms festooning tree to tree, and at the root thro' bush green grasses burn' d the red anemone.\ '' Mort D' Arthur,\ and ''The Vision of Sin \ may be taken as the last representative early poems in which the pictorial elements are worthy of note. The following verses are selected from the two poems respectively : ''And bore him to a chapel nigh the field, A. broken chancel with a broken cross That stood on a:. dark strait of barren land. On one side lay the ocean and on one Lay a great water, ~nd the moon was full.\ \ I saw a gray and gap-tooth'd man: as lean as death, Who slowly rode across a w1thered heath, And lighted at a ruined inn.\ To treat of the pictorial characteristic of Tennyson's poetry in a limited space seetns almost like a paradox. There can be no doubt that this power is one of the leading element~ in the t~ue greatness of his work. It lends beauty, iife and light to all poetry and how much more so when a, tn.~ster paints ! It is '' mystic, WQ~~~rful ! ' 1

The Small. , .. · A recent edtiorial in ''The Saturday v;. The Large Evening Post\ remarks : '·' A College College. president, speaking of an American university, has said that the tJlection of studies in that unive'rsity is made by the students on two principles. The first is the principle of \cinch \ which consists in choosing those courses which are easy, The . second is \ bunch/, consisting of the cnooslng of sub· jects on the ground of the recitations or lectures falling in hours that are neal· together.'' The first of these principles applies to conditions at Union and is to be regretted. From the second, how- ever, we are comparatively free, since for a small college it is practically i:rnpossible. So that is consoling to the small College. '' 'The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong,'' Atrophy. 1?resident Raymond's remarks in Chap· el a week ago brought home to the stu· dent body a deplorable condition of affairs at Union with regard to half.dead College organizations. ...<\s he aptly said : '' They had far better be dead and decently buried.'' The reason for this state of affairs can be given without hesitation or difficulty. What is commonly known as College Politics is responsible for this general atrophy. Perhaps the atrophy is born of disgust. It is enough to nauseate any man to see the political worm at work. If we were French, we might start a revolution, but being college students, silence gives contempt. There is no remedy for such apathy, except that every mau work independently for the interests ·Of the college and in behalf of those organizations which are worth up· holding, and yet fi!ld themselves sadly .in need of efficient support.

.. r r '· THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XX\\. UNION 'COLLEGE, JANUARY 13, 1904:. No.12. PROFESSOR HOFFMA·N ON HER- BERT SPENCER. On Sunday evening, December ~oth, there was held at the Unitarian church in Albany a·· public meeting in comtnemoration of the life · and ·work of Herbert Spencer. Prof. Frank Sargent Hoffman, Ph. D., head of the depart· ment of mental and moral philosophy at Union college, delivered the principal address an_d took for his subject, \Herbert Spencer's Con· tribution to Philosophy.\ An abstract of Prof. Hofftnan's remarks follows : \It is understood at the outset that I shall make no attempt to give you a detailed esti- mate of Herbert Spencer's Rhilosophy, but on· ly a description of its main features and some cotnments regarding its permanent worth. Be- fore we can properly appreciate Herbert Spen- cer's point of view, we need to know at least a few facts about his personal history. His father and an uncle were his only teachers and most of his early life was spent in the study of the natural sciences. When about 17 years of age he entered the office of Sir Charles Fox and began work as a civil engineer. He kept to this profession for about 10 years, though he does not s'eem to have pursued it with any great enthusiasm. His first literary effort of itnportance was a series of letters on The Proper Sphere of Gov· ernment, published in r842, and his last work, entitled Fact and Comment, -vvas published in 1902. What we have to say about him goes over these 6o .rears of almost ceaseless labors. Although in 1855 he first published his Prin- ciples of Psychology, it was not until 186o that h,e sent out his prospectus giving a complete outline of the ten volumes that he intended to ~ deyote to the elaboration of what he calls ~ynthetic Philosophy. Eight of those volumes ll_ave _actually seen the light of day. It is in the first-volume of this serie·s entitled First Principles; that we find expounded Spen· cer· s most important .. philosophical positions. Here it may well be noted that the estimate we put upon any man's philosophy will always depend upon· the philosophy th.at \Ve bring to the · task. For every thoughtful person has ·a philosophy of some sort and even the most elaborated philosophy of the technical expert is simply his way of viewing tne facts of the universe that have come within h·is range of VlSlOn. This accounts for the great number of phi· losophies that have arisen in the course of his- tory. From the very nature of the case 'each ·age must construct its own philosophy. We have· no reason to suppose that there ·will not be as many philosophies in the future as· in the past. This will certainly be true if the world keeps on increasing in its knowledge. That man is the greatest philosopher who best ex- presses· the results of the combined labors of his age, who best unifies and interprets the ascertained facts of his day and generation. In what I have to say about· Herbert Spen- . ' cer, I shall attempt to judge of him from this standpoint. To begin with, did he accept this idea of the n1ission of philosophy ? Most assuredly. He expressly declares that philosophy is \the uni· fication of knowledge.\ There is no truth anywhere that does not cotne -within the sphere of philosophy. It is the unification of all truth. Theology, for example, can not have any validity if it is to be thought of as outside of philosophy. The same thing may be said of every other alleged science. 'This is one of Spencer's greatest contributions, in my opin- ion, to philosophy among Engli-sh-speaking . people~ For the thought in his day was not r an unfamiliar one in some other lands .. •

This is the famous doctrine of agnosticism .. But Spencer goes on to add that we must as· sert that the Supreme Being is, but we cannot tell what it is. Here Spencer did for his ti:n'le a much needed work. Almost everywhere i~t w~s. the custom of theologians and people gei1- eraliy to talk about God and his ways as if they knew all about his plans and purposes.

This he does with such a wealth of facts that his encyclopedic knowledge is wor- thy of comparison with that of Aristotle. His greatest positive contribution to the world's thought is probably in the region _pf sociology, at least that part of it that de~ls with man alone, omitting the portion dealing with the sub-hu-man element. He also did a great work in popularizing the subject of ethi~s, though he did not go deeply into the matter. 1.'he '' good '' he defines as '' what brjng~ a surplus of agreeable feeling; \ as '' coodu.ct, in the last stages of evolution-well adapted .. to its end.'' And justice he describes in the. f<?r- mular, \Each individual ought to be .sP.b.Ject to the effects of its own nature and re~ultipg conduct.'' He nowhere tells where .. this

Assuming this feeling of obligation, no writer has more vividly described how our id€as as to what is just change with changing con- ditions. As to the state his chief contribution is in the direction of emphasizing the in1portance of the individuals. But he has not reached the ,deeper view of man's relation to the body-pol- itic. For he does not regard the individual as attaining his fulfillment in the state but in antithesis to it. Yet the world would be de- cidedly the loser if it did not make much of his ''law of equal freedotn.\ Herbert Spencer devoted all his time and strength and resources through evil report and good report to the elaboration of his system. If ever any man persistently adhered through all his life to what he firmly believed to be the truth, he did, and if this constitutes the essence of religion, I-Ierbert Spencer was one of the most religious men of his age, and de- serves a high place in the catalogue of the saints.\ THERAPEUTICS. I. \Yesterday that is, yesterday a year ago, \ I went down to the Peiraeus \ as a very il- lustrious tramp, emulable in all respects ex- cepting his footgear and his choice of a wife, did upon a certain yesterday son1e twenty- three centuries ago. I did not go ''with Glaucon the son of Ariston '' though, nor with any other Greek, but solus : nor did I go ''to pray to the gods and see how the Peiraeans conducted their festival,\ but rather as the Dorpian goes to New Yol\lc to take in what- ever might be taken in through open eyes and tnouth agape. No'v, as I strolled about the streets of the Peiraeus, I came to a shop window which ar- rested my attention. It was an optician's window. In this window were the usual in- struments by which science \multiplies the range of human life by two,\ and gives men a ~HE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 second sight, which, 'if it does not penetrate the future, does at least very much ,extend the present: in brief there were spectacles in this window as there should be in every well reg- ulated optidan's window. There were other things there, though~ which you wHl not find even in the best regu- lated optician's window in this country. Along with the spectacles were exhibited numerous little silver images, images of eyes, of ears, .of legs, of hands, of feet, of babies, of the whole corpus in fact, and of many of its members. However, it was not the ilnages themselves that arrested my attention for I had seen their like before and had come to know what they were for ; rather it was this strange juxtapo- sition of g:Iass eyes and silver eyes, for this juxtaposition meant that in our optician's shop the god Aesculapius and the goddess Sci entia were bidding -vvith equal favor for the suffrages of the near-sighted, the far-sighted, the sight- less, the one-eyed, the blear-eyed. the cross- eyed, the pink-eyed, for all in fact who see amiss or do not see at all. There are those who believe that the god Aesculapius is as dead as Pan.. He is not dead. He is sit-nply practising incog. In one place he is called Saint :Barbara, having put on skirts as well as changed his name ; in an- other place Saint Evangelistria ; in another place Saint Someboclyelse. He is much named then, but still very n1nch alive. Go in- to nearly any chapel or church in Greece and you will see in.nun1erable images, like those in the optician's window, suspended before the eikons of saints supposed to have miraculous power in healing the sick. 1\'hese images are votive offerings intended to supplicate the fa- vor of the saint. They correspond to the offerings to Aesculapius ·which have been found in abundance at the Epidauric sanctuary ·0f the god excepting that the ancient offerings were always, so far as I know, thank offerings for cures effected while the modern ones are usually prayer offerings for cures sought. However, there are healing rites in modern Greec~ whi~h show more clearly than these

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. votive images that the god Aesculapius, though disguised and christened, is not dead. The ancient rites tnay easily be inferred from the caricature in'' The Plutus'' of Aristophanes and still more easily from the votive tablets recording miraculous cu.res which have been unearthed at Epidaurus. The method of heal- ing was called incubation (engkoemesis). 1\'he patient would go to the temple of the ·God, or at Epidaurus to the colonnade (abaton) called in one inscription, the dormitory (engkoeme- terion). As he slept the God would appear to him in a vision and either cure him then and there, or else tell hi,m what he should do in or- der to be cured. Healing rites of precisely the sa1ne sort are stiH practised in many of the sanctuaries of Greece as, for example, at the church of Saint Barbara a little way out from Athens and near the Holy Road over which the Eleusinian votaries used to go to Eleusis. But the most favored temple of healing, the New Zion of modern Greece I suppose ·we may call it, is the church of Saint Evangelistria on the is1and of Tenos. Thith- er twice yearly on the festival days of the saint, throng the lame, the halt and the blind, from all parts of the Greek world, and many pilgrims with them. 1'he patients, as of old, sleep in the temple, see visions or fail to see them, and awaken cured, curable or despair-_ . tng. At the church of Saint Barbara, to which I have alluded, a miracle of healing was per- formed shortly after Jny arrival in Athens. On the eve of the festival of the saint a good Greek father and mother from one of the is ... lands, if I remember rightly, brought their deaf and dumb girl to the sanctuary and laid her down before the eikon of the saint. The child slept there that night and ~aw a vision too, I suppose. At all events, while the ser- vice of the saint was being celebrated next day, the little girl broke her long silence and called out to her parents. They came to her and found that she could speak and hear as well as anybody, wher~ppon ~1~ the worship- , pers in great glee conducted the father and mother and the .child to .A.thens. That night I spoke .of the n1iracle to n1y Greek host, a godly man and intelligent, a school teacher in fact. f-Ie said that the cure was attested beyond aH possibility of doubt and immediately capped it with another mira- cle of Saint Barbara. My host had a daughter -has her still for that matter, unless Mr. Keram opoulos has run off with her. His daughter had a friend and this .friend played the piano. Now my host's daughter's friend had two hands but suddenly she lost the use of one of thetn and therefore peace and quiet. reigned in her household for several years. However, one night as she slep:t, Saint Bar- bara appeared to her in a vision and said \When you awaken in the morning go to the piano and play.,, And so when she awakened in the .morning, she went to the piano and played.

The following is taken fron1 the Schenectady '' Daily Union '' for Jan. 9th. rrhe city of Schenectady will play an im- po~tant part in the educational exhibit which the state of New York is to send to St Louis. An exhibit of the high school and of the public schools is now in course of preparation' under the direction of Superintendent Howe, and will cover written exercises in most. of the ele- mentary subjects in the different grades, and also an exhibit in mechanical drawing from the high school and the eighth grades. The exhibit in tnechanical drawing sent to Cliff Haven from Schenectadylast summer was a subject of favorable criticism on the part of a committee appointed to examine the Cliff Haven exhibit, and the exhibit for St. Louis in this line is prepared at the special requst of the. director of education for the state.

Union university is planning to make an elaborate exhibit in electrical engineering, and will send apparatus which is now in use in its laboratories and which is peculiar to this insti- tution. It is contem.p1ated to exhibit a part · · of the alternating current laboratory, and to show a rotary converter built for ,college lab- oratories, alternate current generator and mo- tor with extra induction motor armatures also . built especially for colleges. Methods of laboratory instruction in sopho- :tnore, junior and senior classes will be shown, Union's exhibit will furnish all the artificial Hgh t and power ~sed in the state educational · .exhibit as a whole, and will make possible many beautiful light effects during the evenings that· the exposition is open to the public. When visiting the exposition there is every indication that Schenectadians will have every reason to be proud of our educational institu- tions. The exhibits are now in course of prepara- tion, and will soon be sent to the office of the director of education, D. M. Ellis, at Roches- ter, where the general exhibit is to be assem- bled, classified and arranged for installation at St. Louts. The ge11eral plans of installation will be most attractive. The elevation of the enclosure will be constructed of Flemish oak with panel set off by fluted pilasters. The walls will be covered with a light green bur- lap. There will be a handsorne ornamental prize set in over the burlap, giving a very beautiful effect. rrhe entrance will be through a massave arch, flanked by the coat-of-arms of the state of New York. New York's assignment of space in the edu- cational building has been commensurate with her importance in the educational field. The exhibit will be located at the corner of the two intersecting main aisles, directly facing the main entrance of the building. The exhibits of ·Massachusetts, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Missouri will all be near at hand. THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 THE GARNET. A few weeks more and the College annual will be expected to appear. The Editors of I go 5 promise a good book and with some new features, but complain that there is not enough interest displayed by members of the other classes in preparing it for production. 1\he interest for which they hunger is not that which is shown a few days before the time the book is scheduled for appearance. 1,hey want contributions at once in the line of drawings, photographs and literary work. Anyone can criticise the book on its introduction, but everyone won't know with what difficulty the n1aterial for it was obtained. The importance of the book when it appears in print, and bound ready for praise or censure ought to be known. Nothing else connected with the college appeals more strongly to a would-be student than this representation of its follies, joys and perhaps sorro·ws. The Editors don't want it to be their work alone, nor is it a monopoly for the class of r9o5. Well, the book must con1e out for better or for worse. Shall we wait and hope, or do something and expect. An important factor of the Garnet is the literary department. If this is good it adds to the value of the whole. It does not deal with the bare records and statistics of our college activities but is a living portrayal of our college life and interests. 1,echnically the Garnet :Board is responsible for the book but virtually every n1an in college snares in the responsibility of his college annual and it is his duty to do his share in n1aking it a true record of his college life and interests. All can help in the literary department and every man's help is needed. The literary editors cannot do it all nor are they expected to. If each student does his little he need not doubt as to the re .. suit. All literary material must be in the hands of the literary editor by the 3rd of February. Do not read this, pass on and for- get. Help a little and it will be greatly ap .. preciated,. , You will not regret it •.

To every one now-a-days the new year brings strenuosity. There are resolutions to be made and as regularly broken. Theroe is the ,thought that another yea~r of our span has passecl and that unless we are up and doing time will soon work its destiny on our years and our liYes be lived in vain. The new year ~s already upon us. and with it comes many responsibilities. Who, for instance, h~s not made some determination for the betterment of his friends or himself? Not the musty annual \' resolutions,\ which nearly always succumb to a few days or weeks pressure, but some rewl feeling that life can and rnust be made a little n1ore w0rth while living. If this idea ;b.as its foun- dation laid tin truth, the structure wHl depend on individ- ual strength, and in the completion or demolition of the building lies the responsibilities. The earth is a year older and have we done anything to make anyone happier? If so, the year has not been in vain. If during the brief year of a man's life he has shown kinciness and gentleness to some of his fellow men his sojourn reaps its own rewa.rd in the hearts of friends. To live in preparation for tomorrow is good but to live unselfishly is far better. The tomor.row we seek may never come so that the perfection of today marks the beauty of a life.

There's a booming deep bass in the song that I sing, An.d a treble, a gnat-like melodious zing, And a buzz--buzz-buzz, like hornets and bees, Cantata electric in six minor keys.

Tho' they touch not, yet fearsomely you reel Back from their clutches with a sinking soul. The natural departs and moments roll In slow suspense.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 13 INTERCOLLEG lATE. About five hundred students at the Univer- sity of Wisconsin are self-supportin:g. '''The analysis of college life shows two diseases of the co liege mind-force culture and a habit of indecision.'' This criticism, in substance, was a state- ment of the dangers of college training made by the Rev. Professor \\V. D. MacClintook in his baccalaureate address to the students of the University of ·Chicago. Of forced culture the professor said : \The mind reaches forth beyond its natural stage of growth; the boy would be a man. Conceit, self-consciousness, imitation of older men's disillusions, take possession of minds which should be merely learning and playing.\ Of indecision he said: '' The colleges tend to cultivate the indecisive judgment, the feel- ing that things will wait and there is no hurry.'' He urged \the attainment of strong per- sonal conviction and determination; develop- ment of faith in human progress; simplicity of n1ind and freedom from provincialism.\ Dr. ~aymond gave a very interesting and ' instruc~ive talk at the vesper service Sunday afternoqn.

This is the first university on the island. Robert ,C. Ogden, head of the Wanan1aker store here, gave an address on '' 'The College Graduate In Retail Trade '' before the students in the natural history hall of the N. Y. City College at 17 Lexington Avenue recently. President Finley introduced Mr. Ogden by saying that he didn't know how many degrees the speaker had, but that he deserved two, Docfor of Humanity and Doctor of Things in General. Mr. Ogden said that he had just come from the Wanamaker store, wh~re he had been giv- ing a Harvard professor his first vie\v of a great retail store. \Education in common with other things,\ said Mr. Ogden, \ is becoming democratized. There is a growing sympathy between educa- tion and practical life which the complexity of n1odern civilization requires.
