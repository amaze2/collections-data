Mountebanks Announce Z-511 Neilson,. Jaffe Address Students At Convocati.on America·nism, Democracy Discussed By Speakers The opening of the 146th Aca- demic year at Union College was .. officiaJly observed with Convoca- tion exercises Monday moraing in Memorial Chapel. Dr. Wimam Al- lan Neilson, presideat-emeri•tus of Smith College, and William B. Jaffe, '26, were the prindpa·l speak- ers. Dr. Neilson expressed as the key- note of his address a confidence in American youth to make honest and courageous decisions when they under stand the real rea:sons behind the .present conflict. He claimed that America:n students had been led astray to a path of 'indifferentism' by certain postwar ideas wh·ich had been furthered by educational leaders, including him- self. Neilson Scorns Scoldings Scolding and preaching are due, at present, to the impression that students are lagging behind the country in an understanding of present conditions, and in patriot- ism, the former Smith president asserted. \For twenty years,\ he sa:id, \we have been telling successive gener- ations that from 1917 to 1918 we were engage<i in a conf·lict in which we were dupes. You, the students of today, have been taught that war was hot'l'Ot', statesmen ingenu- ous, and peace-makers shortsighted. Undeigraduates of today have been brought up in an atmosphere of pacifism and criticism of the elder statesmen.\ Dr. Neilson mentioned that peo- ple did not always find that the word democr·acy raised the pulse of students. This was caused by disgust with the .behavior oif poli- ticians, corruption, and lac!>: of en- thusiasm in their elders. Cites Advantages The septuagenarmn chided stu- dents for not noticing advantages that they have, and read a letter from a member of the English Labor Party expressing those things for which the English peo- ple are fighting and which Ameri- cans take for granted, such as: good faith, tolerance, respect for opinions, mercy for the weak, equal justice, .intercourse between neigh- bors, free speech, protection aganist violence, a re.presentative voice in government, the right of criticism, and simple moralities. President Dixon Ryan Fox intro- duced the native of Scotland as a man of prestige who enjoyed .the respect of the whole United States for exhibiting a .prophetic vision of young people and 'being an unhesi- tatingly sturdy liberal. Dr. Neilson's address was pre- ceded l;:y the formal presentation of a set of portraits of the presi· dents of the United States by Mr. Jaffe. The alumnus, member of the class of 1926, called in his speech· for ·an aroused citizenry to protect· the simple truths that were \self evident to our forefathers.\ ---0--- Mountebanks Announce Coming Productions A murder mystery, a Russian comedy of Czarist days and an old fashioned melodramatic farce· were chosen for presentation this year by the Executive Committee of the Mountebanks, meeting Wednesday night. The committee also elected Roger Marshall, '41, of Roslyn Height, Long Island, President, and John T. Boyt, '42, of Bloomfield, New J·ersey, Secretru·y. Alec Cappel's \I Killed the Count,\ the murder mystery, was picked as the fall play to be given sometime in November. The· Rus- sian comedy chosen for the win- ter production is Nicolai Gogel's \The Inspector General.\ The an- nual Prom Play, \The Black Crook\ by Boucicault is a melo- dramatic farce. Marshall formerly was business manager and Boyt a member of the Executive Committee of the Moun- tebanks. UNION COLLEGE Ll BR AR 1 il tfttSlS Former Seniors Lead On Dean's List UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N.Y., FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1940 PRICE FIVE CENTS Union Popular College For Early Roosevelts Two years ago, Mrs. Roosevelt urprised Union students who heard her lecture here by re• calling that the President's father and grandfather were Union men. Concord1ensis re- search revealed that CorneLius Mason Roosevelt, was in the class of 1813 and James Roose- velt, the President's father, in the class of 1847. [ Fox Gives Views On Conscription Of College Men FiveNewMembers F·reshman Class Numbers 214 Men; Added to Faculty Rep,resents 10 States,. 3 Countries Little is known about either of the Roosevelt's colleg.e ca- reers. Cornelius entered in Sept. 1809 and left in the middle of November, joining the United State's Navy as a midshipman. He served in the Navy until March 5, 1810 resigning. to go into business. James Roosevelt was admitted into the senior class on Septem- ber 4, 1846: He lived in 21 South college catalogues for 1846 I and '47 t•eveal and was a mem- bet· of the Delta Phi fraternity. Dean Announces Scholarship List Senior Class of 1940 Has Best Class Rating; Present Juniors Second Two hundred thirty-nine stu- dents, among them 67 members of the class of 1940 are numbered on the final Dean's list for the last academic year. The former seniors had the largest number of men on the list followed by the class of 1942 with 61 and the class of 43 with 58. The present senior class placed lowest with 53 men.

Stev- (Contmued on Page 6) Union Students 2 I Or Over Must Roegister On October 16th No Union College student will be conscripted for service in the armed forces of the United States during the present academic year, President Dixon Ryan Fox an- nounced yesterday. Although all ~tudents over 21 years of age must register on October 16, under the new draft bill they will be ex- empted until June 30, 1941. Dr. Fox also pointed out that those students who ·are immediate- ly affected by the Selective Service Act must decide whether they wi~h to register under the act in Schenectady or in the place of their family residence. There is no guamntee, added the prlesident, that college students who become eligible fo1· draft during the 1941-42 academic year will be granted the same exemption that has been given ~tudents for this year. Admitting that compulsory mili- tary service was unfortunate from the standpoint of the individual, Dr. Fox said a majority in the na- tion believe .that it is a necessary precaution, and, therefore, he con- siders it worthy legislation. Expressing the opinion that, be- cause of the need of engineers in the service, engineering school en- rollments may raise during the next few years, Dr. Fox claimed that Union probably will not feel this trend·. Although, he said, the administration cannot plan too far ahead in these times, the col- lege will continue to keep the en- rollmen.t of engineering students at one-fourth of the total student body_ The president added that he hoped the draft officers would call young men at \segments. of their lives.\ These he described as com- ing ·after the conclusion of their secondary school educatio·n and after the conclusion of their col- lege education. These are natural breaks, he said, and a year of mili- tru·y service at these times would not cause very much individual rearrangement. For Coming Year Appointments Include Exiled Italian Count, Prominent Chemist Five appointments to the .faculty were announced last Friday by President Dixon Ryan Fox follow- ing the first faculty meeting of the year. Included in the appointments was Count Carlo Sfmza, exiled for- eign minister of Italy and ambas- sador to France during ·the last World War, who will 'be the Carne- gie Visiting Professor of Interna- tional Rela:tions. Other faculty additions this fall are: Dr. Spencer .C. Stanford, who was co-discoverer with Dr. Walter Gordy, of a new type of hydrogen \bond\ to be instructor in c'hem- istry. Dr. Stanford's \bonds\ a:re mechanisms by ·means of which atoms are held together in a mole- cule. He was graduated from Massachusetts ·state College and re- ceived his master of science and doctorate degrees from Western Reserve University where he also taught. He has taught at Alderson Broaddus College, Wayland Junior College and the College of Wooster before coming to Union; Got don A. Rust, a graduate of Amherst ·College and Columbia in 1934 and an instructor in English at the University of 1llinois where he received his doctorate. Mr. Rust will be an instructor in English and faculty adviser to the Mounte- banks; Henry G. Harlow to be an in- structor in civil engineering. A graduate of Tufts and of Harvard, he has been an assistant engineer for the Associated Factory Mutual Fire Insurance Company; Henry A. Baker is a graduate of the University of Kansas and of Yale. He has conducted research work at bo~h universities and has been a research assistant at Yale's Institute of Human Relations. Count Sforza delivered two lec- tures here in 1936, speaking on in- ternational relations. While in resi- dence he will lecture in various classes as well as give several pub- lie speeche~. No date .has been an- nounced for his arrival. Many Campus Improvements Made By Administration During Summer . According to statistics compil<'d •·------------------ by one of the research departments of a large Mid-Western university which concentrates on such vito.! items, the percentage of improw- ment of the physical plants of American colleges is the lowest of that in ali other major industries in America. We understand that one-half of one per cent is the fig- ure arrived at after much effort. Although unable to discover the exact basis for the figures pub- lished by the distinguished uni- versity, as we cannot see how it is possible to arrive at a per- centile for a coat of paint or a new set of porch steps in respect to all the coats of paint and porch steps possessed by the several col- leges of the nation, it is certain that Union g.ot. the most out of its one-half of one per cent during the past summer ·alone with at least seven major improvements effected. Chief among the projects under- talten was the much needed recon- struction of Alexander Field which will make for greatly improved .playing conditions duting the fall and spring wet spells, in addition to supplying more extensive fa- cilities for track and other sports. Work on the field has been pro- gressing since· the 'beginning of summer, and the first seed was sown Monday. Also accomplished in the past three months was the complete remodelling and redecorating of the former Ellery residence in South College. The decoration scheme for the rooms was per- sonally designed by Mrs. Fox. The house is now occupied by Profes- sor Benjamin Whitaker and his family. A further addition for the ath- letic department was the renova- tiOn of the shower rooms m the gymnasium. The swimming pool also was benefited by the acquisi- tion of a new chlorinator. The Social Studies department now may take advantage of much additional space made available by the construction of new paritions in Bailey HalL The heating system in the Engineering Building has been improved by the rearrange- ment of radiators·, and the in- stallation of new piping and two unit heaters in the vestibules at the entrances of the buildmg. Much painting was done on va- rious college buildings over the vacation period. The interiot· of the Biology building. as• well as that of the Psychology labora- tories was. done, and th<J exteriors of North College, South Colleg·e and Hale House. The exterior of the home of Professor George D. Kellogg was also painted. A change which has occasioned varied reaction among dormitory residents is the innovation of a new system of locks for use in the dormitories this year. According to this setup, the dormitory resi- dents will use one key with which to open both the door of their respective sections and their own rooms. This precaution is. expected to assure the students greater pro- tection from the petty thefts which have plagued the dormitories in past years. Duplication of dorm keys by stu- dents or others, will ·be impossible as the college secured special blanks. No key shop in Schenec- tady carries such 'blanks and it is impossible to have the key made up on another size. All campus· Improvements made over the summer months were in charge of Comptroller Anthony Hoadley, Fox, Cowley Support JJ?iUkie's Candidacy Union a·nd Hamilton have at last found something they agree upon or a:t least that their re- spective Presidents do, for in a letter to the Republican presi- dential cand'idate, Dr. Fox an.d Dr. Cowley have set forth rea- sons for shifting their support trom President Roosevelt to Wendell L. Willkie. Typical of the large number of press· clippings recording the event is one ·from the War- chester Massachusetts \Gazette the writer of whic·h seems to know something about Union· Hamilton rivalry. He says \W~ should think Mr. Willkie, if he knows of Hamilton and Union I!Ild of the rarity with which they get together on anything, except each ethel'S necks and nerves, would be deeply appre- ciative of the expression by Drs. Fox and Cowley. Politics makes strange ·bedfellows but not much stranger than this.'' The two presidents are for Willkie because his \economic and social creed seems to re- present the realistic liberalism that ought properly to guide the nation in the trying times through which we are living.'' Military Air Duty C. A. A. Pledge Dr. Wold Predicts Quota of 40 Men For Union Air Course All students who enroll in the Civil Aeronautics Authol\ity flying course for the current acadernic year will have to pledge them- selves to ail· duty in the military service of the United States, Dr. P. I. Wold, director of the Union College branch of the C.A.A., an- nounced in a daily assembly ~alk yesterday. No military commit- ments have been required of avia- tion students in the past. \It is natural,\ said Dr. Wold, pointing to the recent passage of the Selective Service Bill in Con- gress, \that the C.A.A. should be geared in with the defense pro- gram of this country.\ Thd pi edge that applicants will sign before the~- wlll be considered eligible for the flying course is, \I pledge my- self to flight training in the mili- tary service of the United States.' Although Dr. Wold is awaiting the seeting of the actual quota of students to be taken this ;~rear. he estimated it would be in the neigh- borhood of 40 men. As soon as w01 d is received from C.A.A. officials in Washington, the quota will be re- leased. Any students who wish to apply for their year's cours·e have been requested to make their applica- tion with either Dr. Wold or Dr. Thatcher at the Psysics Building. If they at·e able to pas;; '1 pre- liminary physical examination by the college physician and satisfy the college's requirements as to scholarship, another phY'5ical ex- amination by C.A.A. physicians will be scheduled·. If the· doctors' report is satisfactory, they will be en- rolled for the· course. ---0--- Dr. Ellery Telegraphs Best Wishes to College Edward Ellery, Professor Emeri- tus of Chemistry and former dean of the l!'aculty, sent President Fox a telegram from his sumrner home in Maine Monday wishing the students and faculty of the college a successful year. The telegram, sent from South Paris, reads: \To former and new students, to faculty colleagues and to your successful leader of all, my sincere wishes for Union's bes.t year.\ Dr. Ellery retired from the Union faculty last June after serving fot• thirty-six years. This past year he was· elected president of Sigma Xi, national honorary scientific fraternity. Class Scholarships T otaJing $14,600 Awarded to 50 Men A total of 214 men have been en- rolled in the Uni'On College fresh- man class for the 1940-41 session, it was announced Tuesday morning by Mr. Frederic A. Wyatt in his address to the ::>tudent body at the first regular chapel period of the year. Continuing with the available statistics on the class of 194·:1, Mr. Wyatt explained that the fresh- man re·present ten states as well as three foreign countries. There are th'l·ee men from Cuba, Greece, and Poland, 33 from New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylania, Connecti- cut, Massachusetts, Indiana, West Virgin'ia, Rhode Island and Illi- nois, with the remainder distrib- uted throughout New York State. In the distribution of courses the science students at·e the most numerous with 72. members. The Social Studies Division has 64, the Engineet·s 63, and the Lang;uage and Literature has the remaining 15. Financially the fre:::hmen. have accumulated a total of $14,650 in scholar:::hips which is distributed among;;t 50 men in the class. This amount is· .the largest sum ever prevalent in the school. Over 40 members of the class have also found employment. Entering Freshmen America Asbruzzese, Herbert H. Adams, Richard M. Adams, Ed- ward C. Akerly, John C. Alberts, Edward L. Allen, Albert W.

Employers tociay require practical as well as theoretical' experience. The L'nion College Concordiensis offers the unique opportunity to gain practical experience in joumalism and advertising. The Concordiensis is operated on the same basis as any large newspapet·, but naturally on a smaller scale. The college newspaper now occupies a position midway be- tween an activity and a caree1·. Although organized and managed by a non-professional board, the paper, and espe- cially the business bom·d, deals with professionals. In a ma- jority of cases college nevvspapers are dependent upon the income from advet'tising, national and local, to supplement circulation revenue and insure profitable operation. This has not always been the case, however. For years the campus paper was a handmaiden of charity, and the ad- vertising which it carried was of the \drag\ variety.

Class Struggles Will Start Soon Emile Brunet to Head Sophomore Discipline Committee of I 0 Men Caper-cutting freshmen will have their capers cut when sophomores dip their curly locks, according to an announcement ·by President Dixon Ryan Fox today. Dr. Fox said that the same rule which applied to freshman haircuts last year will be continued. Sopho- more Discipline Committee mem- bers may award free hair·cuts to errant neophytes but they must be administered by the college barber. The Discipline Committee, which was appointed ·by Sophomore Pres- ident William L. Wilkin of Sche- nectady Saturday, began enforcing three freshman rules yesterday. Composed of representatives of fraternities, dormitories, and non- resident students, the committee in- cludes: Emile Brunet, chairman; Harlan Buckland, Archibald A. Smith Jr., Thomas J. Connor, Oli- ver R. Houghton, Kenneth Sharpe, Robert Horton, Henry Wysocki, William Shat key and Everett Mc- Carty. The committee will direct the ·Class of 1943 in enforcing- three rules for freshmen. Men will be posted· in Memorial Chapel each day to see that freshman retain their seats until upper classmen have filed out of daily assembly. \They will also check on whether freshmen wear their caps. Third rule to be enforced is that no fresh- man may wall{ on the grass. Frosh who are caught painting the Idol will also be punished by the discipline committee. The Class of 1944 will have an opportunity to break away from some of this restraint in the annual Sophomote vs. Freshman cane rush. Professor Wilford H. Ketz, chairman of the committee on class activities, said today that tentative plans call for the cane rush and a tug-of-war over the college brool{ on November !J. ----a---- Glee Club to Sponsor Famed Paris Organist Joseph Bonnet, Parisian organist now making his ninth tour of the United States and Canada, will give a concert in Memol'ial chapel Octo- ber 11 under the auspices of the Glee club. This will be the fifth Glee club concert and its proceeds will go to the club:s fund for a new piano. Marcel Dupre was presented by the club in 1937 and last year. In 1934 Gunther Ramin played here. Bonnet was bot'n in Bm·deaux. At the age of 14 ·he was appointed organist of the Church of St Michael. Later he became a pupil of Guilmant at the Paris Conservatory. He afterwards succeeded to the post of organist at St. Eustache in Paris. At Guilmant's death in 1911, he succeeded him at the Paris Con- servatory. The six volumes of Bonnet's \Historical Organ Recitals\ consti- tute his greatest contribution to musical liter-ature. Following his successes in this country, Bonnet received the Knighthood of the Legion of Honor from his mother country. Ph ilo1natheans Arrange PJog:ra~m For Coming Y ea.r Group to Participate In l,nferco'llegiate Debate, Public Forums Three major phases of activity wiN mat·k the pr0gr:tm of the Phil- om~thea;n Society for the coming year, it was announced last night by Rogu D. Marshall '41, president of the gt oup, at the conclusion of the Society's first meeting of the year. Marshall Indicated that, in addition to carrying on its program of intercollegiate debate, the club plans to expand the program of bi- weekl:.: night forum meetings at which prominent figures both from the campus and the surrounding area will be present at several points in the year. The Philomathean·s president further added that, in its third sphere of activity, the club would take an increasingly active part i.n public forum programs, both at the college and in such organizations as the Schenectady Public Forum . Further opportunity for this ty.pe of a-ctivity which was chatacterized by the group's presentation of a round table debate over station WGY during the pa.st academic year was a natural result of last year's success with an experimen- tal program of J.ike nature, Mar- shall indicated. Rent>w Dt>bate System At the same time, it was an- nounced by John A. Ruskowski, '41, manager of debate, that the system ·of round table debate which was instituted at Union last year would be continued. This system which has the feature of enabling speak- ers representing the same· college to disagree with each other's V·iews on the measure under debate has received a great deal of favorable comment fro·m various sources, Ruskowski declared. The manager or debate f·urther announced that from fourteen to fifteen debates in addition to at- tendance at approximately four conferences would be scheduled for the year. The official debate pr·o- gram will begin in the latter part of October, Ruslwwski said. Dr. Douglas W. Campbell, ad- viser to the group, in his comment upon the plans that the group has adopted for the year indicated his wish to emphasize the new position that the Philomathean Society has .come to assume in the past two years ·with sponsorship of intercol- legiate de·bate ·being but one of three activities of the group. Dr. Oampbell stressed the importance of these other two act·ivities; name- ly, an active rogram at the club's bi-weekly meeting, and the expan- tContihued on Page 4) Radi,o Workshop To Outline P:la:ns For Third Season Mills Contemplates Expansion of Program On Standard Waves The Union College Radio Work- shop will inaugurate its third sea- ~on Monday night when a group of students most prominent in last year's pr0gram meet in Silliman Hall to form an executive c0mmit- tee and di::;cuss plans for the 1940-41 season. InBtrumental in ca:lling Monday's meeting has been Myron Mills, '12, Eecretary of the Workshop last year, who has tempvral\ily been as- ~igned the duties of chairman. He said last night that the organiza- tion is already considering an ex- pansion which would put its pro- grams on standard broadcast waves in addition to the General Elictric Compan.y's international stations, WGEA and WGEO. The club has also received invitation·s to present I its programs over WGY and the Albany stations, WOKO and WABY. Arrangements were made to ob- tain scripts from the radio depart- ment of the United States Office of Education by Mr. Milton M. En- zer, '2!), alumni adviser, while he was in Washington two weeks ago. The Radio Workshop will also use scripts submitted by Un,jon stu- dents. Last year three undergrad- uates' works were used in the or- ganiza·tion's broadcasts. Criticism Favorable So many favorable· criticisms were received from colleges during the summer on the ''From the Campus\ feature, an educational program conducted by Paul Ma- honey, '40, chairman of the Radio Workshop during 1939-40, that the group w.ill continue the program this season on both short and long wave. Correspondence with over 100 colleges is being maintained to obtain material for \From the Campus.\ programs. Gordon ·semet'ad, '42, and Mills will also carry on their program, \Collegians View the Films,\ which was originated last year. This\ se- ric3 will be presented over the General Electric short wave sta- tions. The date for a general meeting, at which new members will be re- ceived, will be set by the executive committee Monday. Mills stated that the Worl{shop included 40 ac- tive members last year, 20 of whom participated in actual broadcasts. Students interested in announcing, acting, t•adio-direction, script-writ- ing, sound effects and commentat- ing are requested to register their names in the News Bureau office, where the Radio Workshop cards a.re filed. President Fox Inaugurates Series Of 43 \American Faith\ lecturers Speaks in Chapel Fox's War Refuge Offer Praised by St. Andrews An offer extended by Union College to receive· members of the families of the faculty of St. Andrews Univers.tty for the dur- ation of the war has been offi- cially noted by the University Comt in a letter to Dr. Fox. The letter reads: \I am dit·ected by the Univer- sity Court of the University of St. Andrews to expre:>s to your college the gratitude and thanks of the Court for the offer which you have so very kindly made to receive members of the families of the Univet\sity Professoriate and Staff whom it may ·be found desirable to send out of this country during the period of the present war. The Univers·ity Court is very sensible of the spirit of friendliness in which this offer has been made and value it highly a;; an evidence of moral support in the struggle in which this country is presently engaged.\ The letter is signed by the secretary of the Univer- sity Court. Employment Training To Be Given by Bureau Flays Debunkers; Defends Colleges In Chapel Speech President Dixon Ryan Fox to- day inaugurated a series of 43 chapel assembly talks by member·s of the faculty and several distin- guished visitors to its ~taff whic·h is entitled \The American Faith\ because this \implies that the pos- sibilities of American life have not all been realized, but it indicates that our past reaosures us that they can be t·ealized and that the great American society is devoted to that end.\ Delivering the first address, en- titled \Reaffirmation today, Dr. Fox explained why the faculty out- lined the ·series of addres:;es, to ·be given before the entire student body about three times out of each we·ek's five assemblies; \We do not want you to forget that this Re- public is a sple·ndid and beneficent enterp~ise, that it exists not sdmply for the benefit of its pre:;ent citi- zens. or even for the infinite pro- ceosion that is to follow after; it exists and goes forward for the benefit of mankind.\ Blames Historians Dr. Fox, ·himself a historian of American life, charged that \de- bunkers\ among historians who ·sought to emphasize the \blem- ishes\ ln. their books in their desire to prefent \something new\ as be- ing responsible for blurring \our vision of the benefits that Ameri- can life has given and is giving to every one of us, the grateful and sacrificial loyalty that naturaHy follows, and the duty that member- ship in such a nation entails upon each citizen to carry on its. best for the good of all posterities to follow,\ Beginning with the ''muck-rak- ers\ who thirty years ago were just finishing \a clinical study of disease in certain parts of the body politics, and with easy generaliza- tion some inferred that the whole body was bad,\ there grew fashion- able a group of historians who sought to \correct\ our history. Dr. Fox said that \to make room for the discussion of contemporary problems, books neglected the dis- cussion of root-principles which had been planted with such de- voted care by the fathers of this nation, as if those problems could be solved save by the strength that came from those root-principles.\ Educators Defended Letter Written By First President Prized Acquisition of Library The student employment bureau is completing anangements for training students to serve in a type of Job ft equently available but for which onl;y •·experienced' help has bePn wanted. Miss Frances Travis, director of the ·bureau, in announc- ing the plans for this year:s aid to students earning their college ex- penses, said that a group of them will be trained to assist at private parties in var·ious capacities, as butlers, to serve dinner, aid in its preparation, and to clean up after- wards. The president then took up the charge made by some that the \temporary faltedng in our Amer- ican confidence\ is due to the col- leges. He said that \if anyone would take the trouble to t•eview the bibliographies of the past two decades he would see that the not- able apostles of irresponsibility and despair have generally stood outside the colleges. If youth has occasionally been deluded by them, so has middle age. Should we ex- pect youth to be so much wiser and braver than we have been? The whole fraternity of this nation needs to take a full round view of American life, compare It with the life that was lived by any great group in times past, or that is be- ing lived in any oth·er part of the world. That view will go far to re- storing our conviction that here is man's best hope.\ by JOHN P. LEWIS Yesterday afternoon Librarian Helmer Webb, cornered in Nott Memorial office and admitting that he did have something of interest fat· the Concordiensis, extracted a cardboard packet from a camoufla- ged tile. There emerged a weather- beaten bit of correspondence re- inforced with linen gauze, Mt·. Webb's proudest acquisition of the summer, considet·ed to ·be \the most impcrtant single document in the college archives.\ The letter is one from John Blair Smith, first President of Union, dated Schenectady, July 2, 1798, und dispached to a clerical colleague in Virginia. The significance and value of the letter is naturally in large part limited. to this college; consequently Mr. Webb found him- self on a peculiar bargaining basis when faced with a crafty former owner. However after a competent piece of dickering the deal was completed. It is Mr. Webb's dis- tinct suspicion that this is not the first time that the manuscript has been the property af the college. President Smith was an extremely literature gentleman, apparently had his ',;eminary'- as he calls it- well at his fingertips, and sets out to describe the acedemic situation in Schenectady in a systematic way. At the time the college employed a faculty of fom·: a pt\Ofessor of mathematics, Latin and Greek; a Dutchman, Professor Vanden Heu- val, late of the University of Ley- den, who taught natural philosophy and astronomy; the dominie of the local reformed church, who seems to have been odd-job man, and the President. Along with his adminis- hative duties, Smith found time to teach histot·y, chronology, logic, metphysics, moral philosophy, and the United States Constitution. The lettet· enters into a iong cat- alogue of the scientific and math- leal equipment of the institut01'. The labt·atories boasted a small telescope and a planetarium-\a very elegant instrument which cost 2 guineas.\ The surprising fact is the listed cost of the equipment, £200. That was a lot of money in the 1790's. Apparently Smith anct his trustees realize this, for it seems that tuition has just been raised from $16 to $20 per annum. There- upon it is added, \It is $36 at Princeton.\ This type of service is in demand, but private hostesses have wanted experienced help in the past. Through a \short course\ of tutor- ing, it is expected that at least ten or twelve young men will be avail- able for such jobs by the end of September. The students are seeking oppor- tunities for work in three main classifications: wor]{-in-return-for- board, work-in-return-for-a-room, and \odd jobs\ which includes work of every description, from fer- tilizing lawns to cler·king in stores. A detailed account of a student's qualifications together with an in- dication of need for work is sent to an employer who is also asl{ed aftet ward, by personal telep·hone or letter, to comment on the satisfac- tory manner in which a student is fulfilling his duties. Last year of The first prexy's words for his 1 more than 600 jobs filled by stu- charges ate succinct and pointed: I dents only four replies from em- \The manners of the students and players indicated that there was the townspeople are as yet pretty anything lacking on the part of the plain and simple.\ students. Admits Colleges' Error But he also admitted that \in one respect our colleges are open to a charge. Dul'ing the past twenty years, particularly, we have taken the fundamental soundness of America for granted and have concentrated our concern upon practices that ought to be remedied. We have, we admit, tried to jog you out of your complacency. We do not think that we have upset your balance. We do not resign our duty to point out, from time to time, injustices and inefficien.ces in our national life that cry loud for correction. We do not come before you with apologies, or any confession that we have sinned against the truth. But we do s·ay that in our anxiety to improve our country we have, perhaps, busied ourselves too exclusively with cer- tain parts of the truth.\

Fitz included the fact that Ed Eustice, a probable starter at the plunging spot itt the Garnet backfield on Saturday, who suffered an injury to the muscles of his shoulder last week, is practically \as good as new,\ and ready to- go again in l'egular practice sessions. Team Studies Movies A large portion of time this week will be devoted to polishing off rough edges, as was evidenced yes- terday, when Nitchman went through an intensive signal drills with the \C\ Team, while Ciampa 'ironed out blocking assignment difficulties with the ... \A\ and \B\ gr·oups. Contin.uing a practice which he started J.ate last s·eason, Nitchman is making considerable use of moving pictures, taken at practice sessions, and shown -to the entire squad for ~tudy purposes. C0ach Nitchman is not as yet ready to disclose a lineup on -which he would be willing to \stand pat\ until Saturday. The large gaps in the line caUEed by graduation are demanding considerable attention before a definite starting lineup can be decided upon. Witll the pos- sibility of Enstice being unabl,, to etart eliminated, the backfield problem is much simpler, with Jack Vannier, Balch and George Norris apparently having the in- side track for the other three back- field positions. -----0------ INTRAMURALS Footbaii Re;;ults North College 0, Theta Delta Chi 22; Delta Upsilon 0, Kappa Sigma 6; Beta Theta Pi 0, Chi Psi 6.

The known schedule to date: Lacrosse Squads In Daily Fall Practice Varsity and freshman lacrosse squads are hard at work, daily practicing fundamentals on Li- brary Field, according to Fred Wyatt, the recently appoin-ted var- sity coach. At present the helmets are being reconditioned, making scrimmage imposs-ible. However, simple drilling in picking up loose balls, throwing, catching, dodging and blocking take up most of the time. Each practice eession culmi- na-tes in a twenty-minute game of \keep-away which, according to Coach Wyatt, proves very interest- ing.

During the last six months, 3,195 alumni items have been added to the records. The Council is also making a collection of biograph- ical sketches of alumni who were born in Schoharie County.

Individual Discussions To Help College Meet Future Placement Need Forty members of the Union College senior class will be inter- viewed by Lewis Eldred, of Cornell University personnel department, Mcnday and Tuesday as part of an extensive survey of college personnel programs in twenty sel- ected liberal arts colleges. In 1936, Count Sfotza delivered two lectures here sponsot ed by the Ichabod Spencer foundation, speak- ing on \The Future of Democracy in Europe\ and \The International Situation in Europe.\ He will stay in the fellow's chamber of Hale House during his semester long visit.

Wednesday evening, he will deliver his first public lecture and on Thursday evening he will meet with the In- ternational Relations Club. The rest of Count Sforza's program has not as yet been announced. Eligibility rules for Union stu- dents, prepared .by Dean Charles F. F'. Garis, permit more students to apply for these federal scholar- ships than was the case last fall. This has particular reference to students who are working their way through college. Last year such students were not permitted to apply. But this fall, \students who work to help defray their college expenses may be de·clared eligible if it is felt that they can carry thE> C. A. A. course. All cases will be investigated.\ \Not eligible to apply for sch- olarships will be f1·eshmen and all students on scholarship warning. Students not on scholarship wa·rn- ing, but not on the deans list, will be requil·ed to choose this course as their only extra-curricular act- ivity for the duration of the course.\ In regard to the much discussed \military pledge\ which appeared on the application blanks for pilot training scholarships, Dr. Peter I. Wold, designated as coordinator of Civilian Pilot Training at Union College, received this telegraphed interpretation from the federal C. A. A.: This <the military pledge) is not intended to set the time of circumstance for military service. It is simply a statement of intention to use training in national defense.\ Military Clause Explained Dr. Wold stated that -this tele- gram makes it clear that the mil- itary clause does does not imply \joining the army,\ or sacrificing one's self to summary call for military training. It is for the stu- dent to determine the time artd circumstance of his application for further training after receiving his pilot's licence from the C. A. A. The Ground School course in con- nection with the C. A. A. program here is scheduled to begin October 1, or as soon thereafter as possible. Dr. Wold explained last night that the flight training will commence at the Schenectady airport imme- diately after the start of the ground school. The staff of Ground School in- structors will include Professor Russell A. Hall, Professor Everett W. Thatcher and Professor Robert L. Stanley. Classes w!ll be held on three nights each week for 12 weeks in the lecture room of the Physics laboratory. James Lee Ellenwood, Speaker Oswald Heck Discussion Leaders James Lee Ellenwood, D. D., sec- retary of the New York State YMCA, and Oswald D. Heck, '24, speaker of the New York State Assembly, will speak on \What Are the Spiritual Resources of America,\ as the Empire State Town Meeting inaugurates its third series of discussion debates from the Old Chapel Sunday afternoon. WGY will again broadcast the meetings from 3:15 to 3:45. The issue this Sunday hinges on the issue of whether the church and family are able to effectively maintain morale in the present and impending national crisis of de- fense or whether the state must step in. Dr. Ellenwood will speak on behalf of such agencies as the YMCA, the church and other pri- vate organizations, upholding the belief that they can cope with the present situation. Formerly pastor of the Trinity Methodist Church of Schenectady. Dr. Ellenwood has been secretary of the New York State YMCA for 15 years. Mr. Heck will present the view that the government must help other agencies in bolstering morale. The Graduate Council is also actively interested in the affairs of the student body and it has helped several of the leading stu- dent activities: such as the Moun- tebanks, the Band, the Outing Club, the Christian Association, the Radio and the Glee Club, the booklet says. At its spring meeting, the Council appropriated $3,600 as a contribut- ion toward the riew drainage and sprinkling system on Alexander field. Following the business meeting Saturday, the council members will attend a luncheon at Hale House. Later in the afternoon, they will watch the football game between Union and Haverford. Union's cheering will be led by: Jake Van Aernam, '42, John Baas, '42, James Pinkston, '42, Robert Gillie, '43, Don Beal, '44, Sam Trull, '44, and Tom Han- igan, '44.

Aftet· serving as pastor of the First Congregational Church of Oakland, Calif., from 1896 to 1911, the Rev. Dr. Brown was elected dean of the Divinity School of Yale University, serving until 1928 when he was made dean-emeritus. He has done much professional study in Egypt and Palestine and has lectured on ethics at Yale, Cornell, Columbia and Harvard. Ac- tive in church a:airs·, he is the au- toh of a large number of religious books. Kenneth E. Mackenzie, '41, of South Orange, N. J., was elected president of the Interfraternity Council at the first meeting of the year held Tuesday. The council also named Paul V. Mara, '41, as Sec retary-Treasurer. The principal business confront ing the council, as it embarked on its 1940-41 program, were the arran gements for the annual Interfrat ernity Gridiron Ball, which will be held in the Alumni Gymnasium on Friday, November 15, the night previous to the final football game of the season with Hamiliton. The new president called a second meet ing of the council for Tuesday night when definite plans will ·be outlined and the committees appointed to handle the dance. Because the council did not elect a president to succeed David G. Hayner last spring, Dickinson E. Griffith, Jr., acted as temporary chairman of the first meeting until the election of Mackenzie.

But here we must catch ourselves in our retrospection to heed a word of warning. L'nion's team and its coaches are to be highly praised for the nearly perfect record of a season ago. But, recmd or no record, this year's Gamet team will be judged on its own merits, not on those of last year's squad. It will be hard for those of us who are not out on the field to console ourselves with anything but another string of victories this season. It will be so easy to criticize a team 'vhich must fill the shoes of last year's greats •.. a team which might possibly find those shoes a size too large. Om· warning is to those whose expectations will be far be- ~·ond all reason. To those who will expect nothing but vic- tories; who will expect Union to have anothel' \Little All- Amel'ican\ and who will be satisfied with nothing less, we urge a reconsideration. It is not our purpose to pl'edict the future of Union's 1940 football team. Whether it will equal last season's undefeated squad, exceed the record set a year ago, o1· fail to approach that record in any respect, onb· time will tell.

Union is no exception and the Dutchmen will line up against Havetford College on Mont Pleasant High Schoo'l Field at 2 p. m., for their initial game of the 1940 gridiron season. The Pennsylvanians will travel·~ to Schenectady with a fairly smaH squad of twenty-tht·ee men, 0nly five of them lettermen who saw action against Union last fall, Captain Jeff Hemphil, Sam Snipes, Bob Miller, Gary Winslow and Jimmy Magill. Advance pt·ess no- tices from Haverford say the Fot dmen suffered heavy losses .by graduation, but are looking for- ward to a successful season. Sev- et·al of the upperclassmen have shown improvement, according to Coach Roy Randall, and the fresh- man class has furnished several excellent players. Heavy Haverford Line •The Ha ver!ord team will be led by Captain Hemphil from his po- sition at left guard. Hemphil has had three years' experience on the varsity and has shown himself to be a great leader. Opposite him at the other guard position will be Jack Webb, another senior. The tackle slots will be occupied by Jack Frazier and the gigantic T0m cocheran, 260 pounds on the cleate. Lettermen Sam Snipes and Bob Miller will be at the ends of the line while Lee Childs will be in the center slot. The Haverford line is fairly heavy, the average being 182. The heaviest man is Tommy Cochran, tackle, 260, and the light- est being Jack Webb at guard. The backfield quartet of the Pennsylvanians; ave rag i n g 161 pounds per man, consists of Jimmy Magill, George Warner, Scotty Wor- ral and Gary Winslow. Magill, a hard running line plunger, is the only letterman in this backfield and will carry the brunt of the pig- skin lugging and passing. Gary Winslow, the hardest hitter on. the team, will be in the blocking back post and will do the kicking for the team. George Warner, the light- est man on the team, tipping the scale·s at 142, is the climax runner, while Scotty Worral will receive plenty of passing and blocking as• signments. \A Tossup,\ Says Nels Coach Nitchman is not expecting an easy afternoon such as last year's. On the contrary, he states the game, in his m.nd, is any man's from the opening whistle. He said that last year's squad had de· veloped much quicl{er than this year s team, and that was the rea- son for the 41-16 score. Nels pointed out that .,despite the fact that Haverford was, totally unprepared for the opener last year and much further behind in development, they managed to score more points than any of our other opponents. Furthermore, when they reached their peak, they gave Lehigh a good battle before they lost to the Engineers, 20-13. With these things in view, Nels gives the Dutchmen an even chance and no one the edge. Nitchman's lineup for the cur- tain raiser tomorrow will find Die!{ Dalch at his old quarterback spot ready for his afternoon of blocking assignments, Co-Captain Jack Van- nier at tailback, George Norris at wingback and Ed Enstice at the number three spot in the backfield. Enstice is the only newcomer to the backfield this year, but even he had plenty of experience under- study.ing Hammer&trom last season. Nels is expecting a lot from Van- nier this season. So far in practice he appears to be headed for his best season. He has. picked up a bit more speed and this· with his newly acquired art of \cutting\ should make hir::~ a more dangerous run- ner than ever. As a runner, and the outstanding passer and punter on the team, he may emerge as a real triple threat back. Dick Balch, playing his third season of varsity ball, will be in their despite the bruises he picked up this week in practice. Dick, a heady play calier and hard hitting blocker, is the spark of the backfield. George Nor- ris, fast and clever runner, and En- stice, who will be depended upon for hard earned yardage through the line, round out a fast and rugged backfield. Sawyer at Center Co-Captain Jack Guibert, strong defensive end, and Diamond Ma- rotta, who with Vannier look like a flashy. aerial combination, will be at left and right end, respe.c- tively. Tiny Weintraub and Dtuch Dorsman, 400 pounds total, have received the nod for the tackle slots. The s,crappy Bobby Baker and hardhitting Adam Ciesinski will pair up at the guard posts, while Bud Sawyer will be at the pivot post. Haverf0rd is expected to make a lot of use of a oversbifted line and an undershifted backfield as its standard defensive formation. It employed this forma:tion last ye,ar with some success. On the offens.ive it makes use of a varied single wing formation with the number two back in motion. When the back is not in .motion, however, watch for plenty of deceptive hidden ball stuff. The plays which they gained the most ground with last year, and which they will probably try to capitalize on tomorrow are a faked pass resulting in an end run, and a delayed pass to left end.

Lawrence ex- pressed some optimi·sm in t·egard to the season's prospects but said that the squad was hampered by lack of time and also by a lack of experienced reserves. \With continued hard work, the defense shouldn't .be bad,\ Law- -rence said, \but the offense needs plenty of work, especially on tim- ing. If this comes around all right and the squad continues to show the same spirit it has Ehown to date, we should have a fairly good season.\ Lawrence said he believed he had one fairly experienced team but that the reserves would have to be built up and that this would take plenty of work and plenty of time. He particularly praised the spirit of the entire squad which he describ- ed as \very very good.\ Top Left: Winslow, !. Hemphil, r. Center: Snipes. Bottom: Warner, I. Magil, r.
