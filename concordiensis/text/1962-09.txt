Atlv:isar ln the Interest of Union President Davidson suggests i11 his letter to the s~u­ dents that they rise to meet the challenge of a p~gr?ess1~e school. But just what and who is to be progressive . It IS true that the Aims Program now being released .forms .a wonderful backdrop for a schOol ready to change. But IS Union? We think not. In a continuation of past Con- col'diensis policy, this column will feature articles by members of the faculty and administration. In accordance with his position as President of the college, Dr. Da- vidson was requested to initiate the 1962-63 school year with the following article. By Carter Davidson Our 1962 Faculty Retreat, held September 9, 10, 11 at South Lee, Massachusetts, attracted over a hundred staff members and re- sulted in a very stimulating dis- cussion (no holds barred) of the The school envisioned in the reports is a ficticious one. It is not the type of scbool either the trustees, ~eg­ ments of the administration, or most alumni want. It 1s a school that looks good for the Ford Foundation, and so echoes only the thoughts of the faculty. Actions of the school are directly contradictory to its aims. Sure it is good to have an Honors Program. We've more tha~ o~ce praised the trustees and administration for establ~shmg one But whom are you setting it up for? Accordmg to reports of last year's Task Forces, the. administration, the \Report on Admissions\ simp~y and especially of the image or ref .lects the nrese\t high-calibre admissions policy. If this \climate\ or personality of Union !:' n College as it reflected in our pur- is so then we are seeking the \exceptional\ students. Yet poses and programs. When I re- \re w' .e~? ..

Only a highly tirely worn off, and wrote the fot- l .ntellectual and curious group of students will. Our present lowing as my. interpretation of d what the faculty seemed . to be admissions policy is one marked by bigotry, stupi~~ty, .an saying tli.ey wanted to create 11 t utter disregard for what should be the aim of Uruon,. th.e Union. The question I put to the I students is: Do you want to be a improvement of its academic distinction an~ . nam~ ~ t 15 member of this kind of college? characteristic that one member of the admllllstratwn re- ma~ked somewhat incredulously \do you want us to be like Swarthmore?\ The admissions department will readily admit that <lertain freshmen are admitted as. \red light cases,\ people who are not expected to make it through the first year. Some surprise the school. They remain to graduate. So what? They're not helping the academic enviromnent at all. And if they're being admitted for .their football prowess, they probably won't last in s;Phoollong enough to play. The College for Future Explorers When America was discovered in 1492, this event triggered a thriHing series of discoveries, ex- plorations, conquests, and settle~ ments which opened the Western Hemisphere. The minqs of men were so stimulated that the fine arts began to flourish, literature blossomed out with Spenser and Shakespeare in England, Cerv!;ltl.- tes in Spain, Rabelais and Mon- taigne in France, and science took a great leap forward. As we of today look back upon those cen- turies we call them \The Renais- ,;ance,\ and think how exciting it must have been to be a member of Queen Elizabeth I's court, as a poet put it: would seem to fit it in a remark- aale fashion to play thts role. Here, under the leadership of America's most creative educator, .I:!..Hpha!et l'.o.tt, the College one Hundred and futy years ago pion- eereum ev·~ry fiela-the introd,uc- tlOll of modern toreign languages, of Amencan history and govem.- meht, of cnemlstry and tne sci~ ence laboratory to the curricu- lum; the combming of engineer- mg ana hberal arts orr the aa:me SUlall campus so that each would l:>.rengthen the other; and the 10unamg or social fraternities w1th tne1r still unreahzed poten- tial.

To Pioneer Again The time has now arrived for Unron College to pwneer agam in higher education. its educational paLtern for· the past fifty years has provided it w1th an exception- ally strong base 1n mathematics and the sciences, strengthened and sharpened by association wtth thetr applications in engi- neering. Engmeering at Union has a1 ways been \applied science\ rather than \shopwork and the mtroductwn of electronic com- puters and atomic theory has come about without strain. But the faculty has never allowed the liberaL ans to run a poor second, and the Humanities staff are ex- perimentmg with methods of ~eaching effective writing of Eng- lisn as well as the integrated speaking-listening-reading - writ- mg of toreign languages; the So- cial Studies staff have boadened tneir scope to include Asia, Afri- ca, and Latin America in their study of history, economics, and sociology, and have used the. state governmental bureaus in Albany, the feder11l in Washington, and the world's in New York as labor- atories for intensive observation and research. Research-minded Faculty The entire faculty, stimulated undoubtedly by sabbatical leaves, grants from the National Science _b!oUJidation, th13 Fulbright Aet, · and other govel'IUiient agencies, has become research-minded. For example, every member of our de- partment of Biology is deeply in- volved in basic research, and the Great was it in that day to be eleven professors in Physics (all alive, of whom possess the Ph.D de- Political A.ffairs·- Paperbac The Boys at Syracuse By David Berenson It has been '·said that in the game of baseball you can't tell the players without a scorecanl. A similar .situation exists if you want to attend a convention. '1 he faces, ideas, and influence of the leading figures in the party should be studied well in advance of the time the convention meets. For example, a thorough know- ledge of the Democratic Party in New York State wo1:1.ld have helped an observer at the recent Democratic Convention in S~a­ cuse. This year's events had theh· roots in the Democratic Conven- tion of four years ago. At that tim~, Boss Carmine DeSapio ferced his candidate for govei'.lior, Frank Hogan, on the convention over the protests of Herbert Leh- man, Eleanor Roosevelt, and other fighters for good govern- ment. Because of all the evil things he had done and because he wears dark glasses, thus cre- ating the image of a typical boss, a group of reformer·s banded to- gether to l'id the party oJ th:s malignant influence. Wagne1· B:~osts Ref<mn The reformers did nvt se.m to be making much headway unbl they received an unexvected bvlSt from Mayo1· Robert i''.. \~ agner, Jr. last year. W :..gner >vas L11.,:; \lble to run for re-election prom- :sing that he would clean lip the mess that his administration itself had made. With his supp01 t, the Lehman-Roosevelt group was able to \return the Democratic party to the people.\ Having successfully cleaned up Manhatten, the reformers moved to do the same in the Bronx by i'emoving Boss Charlie Buckley. Buckley was able to successfully weather the storm this year, but Lehman and Wagner vowed not to rest until they had installed new leadership ih the Bronx. With this background in mind, let us explore the candidates who had announced their availability for the gubernatorial nomination when the convention opened. First to toss his hat into the ring was ~am Stratton, well-known as a Republjcan killer h. these parts })ut little known down-state. Then there was Howard Samuels whose chief assets seemed to be that he had a Rockefeller-like personal 117 Mohawk Ave. SCOTIA, N.

Why should only 14 students out of 200 be admitted from New York City, while over half the population of the state re- sides there. A fellow from Amsterdam, N. Y. is not suffi- ciently different from one from Albany, that \geographical distribution\ can justify his acceptance over superior stu- dents from New York. In fact technically, the 10% quota does not even limit New York City acceptances. Since it consists of 5 couRties, 5Wr of the enteri.n,g class can come from there. This of course wol.lld be as ridiculous as the present policy, where sor;. of the New York State enroll- ment comes from the more sparsely populated upstate area.

Almost fifty men were present, and the spirit which they dis- pl!J.yed was impressive. Coach Allison considers this. one of the best teams whlch he has seen to da,te, and look& for a good season. The problems are many in freshman footb.all. M.~Y boys are unfamiliar with the Union sys- tem, and not only mUst they mas- ter the new ways, but they need to forget the old methods. This 1 becomes as basic as relearning the names of the various formations. Also, new plays and blocking rules must be :learned, Finally, a new atmosphel'e must be absorbed. Another problem in freshman football is one shared with all of ~he other fall sports: time. Thet first game is at home on Octobei' 13 against Wesleyan. This means that there is less than a month to sharpen up the skills which have lain dormant over the summer and, at the same time, learn )i new system.

W!Nl'<E '3-l.. ................................. . A Liberal Education The Editorial Board of Concordiensis, speaking for what we believe to be the overwhelming view of the stu- dents, faculty, and administration of Union College, con- demns the recent actions of Governor Ross Barnett and the Mississippi State Legislature in defying the will of the Courts and the Federal Government of the United States. We believe that Governor Barnett can produce no valid legal or moral justification of his position. The current situation has not been caused by James Meridith who has sought to be admitted to the University of Mississippi. It has not been caused by the United States Marshalls who have attempted to enroll Meridith as ordered by the courts. It has not been caused by the officials of the University who probabaly would have admitted Mere- dith if left unhampered by the Governor. The blame rests squarely on Governor Barnett for invoking the outworn doctrine of \interposition.\ The defense given by those in Mississippi for Barnett's action is that he is attempting to uphold the American virtue of states l'i.ghts. Barnett attacks \outsiders\ for meddling in Mississippi's affairs. Cerainly we are meddling and we will continue to do so until the citizens of the United States attain the rights reserved for them in the Constitu- tion. Human rights is more important than the legislative concept of states rights. We call on our fellow students at Mississippi to uphold what is left of the good 1'1ame of their University and to make known their opposition to the unjustified actions of their governor. Road To Recovery The only thing surprising about the 59-29 vote by the faculty was that the fraternities were able to muster as much support as they did. Though the vote is meaningless, it points out the chronic paradox of the fraternity system at Union: It is no longer compatible with the aims and ideals of the college, yet remains unchallenged. Under these conditions it is gratifying to see that the fraternities are attempting to clean house themselves. The new Inter-Fraternity Council under Ken Payment is off to a good start in its attempts to improve the fra- temity system, something more ambitious and important than his predecessors feeble attempt to merely improve its image. This action is mirrored in the alterations in the rushing rules and Hell Week established at the end of last year. It is now important however, to increase the impetus, by abolishing Hell Week altogether, wot>Jting concertedly in an attempt to bolster the constantly failing fraternity indices, and adopting the proposed cooperative food buying arrangement. These policies, if carried through, could give new life to a failing system, academically, ethically, and economically. An Appraisal The Concordiensis has always supported President Da- vidson's proposed calendar change, and so is gratified by the keen faculty interest shown towards it. Though not a radical new departure not in operation in other schools al- ready, it can still present the disruption of the presently staid curriculum necessary for Union's progress. We urge the student body, as well as the Student Council, to give it careful consideration, for they alone can suggest to the faculty just how much a load can be carried in the limited time periods specified, for there are many problems yet to b_e ironed out. What for example will take the place of win- ter recess as the traditional \paper writing\ period, what happens to those courses that need two full semesters for completion of their work, and how can a year course of any real merit be completed in just six weeks as has been pro- posed? The real beauty of the calendar of course lies in its possibilities for honors work, especially in the form of group excursions. We continue to support the proposed calendar revis- ions, but hope both the faculty and students give it, and all its ramifications, careful consideration before embracing it as a panacea for all of Unions ills. \CaiJtiviting Plants Abound at the Arboretum\ Letters to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: May I take advantage of the \Letters to the Editor\ section of the Concordiensis to remind the students of Union College that the deadline for filing applica- tions for Fulbright awards and other foreign study programs is October 15. Since all patts of the application, including letters of recommendation, must be in my hands by this date, I should like to urge all interested students to pick up application forms imme- diately. Although only graduating sen- iors are eligible for most of these competitions, it occurred to me that many juniors might well wish to acquaint themselves with the opportunities for foreign study. It seems that each year new and exciting possibilities are added to the more usual list of European programs. This year, for example, grants are available for study in Latin America, Po- land, Yugoslavia, Rumania, and Israel, to mention some of a long list of countries. Since most pro- grams r·equire some language pro- ficiency, it would seem especially advantageous for juniors, who have two years left in which to fill possible language gaps, to discover for themselves the exist- ing opportunities. I should be pleased to discuss foreign study programs with any- one interested. W. H. Oldenbrook, Union College Fulbright Advisor The author of the following let- ter, Peter Y. Sussman, spent last year in Scotland as Union's ex- change student to St. Andrews University. To the Editor of Concordiensis: This semester, for the first time in years, there is no St. An- drews University student study- ing at l:nion under the twenty- seven year-old exchange program with the Scottish university. This has led to a number of inquiries about the current and future status of the program. I should like to use your columns to as· sure the student body of the con· tinning St. Andrean interest ir. this exchange and to assess somE of the difficulties facing prospec· tive St. Andrews exchange stu- dents. Respect for the exchange exists on both student and administra- tive levels at St. Andrews. Stu- dent ties are largely personal in origin, each year's Union student forming a circle of friends, who gain through him an interest in Union and in subsequent Union students. The Union student is expected in October, and an American accent often draws a \You must be the Union student\ greeting - frequently to the em- barrassment of other American students there. Administrative re- spect for the exchange was dem- onstrated last year by the St. Andrews selection committee, which rejected all applicants be- cause none were of sufficiently high caliber for the exchange. Despite St. Andrean interest in the program, several practical problems discourage many stu- dents from applying to partici- pate. One such problem is the fi- nancial difficulty. British educa- tion at the university level is largely government- supported, and the local government \grants\ system is exceedingly generous to needy students. Thus, a year's study in Britain is relatively in- expensive. The cost of incidental living and travelling expenses for one year in the affluent society and the cost of passage to the United States frequently appear prohibitive to British students. Another deterrent to applica- tion is rooted in the British aca- demic system. The British uni- versity requires a fixed progres- sion of courses in one's major field. A course at a foreign uni- evrsity does not fit ,into the pro- gre.ssion and is not rewarded with credit toward a degree. There- fore, the exchange student from St. Andrews must always \lose\ one year on the,a:cademic ladder. Frequently too, an exchange stu- dent must interrupt a sequence of honors courses to participate. These courses are very important and lead to highly respected de- grees if intensive examinations are successfully completed. Many of the best students are reluctant for academic reasons, to apply for the exchange, much as they would welcome the opportunity to take part. The Union Coilege administra- tion is sensitive both to the value of the exchange and to the prac- tical problems involved. It is cor- responding with St. Andrews in attempts to remove or minimize the barriers to apJllications from their students. The Union-St. Andrews exchange enjoys great interest in both of the sponsoring institutions and will ce1·tainly continue to be beneficial program it has been to date. \\\ Peter Y.

There, on a sprawling 110 ac1·es of slopes oved0oking the far horizons of the Schoharie Valley, an International Botanical Congress sits in continuous ses- sion. Bristle cone pines from our western mountains grow near um- brella pines from .J a pall and off there on the next knoll is a flam- ing leaf barberry, native in Ko1 ea. An assortment of 1lowe1 ing crabs from China are fruiting· heavily with the tiny apples in shades of yellow and red. You will roam naturally ter- raced plantings covering ac1 es yet made homely and intimate by enclosing field stone walls. It's hard to say when one's delight is most keenly stimulated-the view, the countryside, or the 600 kinds of exotic trees and shrubs thriving here. Certainly the com- bination is wonderful-just won- derful. Creative Curator glance around its walls and note the work of generations. of as- piring artists for whom Fred has been a kind of rural Maecenas affording an island of comfort and calm in the turbulence of their emotion packed lives. To a botanist Fred's greatest quality is the loving care that goes into his plant handling. A 1 sn~!cimeu which might be expected to die strikes root and thrives under his intuitively critical treat- ment. Heathers from Adirondack moW1tain tops and flowering shrubs flourish together under his disceming eye. Plants that nor- mally winterkiil in the latitude of New York City hav:e survived on this improbable hill, Even those that succumb to winter cold or the nibbling by deer nowise dim Fred's enthusiasm.

A list of all Fred's doings would run to book length. He is an ac- complished pianist, yet. he can shear sheep and worm the hogs. He can weave cloth or cook a roast.

Hhovel of Cleveland, Ohio. Before Mr. Shovel's discovery in 1946, all digging was done with sugar tongs-a method unquestionably dainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, natu- rally, many efforts made to speed up digging before'Mr. Shovel'R breakthrough-notably an attrmpt in 1912 by the immortal Thotnas Ah·a Edi..-;on to dig v,ith the phonogrnph, but the only thing that happened was that he gut hi::. horn full uf sand.

Edic;un that he fell into a fit of melancholy from which he did not emerge until two vears later when hifl friend William Wordsworth, the eminent ~ature poet, cheered him up by imitating a duck for four and a half hours. But I digress. For nine years, I say, I have been writing this column for the makerR of Marlboro Cigarettes, and for nine years they have been paying me money. You are shocked. You think that anyone who has taflted Marlboro's unparalleled flavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro's filter; who has revelled in Marlboro's jolly red and white pack or box should be more than willing to write about Marlboro without a penny's compensa- tion. You are V>Tong. Compensation is the very fpundation stone of the American Way of Life. Whether you loYe your work or hate it, our system absolutely require.<; that you he paid for it. For example, I have a friend named Rex Clehe, a vrterinarian hy profession, who simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up and say, \Hey Rex, let's go bowl a few lincl<,\ or \Hey Rex, let's go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,\ and he will always reply, \~o thanks. I better stay here in case somebody wants a dug wormed.\ I mean there is nut one thing in the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than worming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worm- ing your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do other- wise would be to rend, possibly irrepatably, the fabric of democracy. It's the same with me and Marlboro CigaretteR. I think Marlboro's flavor represents the pinnacle of the tobacconist's art. I think Marlboro's filter represents the pinnacle of the filter-maker's art. I think Marlboro's pack and box represent the pinnacle of the packager's art. I thinlr Marlboro is a pleaH- ure and a treasure, and I fairly hurst with pride that I have been chosen to speak for Marlboro on your campus. All the same, I want my money every week. And the makers of Marlboro u~derstand this full well. They don't like it, but they understand It. In the columns which follow. this opening installment, I will turn the hot white light of tr1J,th on the pressing problems of campus life-the many and varied dilemmas which beset the undergraduate-burning questions like \Should Chaucer class- rooms be converted to parking garages?\ and \Should proctors be given a saliva test? 1 ' and ' 1 Sl#,{mld foreign exchange students be held for ransom?\ ,, And in these columns, whiie grappling with the crises that vex campus America, I will make occasional brief mention of Marlboro Cigarettes. If I do not, the makers will not give me any money. © 1902 Max Shulman * * The makers of Marlboro will bring you this uncensored, free-style column 26 times throughout tlre school year.

The Gar- net's first opponent may very well put a crimp in Coach Joe Maras' high hopes, however, as the Larries boast a fine group of performers, led by the formidable Wally Brown, the one-man wrecking crew from the boys up north. Brown, tabbed as perhaps the most talented backfield ace the Dutchmen wiii face all season, will be ready to pick up where he left off last season against the Dutchmen, when he turned in a spark- ling 'Performance of explosive football. Brown scored the Larries' lone touchdown in St. Lawrence's losing effort to C. W. Post last weeknd, 7-6. Coach Hoffman was relectuant to release Brown's rush- ing yardage, ·but it is even. money that he picked up the lion's share of St. Lawrence's overland totals. Hoffman, who was interviewed by News Bureau Director Ed Born earlier this week via telephone, rated his charges a one point favorite ovet• the 1\Iarasmen. This margin. although slim, was based upon the home factor, the fact that St. Lawrence already has one game under its belt, and-this week's weather forecast. All indica- tions point to rain tomorrow in the north country, thus, Hoffman believes, the \Eales advantage\ will be pretty much negated. The 'Larrie mentor overlooks, however, that Eales has .proven to be an 1 ex.ce1JLional \mudder as his record against Rochester last year wi attest. The Union field general paced the Garnet to a brilliail.t 15-0 victory over one of Union's most disliked rivals. The elusive ·Mr. Eales completed 11 of 17 tosses, befuddling the Yellowjackets in the driving rainstorm that pelted Alexander Field before a damp Homecoming crowd. Coach Maras' general plan of procedure will be to utilize the strong right arm of the Sayville Slinger about ,sixty per cent of the time. St. Lawrence will counter with a strong line averagipg 1~5 lbs., about a pound per man more than the Garnet forward wall. In addition, every starter on the Larrie line has won his varsity letter, a situation that will .prove more than a challenge to Union's sophomore-speckled front-liners. A Union victory will carry a true label of \upset for several reasons. The Union attack has looked sluggish in practice, and it is evident that another week of conditioning- would help the Dutchmen considerably. The freshmen fo11ces gave a surprisingly good account of themselves this week in a scrimmage with the va11sity, using gang- tackling technique's to stop their more experienced counterparts. They also moved well against the Union color-bearers, on the ground in particular, handing out in general a large dose of abuse to the varsity forces. This fine showing, however, could serve to inspire the boys with seniority, although only tomorrow will prove it. Maras is also faced with the prospects of an injured Pete Burg· wald, the Garnet's leading rusher last season. Burgie is nursing a sore leg and may see only limited duty at Canton. Substitute quar- terback Joe Stevens is also hampered by an ailing hand and may not be able to spell Eales. Also, the presence of twenty sophomores, most of whom will see action tomorrow, will present Joe Maras with another reason to pace the floor into the small hours of to- morrow morning. Every line position sees a potential sophomore re- placement, a question mark .of some magnitude. Although painting a somewhat bleak picture of the Garnet chances, we are firmly convinced that the game should .be as close, if not closer than last year's 22-14 St. Lawrence win.

It is unfortunate that the college refuses to allow any campus organization to sponsor a bus to the away games, since football interest this year appears to de- mand it.

It is to house the foreign language, classics, and art departments. Demolition of neighboring Wash- burn Hall will begin by Thanks- giving Recess, while the Mounte- banks will be assured of Hanna Hall for their fall presentation. A motion to add the Student Council's support for the speedy adoption of the tri-semester cal- endar was defeated on the basis of the limited knowledge of the majojrity of representatives with the issue. Haines explained that the six week winter semester could possibly be devoted to trav- el, independent study or research, or to receiving a full year's credit i:rt a subject. I Clancy Brothers To Appear In further business, it was an- nounced that the Sophomore class, who will sponsor Fall Weekend, will present the Clancy Brothers, an Irish folk group, on Saturday evening, following the traditional dance on Friday night at the Van Curler. : In further new business, the ap- pointment of Lawrence McCray il:s Chairman of the Traffic Court was approved by the Council, ~long with four other regular members and one altemate. A po- sition for one additional alternate remains open. Last year, the court reviewed approximately two doz- en cases, and refunded 50% of the fines. Frosh Grid ••• (Continued from Page 5) freshmen performed well against the varsity. On Tuesday night, Coach Alli- son alternated two complete units of 11 men. This is a part of his plan to operate with two equal units instead of a first and sec- ond team. The two will get equal drilling on both offense and de- fense, and will get equal playing time in the games. Particularly outstanding in the sr immage were Bob DeMichele a11d Dick Male. Bob, playing line- backer, was to be found making almost half of the tackles. Dick, at guard, seemed to be in on the other half. But the really good thing about the tsci.i<os was that most of them were gang tackles, indicating that not only were in- dividual men crashing through the varsity line, but the entire freshmen line was beating the varsity line. Several times the varsity quarterback was thrown for huge losses. Champs Are Ready Although it is hard to put. a freshman team together in the short time before the fall season opens, Coach Allison thinks his champs will be ready. He feels that Wesleyan, Vermont, and Ro- chester are the teams to· beat and that this year's team has the po- tential and spirit to do it. Vermont will be the roughest since they are members of the Yankee Con- ference, a tougher division than Union is used to playing in. But says Coach Allison, \I don't think we'll be outclassed completely by anybody this year.\ The team boasts a forty two man squad this year-a fine turn- out. Coach Allison is eA.-pecting a lot from AI Hrdlicka from Saug- erties, New York, and Tom Hitch- cock from Syracuse, New Y ark, at halfback and quarterback re- spectively. Ray List from Har- ington Park, New Jersey looks good at center while guard Tom Morgan from Oceanside, New York, is strongly holding his po- sition. Mike O'Conner from Dal- las, Texas is also shaping up at the end spot. Besides first team strength, depth is needed and with a forty two man squad, they've got it. As a second assistant to Ellery Sedgwick, the publication's editor at that time, Weeks increased his reading speed and comprehension by \narrowing the gaze to the center of the page and reading straight down,\ and by consuming the more difficult works in the morning while he was fresh. In 1938 Weeks was named the ninth editor of The Atlantic, the position that he still retains. SAVE ON PHIL'S OWN BRANDS! fPhil [lUJleh.aJUIJ~ liquor Store 511 UNION ST.
