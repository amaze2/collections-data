In the last eight years Lawrence debating team, coached by Profes- sor Franzke, have participated in 158 non-decision debates and in 45 decisi0n debates. Of the latter group only th.re>e contests have re- sulted in victories for Lawrence op- pc,nents. Two years ago the Law- rence team toured the Pacific coast, engaging in eight contests and won all but one of the debates. The Union team has had a suc- cessful season so far this year, win- ning seven out of 11 debates, losing three and tying one. They gained decisions over Albany Law School, Syracuse, Boston University, Bow- doin, Rutgers, New York State Col- lege for Teachers, and Lehigh Uni- • versity.

.. - f VOL. LIV. Increase Is Proposed For Student Taxes' .Terrace CouncU Asks For Means ()f Finanelat Relief For Ath- letic J}oard Deficit .At a meeting of the Student body yesterday m-orning in the Old cha· .pel .the Terrace ·Council advanced . tho question of the. large def\ci'-t ln thE\ athletic board funds wh1~h will have to b.e met nex.t year an·d discussed the steps .that could be taken to medi.at~ thls condition. Har•ry Risit.zke, :31,. P.I'oposed that the students favor a ·l:ihree dollar per· man increase to be paid f<?l the y.ear w.}ien .the regular _athletlt -board tax i~>· paid. T.he fl10tlon waE voted ta:bled until next Monday t<. give the ·students time to conside1 the step -inasmuch as there ~ere numerous reasons for and agams·t th:e proposal. The Terrace Council brought UJ:. 1the ·subject as the resu~t ?f a c~m ··fere·nce· with -Dean Gans m whtcl. .the annual •budget was discusset and tlie pjafis fo1· n-.ex.t year:s ath letic board, of which the mam fea· .ture is the •B:bolishment of the an· nual deficl.t, were outlined. How· ever, the Dean did not request tht students t0 advance the tax thret dollars but merely sug~ested it al -a means out of tlie difficulty. Om m:eans of eliminating the deficit aE pro.posed ·by the Dean is th~ pa~­ men.t of the coaGhes' salaries dl· . rec.tly by the college, Income Has Not Increased The points that. were .brought out at the Student bo~y mee.ting ana that had been e:xpl·ained .to the Ter' race Council by Dean Garis ·an that ten years ago the student~ paid the same tax. as the present students pay wi~h only s-ev.en sport£ and U:lirty home contests, whilE now th.ere are fourteen spo.r.ts am:. ftf.ty home c.ontests. The Student body has not increased enough tc make up for this development ir. progr-am anQ. consequently the de ficit was unavoidable. Anoth:er point that was advanceC: by James: .Deim All-en, '_31, was that . the source of income for the ath- letic borurd has .been gate receipt> and th!e student tax. The gate re· ilepits have .proved .to be an unre- Uable source of income and have bee:n very Low during. the past se· veral years. Also the policy of the college has been not to encourage gate xec·eipts, as exemplified by the abolishment of the Colnmbia game Therefore the on~ '.!lQ1.trce of inr;:qme is the student tax which is inade- quate to· cover tl1e present-day ex- pen:ditures. It was suggested at the Student body meeting that the only ap- parent means of continuing sport~: at Union in the sa.me manner a>: .fuey have been conducted in the past and to do away with the de- flcit would be to raise the student tax or ftnd some o~ther income. If this is not done the only way for the Board to live within its budget. w<~uld be to cut down on .the pres- . -ent i-ntercollegiate sports program. T.hls question will be decided next Mcmday at the regular meeting. _.,..,_ __ ,0,---- fidmarsh to At tend Glee Clubs Committee Meeting Professol' Elmer A Tidmarsh, Ma:nager Elmer Wise, and Henry Froehlig, leader of the Glee club. will attend a meeting Saturday, at· the Cornell club in New York held by the· ex.ecutive committee o.f tl;le I:rt.f:ercoll!!gi·ata Glee Clubs Council.

You Haven't ·Far to Go-- You Union Men to get the best Frosted& in town Brandhorst Pharmacy \On the Comer\ Union St. and Gillespie Summoning a Ghost to your bidding Valves The chemist Van Helmontein 1609 discov- ered an inyisible substance, an emanation from coal, that he named \geist meaning ghost, shortened in English to gas. Only now do its miraculous possibiliti~ begin to be glimpsed. Only now can mod-. ern industry, like a latter-day Aladdin rub- bing his lamp to summon a vaporous genii, . turn a valve and order this .Ghost to any one of a hundred tasks. From the beginning, the problem was one of piping. When Crane Co., a half century ago, set itself to develop and produce the right materials for every gas and oil purpose, it began an incalculably valuable contribu-. tion to the solution of problems that had held back the gas industry since the Chinese used hollow bamboo. So in the development of the natural and manufactured gas industry, as in practically every other industry, the Crane line of valves, fittings, fabricated piping, and specialties have played an important part. No ·matter what branch of industry you enter, you will find Crane materials playing a similarly important part.

Taking his text from the seventh verse of the sixth chapter of Mat-. thew, \In praying use not vain repetitions as the Gentiles do· for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking;\ Dean Luther A. Weigle of the Divinity school of Yale university, delivet·ed an interesting sermon on prayer at the service _in Memorial chapel Sunday mornmg. \Intimacy with God is the key- note of conscientious praye1·,\ he said. The speaker told of the five simple rules of sincere praying that had been taught to him by his father. Using the word \ACTSS\ as a foundation, each of the letters represent on13 of the characteristics of real prayer: adoration, consecra- tion, thanksgiving, supplication and submissio~. The last, submissi,.on, Dean We1gle finds most lacking in th~ prayers or the younger gener- ation. He claims that without this important feature, the sincerity of the prayer is lost. How to Talk Wlth God \The question in the minds of many persons is how shall they talk to God? How shall we re- ceive an answer? We need not · speak aloud, for we believe he knows our thoughts as fast as they are formed in our minds. The vis- ual images which occur in the pro- cess of thinking are a sufficient medium of prayer,\ said the Dean. \However he said, \it is a good thing to frame many of our pray- ers ip. language, for this helps us to understand what we really be- lieve. Finally everything that comes into our mind is a fitting subject of prayer. By asking the Lord's help in all ou1· problems, large and small, we gain the peace of mind which can come fx·om prayet• alone.
