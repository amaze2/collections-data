The Garnet elev.en has been putting in a week of int~msive practice for the contest under the di-rection of Coach Whitfield. ·rhe practice ses- sions have consisted maiply in scrim- mage periods bel-ween the first and second teams; the sessions being util· i~ed by tl1e coach to attempt to rem- edy a:Q.y defects which have been · noticeilble in the :team-play in the last . two ~ames. The ·collegians have thus far been able to; maintain a record with no defeats chailked up against them and they intend to keep this rec- ord intact until tli.e end of the season. During the weelt, the Garnet eleven · has shown a strong offense which is built around Easterly,, regular center, and Epstein, inside right. Captain 1 Machover, Hacrpell and Wright have j been playing well on the defense and ; it is expected that these men will have I an opportunity t1r display their worth 1 in tomonow's game.

Man~ power Four millions of the best man-power of Europe perished in the Napoleonic conquests. Military con- quest is non-creative, while industry 1s always creative. fi In the last ten years one American manufacturer- the General Electric Company-has created machines having a man-power forty tirt1es as great as that of all the lives lost in the Napoleonic wars. In the years to co:ne, when the college men 8.nd women of today are at the helm of industry andofthe home, it will be realized more and more that human energy is too valuable to be wasted where electricity can do the work better at lower cost.

OLD GOLD offers three distinct improve- ments overold cigarette standards. It's cooler· -. because made from finer and lighter leaf, hand-selected.

Love And .a ~'Is Dancing Bad for the Heart?\ THE CONCO!RDIENSlS, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1926 Soiree Girl - --- - - Lov·e and a pretty Soiree Girl just don't mix. When a man's in lo:ve with a girl and she's a humdinger, .and he asks her t0 a Soiree, he wants, to see mere of her than her shadow, and that's all he sees when she's •the one girl in a miillion to him. Yeh, bef0re l0ng she seems to be the one girl in a mHlion men. Some Bo-Feeps. have lost their sheep. He has to be a prize- fighter to dance ten steps wlth her, and after peering over heads for an hour or two, l~e f·inally sees her cloing a sleepy-time waltz with his best friend, who immediately beeomes his worst enemy, and he wonders, \Is dancing bad for the heart?\ @ r----~ l~:-~~'-'-\'2.:.......:.~~~ .... 1 Fraternity pins play their part too, as he discovers when he finds he's on t11e wrong side or a cu.rtain and ll.ears a conversation something lil\:e this, \WhY how in the world is it you still have your Frat pin? Did you have a quarrel with your best girl? I'm so sorry.\ \Oh no,\ says the husky voice of your roommate, \just never found a girl I liked well enough. Here chuck that one away. How in heck do you unpin the darn thing?\ Then a gentle voice, \Oh please be careful. Don't take it off. I'll give it back tomorrow. I can't change now, he'd be furious, and he's such a bear, he'd spoii the evening:; and I'm having such a glor- ious time now. Aren't you?· Look, I'll pin youi's inside, nearer the heart that beats for you.\ Then silence. \Wh ) \ o .. After a while he wanders ·off and vainly ti\ies to find an empty corne1· in which to drown his grief with a cigarette, if his g.irl has left him any, and· incidentally to forget how deso- late Monday wiU ·be w}!en the bills begin to come in. Finally he comes out of his trance sufficiently to reaUze that his roommate's girl is making frantic signs for him to come and rescue her from the CoUitch Heavy- stepper. And he realizes that here is a girl who will never make a man feel like a counti'Y clodhoppei', or will tell him when he says·, ''I'm very •happy to meet you,\ that, \Lucky's the word, old thing.\ He: 'T m happy to meet you.\ She: \Lucky's the word, old thing.\ That .Monday after that Week-end. As he carries her off for a wa.lk in the moonlight, she murmurs, \I'm so grateful for that rescue. I'll never fol'get it.\ Then he fishes areu~d in his pocket for one of those magnetic pins, a;nd promises hiJnself that the next gjrl he asks to a Soiree will ]:lOt be a humdinger, or a red-hot J;UOmma, but a girl with golden hair and ten<lex· .blue eyes.

It is the means by which success is almost guaranteed. It is part charity and part business, but all common sense. Through its operation, the sb·ong contribute to the support of the weak, and the weak secure, not by favor but by right, duly paid for, the support of the strong. Eve1·y policy is a declaration of independence, a charter of economic freedom. He wbo holds one has overcome adver- sity. The principle upon which this proceeds is all very plain. It has its foundation in th1·ift. Everyone knows that it is not what is earned, but what is saved which measures the difference so slight, from day to day, as to seem unimportant and of no consequence, hut in a few years, it aggTeg·ates a sum of g'reat importance. The ability to save is based entirely upon self-control. This capacity is the m~in element of character. It passes over at once into the realm of good citizenship. .

C., which! according to the dope will he stronger; than ever this year as several of last, year's all·intercollegiate basl~etball; players have joined the Crescent! squad. On the Christmas trip a year I ago the Crescents won from the Gar- I net team but 1ater in the season on the home court the Union team suc- ceeded in giving them a good drub- bing. I The Union team got off to a good start last Saturday by taking the St. Stephens five into camp and if the team continues to improve they should make a clE'an sweep of the New York games. On their return to Schenectady the Garnet men will meet New York Uni· versity on Friday, January 7, and Hamilton on Saturday, January 8. Chemist:ry Students Study Coke-Making Several students in the chemistl'Y course at Union College made a trip to the Hudson Valley Goke Corpora- tion in Troy yesterday to study the : methods used in coke-making. Several trips of this kind are. made : every year to demonstrate the practi- 1 cal applications to '.Vhich chemistry is i being put. The seniors and juniors i malm the trips as part of their course, btlt the members of the two lower i classes who are majoring in chemistry 1 are also invited to go along. on. the trip to the coking plant at. Troy, the students were shown · through the works, and all the details 1 of the methods and principles in- volved were explained in full. The subject of the distilling of coal and the saving o fgas ,light oils, and tar that would have been destroyed if the i coal were burned raw, is of especial; interest to chemists, as coal tar forms ; the basis of numberless compounds. : housands of t}le perfumes, flavorings,! drugs, dyes, and explosives that are i used by civilization come from the l black, sticky substance that was once . regarded as a nuisance, but is now re·: garded as the most important source\ of the numberless organic compounds! that are produced by the chemist. 1 By means of coal tar derivatives, 1 the chemist is producing dyes, per· 1 fumes and .drugs in a higher state of 1 purity than nature itself does. The \ old industry of growing the plant that i supplied the world with indigo was I formerly one of the greatest industries : of India, but the discovery by the Ger· i mans of how to make indigo synthetiC· : ally from coal tar gave the world a . better dye than the one made in na- 1 ture, and put the old Indian industry : on the roclcs. A similar discovery re· i suited in the replacement or the coch· i ineal bug by a coal tar derivative as 1 e lll.ade '.. . . . countless tests to perfect thi'.t better cz~ . rette for.
