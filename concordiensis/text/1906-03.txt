- er - -. y all rill :lly ~0 THE CoNCORDIENSIS VOL ... Y.cYJX. THE EMBRV,O ELECTRICAL EN- GINEER Some Sound Adviee Basecl on Experience One oft 'he most perplexing of all the results for advice or information that are received at this office, is the l·etter asking us to ad vise a young man what course to pursue in order to become an electrical engineer, the means for tak- ing a collegiate course not being available; also to sug~est the best branch of electrical work. It is, of course, imposs,ible for us to offer much specific advice in such cases; without knowing intimately a young man's natural characteristics, one cannot intelligently suggest what avenue of work would be apt to suit him best, and there is no \best branch\ of the electrical industry from any other .sta11dpoint. Naturally, we ad:-vtse taking up a course of study with some coi•r'e~­ spondence school, if one cannot have the ad- vantage of personal tutelage; and· when this is said, it exhausts the possibHiti.es in the way of specific advice und'er tile· circumstances. Generally s.p:eaking, technical education is ab- solutel:Y nece-ss-a;ry to even mediocre success in any b!\at:l~h of electrical or other technical work; with a given amount of honesty, intelligence, and. industry, the better the education, the greater the measure of success. By \education\ we do not mean necessarily college advantages, valuable though they are; some of the highest-grade mei1 in the electrical field are self-educated, and some oft he most hopel~essly incompetent boast college degrees. VVlith the facilities that now exist for acquiring technical education, there is no ex- fi~ed-·no demand for the n1ediocre engineer. If one elects to become an electrical engineer, therefore, the standard should be set very high; and the aspirant must determine to sacrifice everything except personal character, if need be, to the drudgery of acquiring the necessary men- tal training and practical experience. These m.ay possibly be acquired simultaneousJy, but it is usually necessary to obtain the mental tl'ainin.g first. Detailed advice as to just what steps to take in order to secure the requisite knowledge and expe·rience is out of the question; a rnan's resources, environment, and 1·estrictions rhiefiy determine this, and these are seldom combined in the same way· twice. Moreover, a man who posses·ses the personal qualities essential to thor- ouglr success does not require to be. steered along from point to point in his upward course.-Am- erican Electrician. Alumni The annual banquet of the Union College- Alumni Association of the :Xorthwest \vas held at the Union Pacific H·otel, Chicago, Ill., Feb. 26, 1906. Henry C. VV/ood, '83, the president of the· association presided. President Raymond. re- sponded to the toast \The College.'' \He spoke ~,~ of the value of the college of these alumni gath- erings since they served to bring, direct to the alumni information concerning the progress of the college, but especially because of the re'- newal of early associations and quickening of the spirit of loyalty. He t'hen spoke of the annual dinner in New York, which had led drectly or indirectly to much of the recent improvements in. cuse whatever for anyone to remain wholly the college.\ ignorant of funda1n:ental principles and their ap- plication. But the road to com.plete qualifica- tion as an electrical engineer is not an easy one; and while there is always \room at the top,\ there is no room in the class of the poorly quali'- .. \The president dwelt next upon the progress of the last few years, calling attention to the engineering department and the exceptional ad- vantages, which the college is able to offer stu- d-ents of applied sciences because of its location. \.

Dean Ripton also made the statement that many as- sociations, espedaTly in colleges, e·mphasize the social side of the Y. M. C. A. \Vork to the neglect of the spiritual. He criticized the fact that many associations spend too 1nuch effort in trying to make their buildings the center of college life and forget that the work of the as- sociation is broader than this, to spread the Kingdom of Christ among young 1nen. Accident in North College A serious accident and one which might easily have been fatal, befell William F. Coilins of the class of 1909 early Tuesday n'lorning.

This was done Tuesday night to the door of Collins' room. Collins, thinking to steal a march on the practical jokers got hold of a rope-a piece of clothesline---13.nd fastened it to the win- do·w sill in order to lo\ver hilnself to the ground. The rope, however, not being strong enough to bear him, broke as soon as 'he put h-is weight on it.

HANDS UP! Previously this year vve have taken space to speak on that triflir1g matter of Con- cordy subscriptions. After each spasn1 we have waited, but in vain, to see the stream o( filthy lucre pour into the lap of the B]tsi~ ness Manager. The Concordy is a college enterp-rise, destined to be representative of the insti- tution. You n1ay or 1nay not be satisfied that it is fulfilling its 1nission. Tn the tat- ter case why not be n1an enough to sayr so. If vou have not been satisfied with the ol paper why have yon kept on taking it np to the present late date? \i\fhy didn't yon order it stopped? That is the business \vay of doing things. Not having done that, the assun1ption re nains that you are satisfied: at any rate. -it is a settled fact that you have kept on taking it. V\Thy not pay up, then? There is no reason wl1y the Concordy should be run as a charity enterprise. -yet such is the case. The J\1anager is in the hole. and getting deeper in the 1nire every week. He was elected h y a part of the student body to run a student enterprise, not to subsidize it. For the good nan\le of the college we 3-re ashrtme·J to say wha.t a small number have payecl their subscri p- tions. The paper faces a by no n1e a11s vague chance of suspendi11g publication if no more 1noney comes 1!1. Fine sort of an advertisement for our rc~1eg:e that would c: be, wouldn't it? DR-AMATICS The above heading, we fee1 to be v.,..ery deceptive, for from it the casual reader might gather that such things really do flourish here. There is where 11e won~d be deserving of another surmise. \Lack of Dramatics\ would be a far more sui table opening. Rut why is it that Union can never sttpport a dramatic club? Is it because there is no one capable of doing

There must he sonle- thing else. What is :it<? We as:k because so rn:any other colleges take part in so1n'e such 'activity, during the winter and spring m-on:ths.. Nearly all, in £ac:t, do this. Dra1natic: entertain.1nents are g-iven at various ti1nes d1tring t11e year, as. ]or instance, at a ti1ne corresponding to our ffi-nnior \iVeek. vVhen other colleges of our size, and even much st11aller ones, can do this, it sott:nds rather behindhand for us to \N· d 't .,h ~ \XT say, o, we . on . ave any S 1 t1ows. ''v e 1urven't had a dran1a tic clnb for son1e tim.1e.\ A despairing atten1pt in this line was tnade three year,s ago, but died of starva- tion or some kindred ailn1ent. It does not seem too late to do son1ething for Com- tnencement, in connection with ·the :\:fusi- <:al Club's concert. But, if it is too late. }t would most certainlJ be a wise thing £or so1ne men in the three lower classes to take preliminary steps towards organizing a cl·ub which \vonld have sufficient vitality for a can1pa1gn next year.

TOM vVATSON'S MAGAZINE celebrated the con1plet.ion of its first year by making a number of in1:provemen ts .and changes. A year ago the firs.: (March, 19'1:)5) nutnber \Yas issued; it had 128 pages. no illu:strations or cartoons, and was in a way ~ disappointment both to its friends and its editors. But ·with each succeeding nu1nber it grew better. Cartoons and illustrations were added in July. And. no\v the current (Feb., 190•6) number has so 1nany improvements that it is really a ne\v and far super- ior publication. One radical change is the lopping off of the w·orcl \Tom'' frmn the tiUe. From this time on it is the plain W.A TSON'S M:AGAZINE~a shorter, and some think, a n1ore dig.nified title. T'he cover design is new, although sirnilar to the old. Thirty-two page-:; of reading matter have been added, making the present number an 160 page book, not counting the advertising. A Home Department has been added, under the direction of Mrs. Louise Miller, a writer who will be better knO\Yn to \vomen readers ,Jf WATSON'S MlAGAZINE' a year hence. The Cir- culation Manager contributes a page or two of chatty gossip, under the caption, \Along the Firing Line.'~ Mr. Watson himself is doing a prodigious amount of work. His brilliant editorials fill about 32 page'3 in front of the book, while his \Educational Depart- ment\ and \Book Reviews'' contain more genuine educational matter than can be found in any simila'!.~ publication. The fiction in WATSON'S MAGAZINE is equal in merit to that appearing in the 25 cent and 35 cent publications-often better; and the editors are striving hard to be excelled by none. Special articles EXTRA a~ong economic and political Hnes make u.p ~he :J:e- rn.aining pages. There is not ;a frivolous Une ilil the rnagazine used .as a fiUer; but even these ifieaeh valuable lessons. Some of the articles mas ;pr<Yve- too dry for some of the readers but there fs an abundance fnr alil the fa1nily ila its 160 pages. Xern- bers of the Farmers' Union wHl read J. A.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS i£7:0 £.. \'¥ ;Y I X. No 20. • • - - ~ ' . ' ' l FATAL ACCIDENT IN ~BORA TORY kaul Wait, '07, Killed by Electric Charge The college was inexpressabl::y shocked Monday afternoon when it learned of the terrible· <ieath of Paul WJa~t, of the class of 190·\7. The fatality was so sudden and shocking that 'its first effect was nmnbing. The whole sa.d trutir.L \\\Tas hardly real- iz•d. Wait's death cast a prof()un .. d gloom over the \vhoiJ.e college body, both by its very Inystery and because Gf the great f.eling of .roespect that all en- tertained for him. Paul Wait entered Union in tll.e fall of 1903 from Fort Ed·ward, having graduated in the previous spring from the Glens Falls Academy. H.e chose as his course the electrical eng-k1eering and had ac all times been a faithful r.nd con.scientious student. He was a member of the Chi Fsi fraternity. He had always taken ar prom.inent :part in college af- fairs, playing on most of his cla..ss tean1s. He \va::; a n1em l::le'l~ of the Varsity track team and ran on the relay team at Troy recentl~.;r, winning the ad- Iniration of aU by his plucky and almost success- ful effort to turn defeat into victory for his college. With the fellows he was quie-t a..nd reserved, be- cmning liked for the many sterJ:ERg qualities which always 1narked him. On MOnday afternoon Wait ~~~as at work with .a number of l.~1e other members of the Junior mlec- trical Engineers in the electrica:.I laboratory. The class was at work Oh some diveet current machines in the two central roums of th-e .la.bo.ratory when the acci'dent that ha:s lost the c<>llege one of its most p·romising students occu'l're<'l. At the 8l.Xact n1oment of t:he· accident Wait wa~s alone in the switehb<>ard room, th·e rest of tb.e clas·s being io the next room and up stairs in the laborary. A gro-an from t:he switchboard romn attracted W:aters fron1 the ne·xt I~oorn and he rushed in to find his classmate standing rigid in front of the switch 'On the 2300 volt Ughting circuit with both hands on the copper of the switch. He instinsctively pulled Wait from the switch when he fel1 unc01;scious to the floor. A yeH brought the others \Vho were working in the lab. and while some began artificial respiration and did. everything that they could for the injured man, others ran for Dr. Towne. The doctor arrived in less than ten minutes and was clo·sely follo·wed by Dr. Huggins and Dr. Kathan. The three doctors, with the aid of the large number of students who had gathered by that time worked over the man for two hours and a half before all hope for his recovery \Vas given up. At no time during the trea t1nen t was any sign of life· visible, 'ho·wever. Apparently the shock had been great enough to paralize the nerve centers, and the heart action had stopped instantly. It is not known how long the current passed through the body of the unfortunate man, but it w·as proba- bly more than ten se·conds. All the stimulants 'known to medicine, including oxygen, which was secured v·ery soon, were used, the bodily warmth being kept up in the meantime by means of hot water and bla.nliets. Every means known to the medical profe.ssion for combating shock was ap ... plied and the tr€atm.ent was kept up long after aU hope of recovef'Y had been abandoned. The acci- dent occurred at t.wo· .. fifte·en ()'clock and it was. half past four before the man was prO:n,gunme'd~ dead.

,, ·i· ;; 1: \ .I . H i ·,1 THE CONCORDI £NSTS T't1e exact manner in which Wait came in contact -with the pG ... werfu:l sw'itch, and just what reason he had for bei:11g in front of the switchboard a.t that particular time are questions that it is likely will never be answered. T'he- alternating current S\Yitchboa·nl is surrounded by a raiHng about three feet high and Wait had passed insid.e this railiil'g for some uu_kno\vn reason.. The sectio;l'il of students who were a..t work in the· la.®oratory at that time were not ursing the alternating current, but w;ere making so1ne tests on the direct current line, which is on the other side of the room. Wait had \vorked in the laboratory during the last two year$ of his college course and w:as perfectly aware of 'the danger of the high voltage board, so thR.t it evidently was not due to ignorance that he touched the switch.. From the position in which he was found, it is probable· tll:at he walked :past the switchboard and leaned arou11d it to read a meter which is situated behind the board. Then in turning to go back his hand must have swung around and hit the switch or else he must have stumbled and fallen against it, at the same time hitting so.m.e nails in the floo-r with his left foot. H'is sho·es were wet and con- tained ma.ny na.ils, so that a. connection between one pole of the 'Switch and the ground was at 'Once made, a half of the pow:e-rful current passing through his body. Burns on his left hand and foot showed where the current had entere-d and left his b-ody. Wait must have :placed his right hand on his left in an effort to pull the latter from tha switch for be· was found in that position. CORONER CALLED. After two hours and a half of working over the man withou.. t any sign of succe·ss his life was fi.nally despaired .of and the und·ertaker and coroner were sent for. Coroner Dettbarn arrived and went ove:r the· facts of the accident very carefully, after which the body was removed to the und·ertaking rooms of Timeson & Fronk. Coroner Dettbarn asked that 'i test of the circuit b.e made in his presence to deter- mine if any condition out of ordinary existed. Pro- fessor E. E: .. Creighton and Instructor Ferguson of the Electrical Engineering department made a thorough test of the line and found it to be per· fectly no·rm-al. A sp edal test was made to see how much of a eu·~rent (;Otild have passed through the body of a man H ·,perifect contact were made from the nails of the floor to the metal of the switch and a voltage of from 9{)0 to 1500 was detected. After the test the coroner gave it a:s his opinion that no ·one was to blame lli~r the unfortunate accident aTtd that no neglige~ilce w·as apparent. 'Though the nails in the floor a.!lle a dangerous thing a man operating the switch -...vould not be- in a;ny great da..nger as he would iDuch only the insulated handle O·f the switch and woll!1d not come in contact with tbe copper of the switch itself as was done in the case of W:ait. Nevertno€less the floor will be more sa.fe-ly insulated in the 'future. STUDENTS' MEMORIA:L, Directly after the regular chapel e:x:ercises Tues- day 1-nor-ning a special m·eeting of th.e student body was be'l<d at which a committee was a .. ppointed to draw up a resolution expressing the 11ig11 honor and esteem... ifl.. which Paul Wait wa.s held iby hi'S fellovv students and the gri·ef which is felt a...t his loss. A committee was also appointed to take cllarge of th9 sendin_g. of fiowe·rs to the Wait hmne for the fun- eral on Thursday. This meeting was followed by a m.eeiJng of the junior class. T·he class decided to wea..r erepe for a period of thirty days in tribute to the· ::m.emory of their classmate. A. committee was also appointed to draw up resoluti()ns and send them vvUh flowers to Fort Edward. MEMORIAL SERVICE. A very- simple but impressive serv~ice was held in the- ~ollege chapel at 10: 30 o'clock Tuesday morning over the body o-f Paul Wait. No regular college exercises W'ere held during the morning. All the facu:lty and students and a number of the un- fortun.2•te m.an's relatives and close friends were present to pay tribute to his memory. The pulpit was d..raped with a large American flag and the body of our late fellow stud.ent lay directly in front of it. ;The family sat on the left of t:he hapel and the C'hL P'Si fraternity on right, while the Junior class oc:cupied the front seats in the center. Presi- dent Ray-m.on.d officiated at the service, which was begun .by the singing of \Abide With Me.\ After the hY·mn Dr. Raymond delivered a short impres- 'Sive a-ddress in which he said:

Barring accidents, Union faces one o£ the n11ost successful baseball se2tsons in years. But in this connection another point should be e1nph<rnsi.2ed which l1as been al- lowed to lag he1-e at Union. This. is in arranging a suitable schedule £or the Fresh- tnan schednle. While we are upholding our reputa;t,ion be£ore intercoHegiate eyes, we must not forget the schools of the vicinity. The best way to get prep. school men in touch with the college is through athletics. Tl1is ca11not be denied. And 111en are attracted t() colleges n1aking good on the athletic field. Steps should be taken to make out a strong schedulie for a well organized Fresl11nan tean1. Jn this way can we keep the desired hold on the schools and also can train rnen to take varsity positions in later years. Games can easily be proc-ured, for al'r~ady high schools are writing on for dates. More Fresht11en should turn out for prac- tice. If they don't n1ake the Varsity they will then he in good trin1 and in line for the class teatn. 'Ph.e Freshn1an basketball tean1 had a successful schedule.
