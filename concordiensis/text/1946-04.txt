Jp Vous AimP These brave martyrs, so that the spring prom may live out its life in peace and happiness, gave of their dearest possession, their life's blood. Oh God what reward does not such heroism desez·ve? Ever·y afternoon go the daredevils to nearby Ellis hospital to freely hand out for the cause of humanity and womanhood the rich red blood which should be coursing healthily through young, hardy veins. But do they complain:? No. They're too weak and besides they're happy now. They are going to the one and only Spring Prom. Allows, Enfant!

Olsen, president, was. welcomed back with a barrage of new ideas. reforms, and projects. The President reported that the Freshman Frolic, held on March 30, had been a huge success and esti- mated a 185 dollar profit. Sugges- tions were received as to what should be done with this money, but nothing was decided. Members were advised to consult the stu- dents in the respective houses and present their ideas at the next meeting. Nrw Projects .Spencer Gowrie stated that the Freshman Orientati·on Programs were proving very successful.

It will draw crowds anyway and besides we would be having some good clean har·mless fun.\ The courses listed below have been added to the courses offered in the Summer Session.

Onwar•d Christian SoldiPrs That was how it all started, and the gory tale we are now going to tell you will curdle your blood in sheer horror and make your hair stand up on end. Armed only with their square meat hooks and their blood-stained paddles, our little band of Dracula fans went forth to brave the northern wilds swearing to bring back the scalps of the seven freshmen who were endang- ering the courr trysi de for miles around, Loudly and lustily did they sing the rousing Terrace song to build up their courage for this was indeed an adventure fraught with God only knows what danger and bloodshed. Through the un- explored regions of Jackson's Gar- dens trouped the hunchbacked hor- rors gathering forces from the neighboring fraternity houses who were only too glad to be on hand when the slaughter began. Watch the Idol pany, thrOUI{h its campus represen- tative, Jeny Rock. The carnations wer·e presented upon entrance by a member of the dance committee. The shapely misses were also, ex- cept for the slight overhead of transportation, presented absolutely free of charge. In this case, the benefactor was Skidmore College. tWe couldn't think of any pseudonym for the institution which hasn't already been used too many times--editorial policy or no editorial policy. l The occasion for this tempting set-up was the \Freshman Frolic\ in Alumni Gymnasium last Satur- day night. Needless to say, the af- fair was a huge success. Its pur- pose was to welcome the incoming Freshmen and to bring together the entire college for the first big social affair of the term. The dance was financed on a contribu- tion basis and was a success mone- tarily also. The evil scheme of get- ting men interested in area girls before the May prom also appears to have met with success, as many men were more than satisfied with their dates.

Garis, Dean Union ,s Thacher, Physicist, to See Atomic Bomb Test Dr. Everett W. Thatcher, associ- ate professor of physics at Union College, has been named chief deputy to the scientific director of the Army-Navy atomic bomb tests on Bakini Atoll. As assistant to Dr. L. A. Sawyer, technical scientific director of Task Force One concerned with the tech- nical instrumentation program of Operations Crossroads, Dr. Thatch- er will have a ring side seat at the Marshall Islands explosions this summer· which may decide the fu- ture pattern of American foreign and military policy. Dr. Thatcher has been on the faculty at Union College for 15 years and his reputation as one of America's outstanding physicists has been increasing as a result of his postwar research on radio phe- nomena and wartime work on elec- tr·onics and radar. its. regular meeting in the Student Activities Office Tuesday evening and 14 of the 17 active fraternities announced that they had pledged a total of 78 men during the pas week. The large number of pledges indicates that all of Union's fra ternities will operate at norma standards by next fall, The group spent considerable time discussing the all-college prom being held on May 3, and reavowed its intention to give the affair 100 per cent of its support. The fra te:rnity subscriptions> of one dollar and a quarter per man for the Saturday night house dances naust be in to the prom committee by Tuesday, April 16. Fraternities desiring booths for the dance have been requested to let the Council know of their in tentions at the next meeting, to be held in the Student Activities Office at 7:00 P. M., this Tuesday A depledging rule was passed which will prevent any man from pledging another house other than the one he was originally pledged to until the entire Council has been informed of his action, The Interfraternity Council has announced that 14 fraternities pledged a total of 78 men during the recent rushing campaign. Delta Upsilon topped the various houses with the grand total of 14 pledges six of whom were previously pledged to that fraternity. Pledges listed by the various fraternities are: Alpha Delta Phi Keyes Walworth. BPta Theta Pi Randy Stelle, Robert Chi I>si Sprong. James Flynn, Edward Kirchus, Delta Phi Carlton Ar·mstrong, Robert Bull, Eugene Elliot, James Weston Fry, Geo!'ge Mead, Ernest Menillo, Stuart Miller, Joseph Thomas, William Trolenberg, Edward Wil- liamson.

In c-olleges all over the United States students have swooned to his intoxicating guitar and floated o.n clouds of bliss when he toots on hrs John Larson and Don Trainer saw President Davidson and he prom- ised that something will be done \in the near future.\ The seizure of the freshmen was in itself no easy task but our heroes by dint of their miraculous bravery managed to drag the victims off to the altar of sacrifice - the Idol. At the idol the eerie ceremonial rites were prepared and the Poison- ous green paint cans opened to the chant of magic incantations, while several of the ghouls practiced knife throwing at the mere babes in arms who snarled ferociously at the boys as they came near. Final- ly the paint was ready and, herd- ing the human sacrifices to the idol, the Sophs for·ced, actually forced, their victims to paint the idol with their hands. Oh, that the honor of Freshman should so sink into the slime and muck of shame and humiliation. Many a proud head was bowed in shame that woe- ful night as seven wretched slob- bered-up freshmen clambered up and over t]1e idol smearing the en- tire Oriental Devil with their bare hands. Probably the biggest hit Of the evening was the service in the Scuttlebutt. There, perhaps in an effort to prove that they had chosen the fields of endeavor meant for· them when they became teach- ers, various faculty members dished up intricate appetizing con- coctions, specializing in scoops of ice cream.

It is not gener- ally known, but these talented gentlemen are getting an accom- panimist soon, a veteran pianist who goes by the name of Truman. He served for more than a year as technical aide in the Office of Scientific Research and Develop- ment in England, France and Ger- many. He was American represen- tative to the British Radio Counter Measures Board, consultant to the American British Laboratories, and a member of the Combined Intel- ligence Priorities Committee, Elec- tronics Advisory Board, and Com- mittee on Captured Enemy Elec- tronics Equipment.

How to starve a spring fover {with an Arrow Sports Shirt} Comes once again the indolence that foiiows the first robin. What to do? This: Get the slickest Arrow Sports Shirt or Sport Knit you can find at your dealer's. (That won't be hard. Every one gets its share of fine Arrow looks and tailoring. Most of them are washable.) The moment you're in its trim lines, you'll want to dash out for some golf, tennis, or you-name-it. If not, you can always sit around in your Arrow and look like a retired champion. P.S.

THE STUDENT COUNCIL COMES INTO ITS OWN Hats off to the Student Council. We have a a student body which has shaken off the letharg-,\· which shrouded it during· the war years and is now beginning to exert some of the influence which it should on the ca.mpus. One of the foremost accomplishments of the Council has been to institute an ol'ienta- tion program for eHtering students. The need of such a course has been apparent for several years but none ever had the ambi- tion to adopt a program. When the need of some changes in the Hale House dining room was felt, the Council acted. The changes it proposed were put into operation immediately and everyone was pleased with the result. Social life has received a boost from the Council. It sponsored an informal dance last term and also .sponsored this term's first so- cial activity, a dance, in Alumni Gym last Saturday evening, It is also wo1·king in con- junction with the Interfraternity Council on the \Paris in the Spring\ dance. All of these things make us feel that the Student Council is gaining the position it deserves on campus. The manner in which it has handled affairs makes it evident that p1·esent-day students are completely capable of running student government. They can, and are, exerting the spirit of self-determin- ation which should not be denied any man. onsl would have bee~ over-joyed at the chastity of their little charges. At the terpsichorean struggle lat- ter that night, the usual feats of strength were consummated as the gasping, sweating couples pushed their way over the sticlty floor to the uncertain rhythms of the slightly more than mediocre or- chestra. Wilting posies of dis- couraged appearance and inter- mediate hues fell haphazardly to the floor adding more impedimenta to the already impeded throng. At length, the tedious eons faded into nothingness and the rabble dis- persed to return to thet·e respective hovels unkempt and more than slightly damp. The Faculty wended their weary way back to their pro- fessorial beds and mates swearing never again to become part of the tom-foolery of the student body, The bored drivers of the tired look- ing buses picked up their bored passengers and the bored Union- ites stiffled yawn$ as they prom- Ised to \Call you up sometime.

The latter system is relatively unknown in college ranks and Mel is sure that there is plenty of room for this type of attack in college football since it has already shown its ef- fectiveness in the National Pro- fessional Football League. Many Missing A large number of prospective players will be absent from these Spring drills because of their par- ticipation in various other sports .. Potential varsity men on the base- hall team includes Hal Enstice and Bob Bal'tlett, two first-string back- field men in 1942, Carl Falivene, a husky fullback from Notre Dame, plus Bill Bartlett and Bill Eade, a pair of guards who have had some high school experience. At the same time the track team shows up with Leroy Siegel, part of the '42 backfield with Bartlett and Enstice, besides \Jigger\ Hanson and \Tiny\ Pat Sullivan a couple of giant linemen who should prove valuable with a little experience. Lacross claims its share of foot- bailers including John Kennedy and Torn Reppuenhagen both of whom could help bolster the line. Equipment for Spring practice is being issued by Fred Parks, first, has been d0ing some ex- perimenting, and has been using Bush at the initial sack, with Lar- son taking over the latter's outfield btrth along side of Enstice and Galvin. Bush handles himself well, and is hitting with the best. If he does not make the grade at first, or Falvene or Carabineris take O\'ei', he shall have to fight to win back the outfield position from Lar- svn, who is also doing fine work. When Enstice takes the hill, his centerfield slot will probably be filled by Les Jobaggy, who has a slight edge over Deug Barry. The catching situation is still up in the air from everybody's view- point except perhaps that of Law- rence, but it is certain that no one will know what his decision will be until a later date. Harry Philo i;; a l<:>ft handed hitter, and with seven other right handers in what could be called a tentative lineup, this factor should be an import- ant one. Tucker Redden, at third, con- tinues to be the sharpest man on the squad, and Bob Bartlett, if he does pitch. would be missed at short.

Abie sighed for what was not, And dreamed, while resting from his labors, He dreamed of the Gardens and the wench Joe got And spat at the Date Bureau, his friends and neighbot's. Abie would have loved a Skidmore beauty Albeit he had nevet· seen one; He would have sinned incessantly Could she have been one.

It is used in reference to a great sea wave which is the result of a displacement on the floor of the sea. Such a displacement, which may be miles in extent, causes vibrations in settling down, known on land as earthquakes, and al~o causes the tsunami waves when the settling portion of the ea-rth's crust is under water.\ Pointing out that a minor sea wave hit the New England coast within recent years, causing prop- E'l'lV damage, the educator listed other famous tsunami disasters. In 1755 in Lisbon, Portugal, he said, a wave 60 feet high, coming from an unlol'ated spot in the Atlantic ocean, caused the loss of several thousand lives; while in 1877, an 80-foot wave started off the coast of Chile and caused great loss of life and damage to the coastline of that countt'\'.

Y., FRIDAY, APRIL 12, 1946 N'EWS SCOOP OF THE WEEK Price 1 Oc: ANNOUNCE HOUSING PLANS FOR PROM Skidmore's Girls Featured In Idol Painting Ceremony It took the girls of Skidmore'!>-·--------------- College to break one of the oldest traditions which has been main- •· tained at Union College, a seat of tradition and heritage since its foundation in 1795. Five Skidmore students recently invaded this men's college and the l'esult of their handiwork left the befuddled males gaping. With paint and brush in hand, the quintet of Saratogians set forth to accomplish what has never before been done by feminine hands. Union's oft pa,inted \Idol a large stone carv- ing occupying a prominent position on the campus, was the target of their attack. As a result of their hurried ac· tivity the Idol soon bore a new coat of paint, gleaming white this time. Although the figure has been painted some five thousand times during its many years on the campus, it had never been so treated by alien hands. Startled Union students watching the scene were so amazed that no one made any effort to stop this violation of their sacred privilege. The work bore a definite fem- inine touch which was indeed an innovation on the campus. Beady red eyes glared forth at passers- by, brightly colored fingernails and highly rouged lips added another effect which the carving has not displayed in the 90 years it has been the center of attraction at Union. After completion of this diaboli- cal scheme, one of the group, paint- bespattered Mary Gregory Gand- sey, Virginia, Minnesota, stated, \Time and again Union men have related to us tales of their ancient custom of painting the Idol. It sounded like loads of fun and we decided that tradition or no tradi- tion, we were going to join in on it.'' Others who participated in the bizarre violation of tradition were the Misses Joyce Young, Rochester; Margaret Ann Doucette, Scarsdale; Virginia Given, South Orange, New Jersey; and Barbara Quirin, New Rochelle, New York. The Idol's history at Union dates hack to the middle of the last cen- tury. The large stone carving ar- rived on the campus in 1856 after a tedious journey from China. It bore a vague resemblance to a lioness clutching her cub between her front pa-ws. Union's Idol was not much different from a number of similar stone figures which exist in profusion in the Orient, but to the students it was indeed a rarity. The Idol had not matriculated long at Union when it was erected in a prominent spot on the cam- pus. Its early life was peaceful and serene. until some undergrad- uate pranksters conceived the idea of painting the figure. Coat after coat of paint was splashed over the carving as the rival classes battled to display their dominance on the campus by making the figure bear their colors. Upperclassmen attempted to keep the color green, signifying the cus- tomary greeness of the college freshman. The yearlings disliked this deriding and would add varied tints every time they discovered the Idol in this hue. The figure has been painted as often as six times a day during its lifetime and the sophomore have often discip- lined freshmen by making them apply the detested green coloring with their hands. Down thmugh the years the rivalry has flared, but it has al- ways been strictly a Union custom and few alien hands have dared to violate it. On one occasion a group of students from Troy, home of Union's arch rival RPI, attempted to move the Idol from its traditional seat. However, the weight of the mass proved to be greater than even \hose neophyte engineers could calculate and although they unseated the figure, it was not removed from the campus. Now shocked out of their tran- quil day to day routine, Un~on stu- dents are beginning to real!ze that it no longer is a \man's world.\ Fall Plans As Suggested Discussed By Fraternity By.

The Inter- national Re1ations Club has long realized the need fot· more informa- tion on this important subject and has obtained an excellent 55 minute film entitled On!> Da;r in Sovit•t Russia. The film will be shown at the Old Chapel at 7:30, Friday night, April 12th. One Day in Sovil\t Russia was written and is narrated by Quentin Reynolds. It is the most complete factual film report of life in the Republics of the U.S.S.R .. a V'l.'St, colorful panorama of the cultures, peoples, economy, industries, geog- raphy, customs, education, and wei- fare programs of this vast land .. It is a definitive educational back· ground film of !!igh interest throughout. Ninety-seven first rate ·cameramen worked <imultaneously across the length hnd breadth of the land to prepare this avera II presentation. It is not a war film. Here is an excellent opportunity to become acquainted, through the medium of this film, with Soviet .

A drawing will be made early that afternoon and the holder of the winning ducat will t·eceive a handsome expansi-on bracelet. The bracelet is on dis- play in the Bool,store and after looking at it, students might as well save themselves a trip and buy their tickets at the same time. Only those who have tickets on or before next Wednesday will be con- sidered in the contest. First Come, First Served! Dick Palla has handled housing anangements for dates. They- will be housed in the Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Phi and Psi Upsilon houses. Reservations may be secured from Mrs. Briggs in Hale House at any time. The charge for the· two nights will be one dollar and a quarter, which will be used to cover the ex- penses of bed !men and moving bunks into other houses to offer sleeping accommodations to men di.splaced by the influx of holidates. Men living in the houses- being used for the girls will have first choice on those sleeping accom- modations. Others may sign up at an:,· time after midnight tonight. The committee will guarantee a room for any person Signed up be- fore April 26. Reservations may still -be made after that date, but sleeping quarters will be provided only if there is sufficient space in those three houses. Nine Days Left Only nine days of school remain between now and the time that ticket prices will rise. Be wise, avoid the rush and avoid inflation. The ducats are now available at six dollars, plus tax. They may be obtained from committee members or from the following ticket agents; Don Baker, Alpha Delta Phi; Joe Harmon, Delta Upsilon; Jerry Rock, Psi Upsilon; Harry Hawkes, Sigma Phi; Bob Carroll, Phi Delta Theta; Herb Adams, Phi Gamma Delta; Spencer Gowrie, Old Gym; Doug Barry, Beta Theta Pi; Ed Williamson, Delta Chi; and Dave Grant, Cht Psi. Navy students may obtain the stubs from Dick Palla, South College, or Jack Tway, North College. Off-campus men will find tickets in abundance in the College Bookstore. Time Flies Bob Scott has requested all fra- ternities to pay their assessments for the Saturday night dances by Tuesday. A majo!'ity of the houses have already met their obligations and four bands have been signed to play at the affairs. Navy students are requested to give money for their subscriptions to Dick Palla or Jack Tway and Neutrals to Jerry Rock. House decorations will be han- dled by fout· fraternity, one Navy and one neutx·aJ group. Assign- ments to houses will be made with- in the next two weeks. and each group will be responsible for deco- rating its house before the Satur- day night dances. Booths at the Da.nce Money for booths at the \Paris in the Spring\ dance must be paid to Stu Miller by next Tuesday. Drawing for booth positions will be made shortly after the Ea.ster recess. AI I houses will ·be notified in advance as to where and when the drawings will be held. Dr_ C. Victor Brown, chaplain of Union College, will deliver the ser- mon at the Sunday morning chapel service April 14 in Memorial chapel on the campus. The service begins at 11:00 A. M., and is broadcast by radio station WGY from 11:15 to noon. Alumni Gym-May 3

The representatives in the Student Council have endeavored to bring the com- posite student attitude before thP Adminis- tration. In answer, the college, through Uw voices of tbe President ami the Chaplain, has expressed the feeling that complete abol- ishment of the Sunda:-· Chapel progmm can lead on]~- to harm fo1· the college. At a meeting held last .Jlonday night. the Chaplain of the college pt·esented what he and the President hope will prove to lw a solution of the p1·o1Jlem. They proposed that a committee of the best minds of' the Stu- dent Body be formed to study the policies of the college in regard to the religious question. To operate over an arbitnu~· length of time, the committee will delve deeply into the feelings of the students, the Ar!ministi'H- tion, the Facult~·, and the Trustees of the College in the hope that some satisfactor~· answer ma~: be found. An alternative pro- position was made to the effect that thl'l'l' would IJe a compuls01 y BiLle rlass instituted for all four classes of students. Although the students seem to feel rather strongly that thue should be no restriction~' whatever in the matter. there have been onP or two ideas proposed which merit mention. Chief among these is the presentation of at least six musical chapel pmg1ams \\'hich, rm· from being a duty to endure, should be nf interest to the stuctents as a whole. Trying to look at the controversy from a strictly neutral point of view, we can hardly feel that the goove1·ning body of Union is pla~·ing entire!~· fai.r ·with the students. 2\l<my of u::; have retumed but recent!~· from a fat·- greater strife than any we may cause here. One of the maiN. issues at stake dul'i<ng the past war was the f1·eedom of all to \rorship when, where, and how, to say nothing of IF they please. The present system, while liberal in many aspects, hardly gmnts the students this right. It is true that the Administration does not require all to attend the services IJclr! in }.Iemorial Chapel so long as the~· can show evidence that they have attended serv- ices at a place of worship of their own cnoos- ing satisfactory to the College. This is, at first glance, a \'ery liberal attitude, BllT the Students of L:nion College are n0t chil- dren, although actions often may prove otherwise. It is insulting to the maturity of the individual that he is perpetuall~· checked upon. \Ye, as one of the voices of the Student Bor!y, do herewith petition the Administra- tion to take immecliate steps-not a long- time period of investigation-to l'emedy the situation which can not be \Vholly conect if the student body, a::; a sentient mas::;, pro- tests so unanimous!~·.

They marched dramatically down to the Rtation behind a ban- net· proclaiming, \Good-bye Sche- nectady -- Back to· Civilization.\ Passing \Tony's\ they glanced at \Shepherd\ Anderson, hoping he would look the other direction long enough fat· them to say good- bye over a few lemonades. cHe didn't.) Andy's tlock is a happy and care- free 0ne. They will be missed here: the \Duke\ with his color and more colorful language, \Bugs\ with his pin·k cheek8 and roving eye and humor, Emil Massa with l:li8 cryp- tic remarks about the Navy, and even AI Pratt and his \sea stories\ about Vermont. They will aU be missed for they at•e al'l taking some- thing away ft•om UnioB that we have lived with. The most touching sight was the farewell given to those lucky few whose female ac- quaintances wet•e on hand. And how. Retut·ning to more immediate af- fairs, our corning Prom is once r,1ore brought to mind. This time Skidmore, in its not too subtle manner, did it. In case you haven't walked by the Idol this week, some girls from Saratoga left us an artistically painted hint that there nrc plenty of girls there who would like nothing better than to come to the Prom. If anyone is still moaning about not trusting the student date bureau, you now have your chance to choose for your- self. Just transport yourself to the Skidmore campus this week-end and Jool{ over the field. When you find what you want all you need to do is to smile at it. You need not worry about formal introduc- tions as they are out of date at Skidmore. As a matter of fact, it is wise to go in a gt·oup of three or four. Anyway you had better be sure to Jog out so the Navy will know where to send its searching party. You can never tell what may happen to you when you step on that campus. Leaves are always the most pleasant part of life in the Navy. There are a variety pf plans that are now being discussed for the coming Easter leave. Some of the more ambitious ones plan to fly South. courtesy of the ATC, for a few days of basking in the Florida sun.

QUIET For lo, these many mornings we have been awakened in the dark hours of the eal'ly dawn IJy the strident voice of the alleg-ed ;\!avy siren secreted some\\·here on the cam- pus. Investigations have revealed that we are not alone in being disturbed by the nois~· thing. :.\Iany of our fellow-students have lil<ewise complained of the rude awak- ening. Ful'ther investigation has revealed that the Navy, for whose use the si1·en \\'HS ori- ginally (supposed]~-) installer!, derives no benefit from its regular sounding at the ~aval Reveille time. The detachment here at PLEASE! L'nion, being stationed fm· from the somce of anguish slumbers on peacefully unaware until theil' own more efficient methods arouse them to duty. Gmnted that at one time there might have been a need for the siren, but that time is no longe1·. Since representative members of the :--Java! detachment have declared that they never hear the siren and since the mem- bers of many of the campus houses have as- serted thHt they have been disturbed by it, can there not be some action takeN. to silence for once and for all this scourge to much needer! sleep'? A LITTLE HELP, PLEASE! In the se1·vice, there was an interesting· and edifying little practice which mig-ht easily ancl usefully be adopted here at l'nion. We are speaking of Police Call. Every moming, it was customary for the soldier- boy, the swabbie, the go~-rene, to fall out in front of his barracks in column, march brisk- ly to the company area and \Pick up every- thing that doesn't gro\\'.\ Since the snow has disappeared from the Dorp, the casual oLservet· can hardly but be appalled by the debris collecting on the once- immaculate lawns and terraces, the dilapi- dated shrubbery, the ugly scars on the greensward. There is some reason to think tha.t most of the neglected look of the cam- pus can be attributed to the students The Campus grounds crew is unaule to cope with the situation. The Students, either through natural indolence or just plain lacka- daisical attitudes, have done little to alle- viate the condition. In the past, the college initiated the sys- tem of having the gym classes form raking brigades in the Spring and Fall seasons when the overworked grounds crew was unable to complete the landscaping by themselves. There have been spasmodic resurrections of the system but to little avail. The Concordiensis stl'ongly advocates that, first, the Administration once more employ the medium of the Gym classes to aid in policing the campus; second, that the Stu- dent Council institute a move to encourage the individual student to aid in the overall picture by installing additional trash cans m strategic places about the grounds. In this way, we feel that the campus may once again resume the appeamnce which once made it the em~· of Rll small colleg-es in the country.

Na- twn-wide reports have rated it as excellent and Union also will rate Bobby Sherwood and his orchestra among the best after it has heard htm give out with his scintillating rhythms. Madt-moiselles Prome-nade Dec01·a tions have been styled along Parisian lines and should produce a nostalgic feeling in vets who saw Europe and its gayest city. The committee expended ef- fort to complete the atmosphere with some comely mademoiselles and a few old men selling tooth- brushes, but these will have to be furnished by the individuals attend- ing the affair. Street artists will be in evidence and for a nominal fee you may have yourself and your date sketched in this makeshift Parinsian environment. Athleti\' Events Featured Baseball and lacrosse games have been scheduled for Saturday after- noon and will be free for all. The games should be over early enough so that those eager beavers will have time to picnic for awhile be- fore the house dances begin. The house dances are scheduled to last f1•om nine to 12 Satut·day evening and after that your time is your own. Housing of dates is being handled through Mrs. Briggs in Hale House. The committee has guaranteed rooms for all girls who are reg- istered by today. If the demand is great enough another house will be made available in addition to the three already assigned to the task. Registrations after today will be accepted only if there is sufficient room for the dates, and that is htghly doubtful.
