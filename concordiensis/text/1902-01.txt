The Board of Editors of the Concordiensis for '99, realizing the small amount of literary material in the publication, presented to the faculty a petition asking that sotne arrangen1ent might be t11ad,e· whereby literary work for the paper might be substituted fo1· the regular work in essays and orations. The petition was pre- sented to the faculty and granted, but for one year only. · The present board, feeling that perhaps there might be some students who would like to avail themselves of this opportu- nity, have consulted with the head of the Rhet- oric department, Dr. Hale, and through him the plan becomes again active. The arrange- ment will be good for the remainder of the college year. The petition provides that: \During the remainder of the college year literary contJ·iblltions submitted by the students for the Concordiensis, and duly accepted there- for, shall be accepted by the faculty as a substi- tute, in kind, for regular work in the depart- ment of rhetoric.\ To carry out the above plan the following rules shall be in force : I. All literary work, in order to be accepted must be satisfactory to the head of the depart- ment of rhetoric (or to anyone whom he n1ay name) and to the editorial board of the paper ; ·and, if duly accepted, such work is to be an exact equivalent, so far as college requirements are concerned, to a regular essay or orati<;>n. II. Every student desiring to take advan- tage of such offer shall register with th'.~ head of the department of rhetoric, and shall han'd in his contributions to the editor of the Concordiensiii at least two weeks before the date upon which is due the regular essay or oration of w htch it is to take the place. In case the manuscript is rejected, the contributor shall be given notice at ~ the earliest possible date after it is submitted and not less than eight days befot·e the said essay or oration is due. III. No individual student shall be allowed to substitute new spa per work for tnore than one exercise during any coBege tenn. IV. This substitute work may be taken by any students in any of the four regular classes except the first term sophomore and the third freshmen. THE SCARLET AND GARNET. The recent publication '' The Scarlet and Garnet\ deserves the careful attention of every one interested in Union aad Rutgers Colleges. This book, compiled by A. H. Hinman, Union 'oz, ~nd C. R. Blunt, Rutgers 'o4, contains poen1s from the various publications of the two colleges, as the Rutgers '' Targun1\ and ''Scar- let Letter,\ and the \Concordiensis \ Par- thenon\ and \ Garnet\ of Union. The book is a typical under-graduate publication. It con- tains college men's ideas, expressed in poetry, and this in itself is enough to give intrinsic value to the book. The first part of the book is given over to the songs of the two colleges, this is fitting, besides, delighting the old graduate to see again the songs of his alma tnater collected in print. Then there are some unique and de- lightful little verses on love and nature, written in the happy vein so characteristic of the under- graduate. The verses on college escapades are not to be passed by unnoticed. It takes a college man to appreciate them-some of them, but anyone can enjoy them. The verses on wit and hutnor are very clever. Now while n1ost college publications are good, some are of inter- est to college students only. Not so with the '' Scar let and Garnet.\ While of course it is

6 THE CONCORDlENSIS. more largely appreciated by college men, there is no one who will not only be interested in, but will greatly enjoy reading it. The volume is arranged very tastefully, and neatly bound in ,: grey cloth with red lettering. It seems quite fitting that Union and Rutgers should be brought together in this work. Such evidence of litet·ary enterprise is pleasing to all who are , interested in the two colleges and is sure to re- ceive their most hearty support. Many of the alumni have already expressed their interest in the \ Scarlet and Garnet\ and have spoken i very favorably of it. Atnong the selections from Union publica- tions, several merit especial mention. ;, Rah! Rah l Rah!\ by J. A. O'Neil, '97; \The Old Blue Gate,\ by Dr. James R. Truax, '76; \Hymn to Union,\ by S. B. Howe, '62 and S. B. Howe, Jr., '03. are selections which not only picture to the alumnus his under--graduate days, but which intensify his regard for Old Union. Another selection entitled (dIn Whitie's Chair,\ will interest all who ever studied with Dr. Whitehorne. There are still a number of copies on hand and any of the alumni and friends desiring them may obtain the same fron1 A. H. Hinman, 'o2. T'he price ofthe book is one dollar. UNION-QUTGERS. DEBATE. Final Arrangements Made. NEW YO'RK ALUMNI DI~NE:Q. Held at the Hotel Savoy December 12. The annual dinner of the Union College Alumni Association of New York city was held at the Hotel Savoy, Thursday, Decen1ber rz. President A. V. V. Raymond, in his toast, \Alma Mater\ made an appeal to philanthro• pists. and wealthy m.en in behalf of the smaller colleges. \While millions of dollars in gifts roU into the treasuries of a few large colleges,\ said Dr. Raymond, \the stnaller institutions are neglected. 'Two-thirds of the higher educa- tional work of this country is done by these so- called smaller colleges, but they are practically ignored when millions are to be giYen away. It is well that the large colleges should have these millions. The need for improved laboratories, erilarged· libraries and better facilities requires large expenditures, but I would say this to men who have millions to bestow : Union presents an opportunity for investment that in ten years will yeild a larger return than can be obtained in one hundred years by founding a new institu- tion.\ Frederick W. Seward, '49, president of the Alum1j association, was toastmaster. The list of speakers and toasts follows : Pres- ident A. V. V. Raytnond, '75, ''Alma Mater;\ Chief Justice Charles C. Nott, '48, of the United States Court of Claims, \Old Union:\ Professor William Wells, \The Songs of Union ;\ ·Rev. Dr. Sheldon Jackson, '55, com~ missioner of education to Alaska, \Alaska ;\ Any one wishing to try for places on the Congressman Joseph Randall, '8z, Louisiana, intercollegiate debating team for the debate \Liberty Under Law;\ William H.

'The Student Volunteer movement for Foreign Missions, which calls this convention, is one of The Fourth International Convention of the · the most remarkable enterprises of students the Student Volunteer· Movernent will meet in Toronto, Canada, February 26 to March 2. The previous conventions were held at Cleve- land in 1891, in Detroit in 1894 and in Cleve- land in I 898, and were the largest meetings of students ever held. The last one was attended by over 2200 delegates. Students will be sent as delegates fl·om the institutions of higher learning from all sections of the United States and Canada and it is probable that 500 institu- tions wi 11 be represented. 'l'hose in attendance will also include professors, national leaders of . · young people's organizations, returned n1ission- aries, representatives of Foreign Mission Boards and editors of religious papers. The program will consist of addresses during the morning and evening sessions, and section meetings for the consideration of missions. from the Rtandpoint of phases of work, the different missionary lands and of the denorninotions represented. The addresses which will be given will deal with the obligation of promoting the missionary enterprise, the n1eans which are essential to its success and its relation to the students of this continent. Among the speakers are Mr. Robert E. Speer; Mr. John R. M~ott, who will return frorn his tour around the world to preside at this convention ; Right Rev. M. L Baldwin, Bishop of Huron; Mr. L. D. Wishard, the first college Young Men's Chris- tian Association secretary ; Bishop Calloway; President Capen of the American Board of For- eign Missions; Dr. and Mrs. F. Howard Taylor of China, and tnany returned missionaries and secretaries of Foreign Mission Boards. Student Christian Leaders of other lands will also par- ticipate. As the citizens of Toronto will entertain the delegates to the number of 25oo, the only neces- sary cost of attendance will be the traveling ex- penses. Reduced rates have been granted by the railways. It is not expected that the major- ity of those attending will be prospective mis- world has seen. It was started in r886 when at the first N orthfi.eld student conference 100 students expressed their desire and purpose to becon1e foreign missionaries. The call to li;l·is- sions was taken the following year by two PriBceton students to the colleges of the country. Two years later the movement was definitely organized. As a result of its work several thousand capable college men and wom.en :ha\re been led to form the purpose to spend their lives on the mission field, 18oo have already been sent out by the regular missionary boards, while similar moven1ents have been inaugurated in Great Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Scan- dinavia, South Africa, Australia and other countries.

LITEQAQY STUDY OF THE BIBLE. Those interested in literary study will be pleased to know that the efforts of Dr. Truax to organize a class for the study of the Bible have been highly successful. On Sunday, January 5, about twenty-five college rnen assembled in Silliman hall parlors for the purpose of organization. The class first proceeded to the election of officers which resulted as follows: T. DeL. Coffin, 'oz, president; George W. Donnan, 'o3, treasurer; Charles G. Stiles, 'o4, secretary. Dr. Truax then briefly stated his gratification at the response to his invitation and outlined the work. The method of instruction will be by lecture on a text of the ''Modern Readers' Bible\ of the Moulton Series. It is Dr. Truax's intention to conduct the class himself, and to endeavor to set forth the beauties of the Bible as a piece of literature. The class meets at noon each Sun.day in Silli- man hall, uniting with Dr. Darling's dass in a short prepatory song service. At the next meet- . ing the lecture wiH be upon the literary charac- ter of various portions of the Bible. There- after a regular study of the Psabns will be begun. ALL AMERICA ELEVE·N. The New York Post makes the following selections for the All American foot ball team for the season of 1901 : Campbe11, Harvard, left end ; Bunker, West Point, left tackle ; Olcott, Yale, left guard; Holt, Yale, ~centre ; Warner, Cornell, right guard; Cutts,. Ha1·vard, right tackle ; Bowditch, Harvard, right end ; D·aly, West Point,. quarter back and captain; Kernan, . Harvard, left half back ; Weeks, Colu1nbia, right half back ; Graydon, Harvard, full back. The team picked by the New Yorlc Tribune consists in the same backs, tackles, centre and right guard, but places Davis ~nd Henry of Princeton at the ends and Barnard of Harvard at left guard. BASKETBALL GAME. In a fast game of basketball played at Glens Fall8 on the evening of December 25 the Satter- lee Hose Company's crack team was defeated by a team composed of Smith and Coon of Glens Falls and Thebo; '02, Cronkhite, 'o4 and Burnha1n, 'o5, of the college. The game re- sulted in a defeat for the Satterlee tearn by a score of 26-6. Tl1e halves were twenty-five minutes each. Score at end of first half, 15-o. The result is surprising when the fact is taken into consideration that the victorious team had had practically no practice together.

' successful as a lawyer turns to literatu:ve. Mr. S. S. Reed, 1902, has passed successfully through an operation at the Albany Hospital, and his friends hope to see hin1 at the school · once more soon after the holidays. On Dec. 9, that popular and successful Law School Club, The Devil's Own, gave its monthly dinner at the Hotel Ten Eyck. Covers were laid for fourteen personb in the private dining room adjoining the ball room. The table decorations were in admirable taste and an elaborate menu was furnished. The guests of the evening were Messrs. Fletcher W. Batter- shall and Lewis R. Parker of the Law School Faculty, and Messrs. G. H. Holcombe and R. W. Kathan of the senior class. This is the first time in the history of the school that the faculty have taken part in one of the school's fraternity functions, and it prophesies a closer social bond between faculty and student in the future. Owing to pressure of professional engage- ments Mr. J. Newton Fiero, Dean of the Faculty, who had accepted an invitation to be present, was compelled to postpone his visit, and absence from the city prevented Judge Tennant from joining the party. During the course of the evening a number of toasts were given, Mr. Melvin T. Bender, President of the Club, acting as toasttnaster. The speeches of the members of the Faculty were of especial interest. Mt. P~tker afte1~ hutnorously dwelling upon the perplexities oc- casioned in his mind by the name of the Club, complimented its officers and members upon the excellence of its aims and congratulated them upon its deserved success. Speaking of the school work, Mr. Parker referred to its brilliant record in the State Bar examinations, That Mr. Battershall's dictum is not uni- 1 versally true is proved by his own successes in both fields. The toast list is as follows : The Student from the Pro- fessor's Standpoint ...... Mr. L. R. Parker. Examination Papers ....... Mr. T. A. Rothery. The L.a wyer on Literature. Mr. F. W. Battershall. The Bachelor and Other-~ .. Mr. G. Pike. Navy Experi~nces ......... Mr. G. Holcombe. The Junior Class .......... Mr. G. Parr. The Gentlemen of Leisure .. Mr. Fuller.

Dr. Truax will use in the work books from the Modern Reader's Bible series edited with an introductory and notes by Dr. Richard G. Moulton, professor of literature in English in the University of Chicago. The work will consist mainly of lectures delivered by Dr. Truax, who will always conduct the class. THE plan as outlined in this number for the sub- stitution of literary work for the Concordiensis in place of essays and orations should certainly be taken advantage of. The arrangement as in vogue. in 1899 and 1900 proved to be successful but for some unaccountable reason it was not taken up by last year's boa:vd of editors. The Union College w,eekly is too much of a newspaper. While the news should not be omitted yet as the sole repre- sentative of the college to the alun1ni and friends of the institution its ·volumns should contain, at least occasionally, some literary effort. And with the idea of fostering any literary endeavor in mind the present board has succeeded in the re- establishmdnt of the plan as inaugurated by the class of '99. AT about this -season of the college year it is customary to say something relative to the forth- coming Garnet. The class of 1903 have gone at their task most heroically and have protrtised that the book would be out by the end of the winter term. It is to be hoped that they will be able to keep their promise. The volume this year, which will be the forty-seventh, is, it is understood, to have some marked improvements. The old, old fact needs to be emphasized again that the suc- cess of the book does not depend entirely upon the board of editors but upon the students. It rests with them to make it a good book, a fitting annual to represent Old Union. They are to be the con- tributors. And here it may be stated that the con- tributions should consist of literary articles, grinds, \dates drawings, photographs, both of athletes and college views, and snap-shots of any- thing about college. These should be numerous and should be handed in as soon as possible. AMBITION. '~What is the highest goal of your ambition?\ I hear you ask. I an$wer, sin1ply this, \To live in such a way that, when I die, The world, forgetting me, can ne'er forget The life I led, the good I tried to do, But may they write- as epitaph these words Above the simple grave they lay me in- ' Here lies the dust of one who, as he died, So did he ever live, a Christian brave;- A faithful friend, a patriot true, An honest man.

Madill, president of · the Union Trust Company, died at his home in St. Louis on December I rth of heart disease. George A. Madill was born at \Vv ... ysox, Brad- ford county, Pa., June 9, 1838. He received his higher education at Union College, Schenec- tady, N.Y., and graduated from the law school at Albany. He began the practice of law in 186o at Owego, N. Y., where he remained till 1865, when he went to St. Louis. During the last year that he lived at O·wego he tnarried Miss Julia Peck, who removed with him to St. Louis. She died about ten years ago. Sub- sequ~ntly he married Miss Lizzie McMillan of St. Louis, who with a da ughtet, Georgette, aged 5 years, survives him. Charles Madill, a son by the first ·wife, was also at his bedside when he passed away, he having been sum- moned from Texarkana, Ark., where he is superintendent of the electric light and street railroad lines, which are owned chiefly by Judge Madill and John Scullin. A brother, Dr. Thomas Madill, still lives at the old home- stead in Pennsylvania. On locating in St. Louis Mr. Madill entered actively iGto the practice of law and soon gained distinction at the bar. In 1870 he was elected to the position. of circuit judge, which position he filled with credit for one tertn. He was urged by other members of the bar to accept another term, but he declined, preferring to devote his time to the practice of law, in which he was eminently successful. He formed a partnership with Thomas E. Ralston,Union, '64, with whotn he practiced till 1884, when he be- came associated with the firm of Hitchcock, Madill & Finkelnburg. About r 892 he was tnentioned as a candidate for judge of the Su- preme Court, but he refused to n1ake a canvass for the position. Judge Madill was also a successful financier and became associated with a number of busi- ness enterprises, one of which was the Wiggins Ferry Company. In 1893 he became president of the Union Trust Company, which office he continued to fill till he was attacked by his last illness. On assuming this position he withdrew from the practice of law, at which time he was presented with a. handsome memorial by tHe other m.embers of the bar, which reads as fol- lows: ''Knowing that you are about to retire fron1 the position of circuit judge, which you have so long occupied, we are unwilling you should leave the bench without an unequaled expres- sion of our approval of your official career, which we now declare has been marked throughout by a dignified modesty, unquestioned impartiality ,extensive learning and great ability; we further bear cheerful witness that you have discharged the important, responsible and labor- ious duties of your high office in a manner ben- eficial to the jurisprudence of the State, with justice to all suitors, honor to your own head and heart and with courtesy and kindness to your professional brethren.\ An incident in connection with his career while serving the Union Trust Con1pany, which occurred about four years ago, was the clever manner in which he effected the capture of \1v1ysterious John Smith,\ whose case became famous in criminal annals on account of the success of the victim in concealing his .identity. Smith entered Judge Maddill's office and de- manded $Io,ooo with the threat that he would drop a bottle of nitro-glycerine if the demand was not complied with at once. Judge Madill saw that. he was confronted by a crank and im- mediately '\oYrote out a check. Then, on pre- tense of having the check cashed he &tepped outside his private office and ordered the police to be called, when the arre&t was made. '6o.-William H. McElroy of the New York Mail and Express was present at the reception given on Dec. 19 to Mayor-Elect Seth H. Low of New York city by the Authors Club.

12 TilE CONCORDIENSIS. Colonel Daniel S. Lamont, former secretary of war,. is now vice~president of the Northern Pacific Railway company and financial magnate. Mr. Lan1ont ca tne from Cortland county with a view of working his way through college. The difficulties were even greater in the actuality than they we.re in the prospect. In a time o£ stress young Lan'\lont appealed to John T. Hoff- man, Union '4p,. the governor of the state, set- ting forth his cbndition, his aims and his strug- gles for a cotnpleted education, asking employ- nlent under the State govern1nent as an aid to the end he had in view. In those days Lamont wrote a beautiful hand. It was bold, tnasculine, characteristic. It had the regularity and pre- cision of copper plate, and was read with greater ease than print. Governor Hoffman hitnself related that he was immediately struck with the writing, which he thought revealed superior characteristics of the n1an. He turned the letter over to the then clerk of the Assembly directing him to tnake inquiries as to the young man who had appealed to him. The result was that the judgment of the Gov:. ernor, based on the writing, was confirmed, and young Lamont found himself employed in the State Assembly as index clerk. The next year he was assistant journal clerk, and at this session he catne in contact with Samuel J. Til- den, that rare judge of men, who took the young rnan under his protecting care, setting his feet on that path which has led to fortune and distinction. In subsequent years Mr. Latnont became the private secretary to Governor Grover Cleveland. The governor was a large man, who, when governor, ·weighed not less than 250 pounds. In those years Colonel ~amont was slight, even frail in appe(ilr~nce, tippirig the scale at a little over 100 pounds. The contrast between the governor and his secretary was great. But not greater than the contrast between their penman- ship. The secretary's writing was bold, mas- culine, soldierly in precision and regularity. That of the governor was srrJall, flowing, femi- nine, the characters so sn1all that the words formed had to be guessed at rather than read. '80-Dean B. H. Ripton gave a very inter- esting and instructive address before the Wo- mah's Club of Schenectady, Dec. 23, on \ The Causes of Hostility Between France and Ger- many.'' '83-Cornelius E. Franklin of Albany who is well and favorably kno,wn in Schenectady, has been elected associate superintendent of schools by the school board of the borough of Queens.

Pen~sylvania has been asked for a game and H~rvard may also be included in the schedule. At least two g~mes will be played. ..

.. 'THE CONCORD!ENSIS. 13 INTE:R-COLLEGIATE. Pennsylvania has organized a water-polo tean1. Over 40 per cent. ofthe .students at Columbia hold degrees.

Seventeen men were awarded their university letter for football at Columbia .. Sixteen '' P's\ were awarded at the U niver- sity ·of Pennsylvania this year for football. In the Indiana-Illinois football game, the presidents ofthe two universities led the cheer- . tng. Mrs. JaneL. Stanford has donated to Leland University her property worth thirty n1illion dollars. The University of Minnesota has a fund of $5o,ooo which is used for the assistance of needy students. James Wray, a native of Attstralia, has been engaged as professional coach for the Weld crews at Harvard. It is said that the smallest university in the world is in Afdca, and that it has five students and fifteen instructors. Washington and Lee University requires its professors. and instructors to wear caps and gowns in class room exercises. The University of Michigan holds weekly singing n1eetings, led by the Glee Club at which college songs are rehearsed. An Institute of Technology open only to women is soon to be founded in Boston. It will be known as the Simmonds Female Col- lege .. · .. _'' The new buildings and campus of Washing- ton University have been rented by the Louisiana Purchase Exposition fo~ use during the fair of 1903· Chicago will soon have one of the finest gym- nasiums in the country. It will be built of Bedford limestone. The main floor space is to be 8ox2oo feet. The Teacher'.s College of Columbia now has six scholarships of $5oo each, open to South- erners only. Three of these were founded by John D. Rockefeller. The University of Chicago has an adjunct school at De Land, Fla.--Stetson University. Students are permitted to go from one institu- tion to the other, receiving credit for work done at either. Every winter· a large number of students go to Stetson for the winter term re- turning to Chicago in the spring. JOSEPH E. MYEQS, '05· Joseph E. Myers, who entered college with the class of 1905, has received an appointment from President Roosevelt to a lieutenantcy in the regular army. He is now at school at Highland Falls studying for his exa ruinations. There is an interesting bit of history con- nected with this appointment, which his. father held before him. Upon the death ofMr. Myers the son was unsuccessful in securing the posi- tion and finally secured a favorable letter from Governor Roosevelt to President McKinley. At the time of the president's death there was no vacancy at West Point, hut, when Vice President Roosevelt became president, Mr. Myers presented to him his own letter, and immediately received his· appointment as an officer from civil life. GIFT TO JUDGE LANDON. Hon. Judson S. Landon's associates, in view of his retirement from the bench, have presented him a copy of the \Liber Scriptorum,\ that celebrated \Fi~·st Book of the Author's Club,\ containing 109 articles each one attested by the genuine signature of its author, making 109 authographs of distinguished American authors.

These are days of unfolding, when whatever of good and true, or of evil and false, has been lurking in our life, is brought to view. Our An1erican cities, one after another, are seeking by tneans of expositions to show to the world what are their ideals and what are their re- sources. Charleston, too, finds in her lofty ideals and inexhaustible resources a cause for an exposition. While yet luxuriating \in the broad sunlight of heroic deeds,\ she has felt that the things for which and by which she has lived, need only to be known to be appreciated. Hence with the heroic resolve, which her Poet depicted, in war-titne~, in the farniliar lines: \--In the temples of the Fates God has inscribed her doom, And all untroubled in her faith, she waits The triumph or the tomb-'' she has conceived and opened her .!:. xposition within eighteen months. An analysis of the name of the South Caro- lina Inter-State and West Indian Exposition discloses a three-fold mi&sion. The astonishing development of the South and, in particular, of South Carolina, is disclosed. Once an agri- cultural state in the brief span of twenty-five years, South Carolina has become pre-eminent among the Southern States in cotton manu- factures and yields only to Massachusetts in the ·entire Union. To further Charleston's desire to be better known, a cordial invitation has been extended to all the states as well as the large cities, to be represented in the Avenue of Cities and States . Twenty-four states and cities have accepted. Secure of the past, Charleston may look hope- fully to the future, calling attention to her geo- graphical fitness to become the main seaport for the commerce of the West with Spanish America. The distance from Havana to Cin- cinnati, for instance, is three hundred miles less by way of Charleston than by way of Baltimore, five hundred than by way .of New York, and five hundred and nine less than by way of Bos- ton. Furthermore, the voyage to Charleston frorn the West Indies is far less perilous than to the gulf ports. The exposition is controlled by a chartered corporation with an authorized capital of $250,- ooo. The state of South Carolina and the city of Charleston has each appropriated $5,ooo to aid it. And while the Federal Government has not as yet made an appropriation the exhibits of the Navy, State and Interior Departments have been removed intact from Buffalo to Charleston. A tract of one hundred and sixty acres within the city limits, and on the beautiful Ashley, has been chosen as the site and this has been pro- nounced the best site ever occupied by an ex- position. The location of Charleston is much like that of New York city and these grounds, says ML Montgomery Schuyler, correspond to Claremont on the Riverside Drive. These grounds have n1any native live oaks, which add much to their charm. The one building fonnerly occupying this site was a spacious and ornate old colonial n1ansion and is a model of colonial architecture. This is now the Woman's Building and contains many historical relics and docutnents such as the original Ordinance of Secession and ex- hibits of industries of peculiar interest of women. Notable among these is the silk room which is fitly adorned with pictures of Thomas Jefferson and NI onticello and shows articles manufactured from South Carolina silk from the day of Sir Nathaniel Johnson. Silk worms have been imported from Southern Europe and owing to the close resemblance of the climate of South Carolina to that of Lombardy, there is good reason to expect sericulture to be added to the industries of the state. ..

THE CONOORDIENSIS. The exposition buildings proper, constitute ''The Ivory City,'' for their predominating colors are ivory with white trimmings. They are inexpensively constructed of a strong tim her frame work, with enough iron to secure stiff- ness. 'The principal ones are grouped around the four sides of a plaza. Although each is designed, we are informed, with an individual treatment, they form together an: harmonious whole and the entire effects lead up, by natural gradation, to the Cotton Palace, whi:ch covers over 5o,ooo square feet of ground and is the most irnposing and impressive of ali the build- ings. It has a facade of over 360 feet, brol{en by various pedirnents, projections, domes, red- tiled roofs and turrets, with a typically Southern style of architecture. Its height_ ~~. r6o feet. The motif is Spani_s.b-Ameikan, suggesting the hotels of St . .i),t1gustine, with huge 1nasses, sim pie and str9·6g contour and outlines, with enrichments ofterraces and sculpture at various entrances.. At the right of the plaza stands the Palace of ' Commerce. The Agricultural Palace faces this and contains 43,000 square feet of floor area. Opposite. the Cotton Palace, and separated from it, by a lake and sunken garden, is the audi- torium with a seating capacity of 4,ooo and a grand organ built expressly for it by the Moller conl.pany of Hagerstown, Md., with over twenty-two hundred pipes. The buildings are separated by sev·eral hundred feet, yet the three main buildings are connected by a colonade which adds repose and dignity to the design. Hitherto in Southern expositions the negro exhibit has been somewhat neglected but in this most peculiarly Southern exposition the interests of the freedmen have not been disregarded. Their building is under the supervision of Booker T. Washington and other able colored men. This building has architectural characteristics of the Spanish Renaissance, resembling a Mexi- can m1sston. Its exhibit shows the develop- tnent of the negro in the last three decades. An important feature is an old titne plantation with its homestead and negro cabins, its work - and its play. Mr. fl,radford L. :Gilbert, who has had much success in the Chicago and Atlanta expositions, is architect-in-chief; and Mr. Charles A. Lopez, of New York, has adorned the walks with sculptural groups. Among the individual exhibits none deserves more notice than that of the P.inehurst tea gar- dens at Sutnmerville, S. C., where the only commercial tea in the western hemisphere is raised. The process of picking, drying, curing and packing are shown for the benefit of visi- tors. This exposition deserves the interest of Union n1en. The opening prayer on December 2 was made by Dr. Charles S. Vedder, the beloved pastor of the Huguenot church of Charleston, and a graduate of Union in the class of '5 r. Furthermore the architect and constructor of the South Carolina State and New York build- ings is Mr. Geo. W. Ebaugh, of the class of '85. Under their auspices the exposition will become an historical' landmark for the nation. WILLIAM H. ADAMs, 'oz. A CONCEQT-SMOKEQ AT THE FORT OQANGE CLUB. A Concert-Smoker will be given on Friday Evening, Jan. 17, at the Fort Orange Club, Albany, under the auspices of the Union Uni- versity Alumni Association of Northeastern New York. The college Musical clubs and the Empire Q!.1artette will provide a musical pro- gran1me. Governor Odell and a nun1ber of other state officials and prominent Albanians will be the guests of the evening. The committee in charge consists of: Fred- erick W. Cameron, '87, chairman ; Frank Bur- ton, '83, of Gloversville, president of the asso- ciation; J. Newton Fiero, '67; William P. Rudd, '75; Edward T. White, '79; B. H. Ripton, 'So ; Lee W.

.·:.: .. { ,. ~I ' ·,, ; THE CONOORDLENSIS. 7 ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. The school reopened after the Christmas recess) on January 7·, with increased attendance and brighter prospects than ever before. J. T. Collins, Brooklyn, N ~ Y., has entered the senior class, and Lee Frazer Betts, of Catskill, N.Y., and John P. Badger, Jr., of Malone, N. Y., have entered the junior class. This brings the total enrollment up to about 130, there being about 8o seniors and 48 juniors. Mr. Stephen Stnith Reed, 'oz, has returned to school after a protracted illness. The Albany Argus says that Allan Rothery, 'oz, has developed into quite an expert golfer. The senior Moot-courts, under the super- vision of Mr. Battershall of the Faculty, have commenced their sessions. U. S. Justice David J. Brewer, '72, has an article on the Jury Systen1 in the Jan- uary number of the International Monthly. Frank ·M. Hickok, 'oz, has been appointed official stenographer for the Referee in Bank- ruptcy, Albany and Schoharie District, United States District Court. The recent additions to the fraternities are: Delta Chi, H. LeRoy Austin, 'o3, of Catskill, N. Y. ; Phi Delta Phi, Harry A. Barrett, College, '01, Law, 'o3, of Canajoharie, N. Y. Geo. C. Reiley, a graduate of the Albany Law School, was recently taken into the law firm of Bissell and Metcalf, a prominent firm of Buffalo. Mr. Riley has achieved an enviable position among the legal profession of that city. Edward F. Johnson, 'o3, has been confined to the house for many weeks. The junior class voted their sympathy at a meeting held on '\I'hursday last, and have sent flowers to their class-mate as a slight token of their solicitude. The school in general wish Mr. Johnson a speedy recovery. THE 1903 GARNET. An editorial that appeared in these columns in the last issue of the Concordiensis was de- signed to create general interest in the forth- coming Garnet. It is a difficult matter to secure the interest of the student body to such a degree that each will feel it incutnbent upon hitnself to contribute something to the pages of the college annual. An especial feature of the 1903 book, it is understood, is to be the literary department. From all accounts there is to be a general en- largement of the literary department. To this end material of as fresh a character as possible is desired. More space than heretofore will be devoted to the fraternities. The \Devil's Own\ of the Law School, and \Tiger's Eye\ will be represented by cuts and catalogues of the members. At present the chief need of the literary editor is for short stories, stories that are distinctly col- lege stories and distinctly Union College stories. There is a broad field for stories that are closely connected with the college and its surroundings. Lengthy contributions of a sufficiently high character have been contributed. The art editor reports that there have been handed to him enough full-page cuts, but he is especially anxious to secure small sketches such as could be used for heads or tail-pieces. And he is especially anxious to secure snap-shots of college views and events. It would seem that every Union man should take a personal interest in this -appeal. Harvard has an Automobile Club which n1ade its first run recently.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. QEUNlON AND BAN:QUE'T ·OF THE ALBANY SOCIETY. Prominent Union Men Present. The Albany Society ofw~lich a large number of Union alumni are mem hers held its seventh annnal reunion and diLner at Albany last week. This organization is composed ot several hun- dred substantial husiness and professional men of the metropolis, who can claim Albany as the place of their birth or upbringing. A large nrttn ber of Union n1en were members of the cotnpany of 350 personal friends who took seats at the 29 tables arrange:l n the ball room and American din1ng room of The Ten Eyck last week. Willian1 P. Rudd, '73, was a member of the cotnmittee of three~ which went down to Pough- keepsie to board the special train of Albany's sons and welcome them to Albany. Ex-Postmaster-General Charles Emory Smith, '61, who was on the toast list, and Rev .. Dr. Frederick Z. Rooker, '84, secretary to Apostolic Delegate Martinelli, sent letters of regre'\ of their ina hili ty to be present. The Union men at the speakers' table were : William H. McElroy, '6o, Dr. Albert Vander Veer, dean of the Albany Medical College and also a graduate of Medical College, Judge Alton B. Parker, Law School, '72, and Honorary Chancellor of Union University, 1901, and Gen; Amasa J. Parker, '63. Gen. Atnasa J. Parker, '63, chairman of the local reception co.Lrnittee, delivered the address of welcome. In the course of his toast he said : \ We have the new Albany depot, Broadway broadened near same, a new Dudley O~Jserva­ tory, the Bender 1-Iygienic laboratory, the new Albany hospital, wi h its pavilions and other buildings, and the projects are being advanced for a new Ho1neopathic hospital and a new St. Peter's hospital in the near future.\ * * * * * * * \ Within the past five months the General Electric company at Schenectady has opened and operated a trolley road which has already solved a hundred problems r():r that city' as well as our own. Nothing within the past ten years will add to the growth of the West End of our city as this new railway. This road is through the famous sa'1d plains or desert between hese cities, and substantially unifies with Albany old Union college, the first of the five institutions making up with the, Albany Medical college, the A:lbany Law school, tbe Dudley observa- tory and the Albany College of Pharmacy, Union University. '' Let me observe here that these five institu- tions are prosperous and growing slowly and surely and .at·e also doing thei:r full share in our educational system. \If only the State would now step in and grasp the present priceless opportunity and establish the State electrica'I engineering depart- nlent at Schenectady, asked for last winter, it would reap an advantage in educating electrical engineers with all the advactages which have been offered by the Generai:Electrical cotnpany, that in the event of our failure or delay 'Nill surely be take\ in hand by some neighboring State, to our great disadvantage and hun, ilia- tion. The bill I refer to provided land for this deparhnent, the title of which should be in tl1e State, and the supervision of this institution was placed in the trustees of Union College, which has for a number of years past maintained a de- partment of electrical engineering.\ President Stern then introduced the toast- master~ Williatn H. McElroy, '6o. After Gov. Odell's toast, Judge Alton B. Parker, who responded to the toast \Albany Judicially Con- sidered,\ spoke about his love for Albony; and told of the city's contribution to the \court ot last resort.\ The judges mentioned and eulo- gized were An1asa J.

Mr. Smith was born in Mansfield, Conn., in 1842, but removed with his parents to Albany, N.Y., when quite young. He prepared at the Albany Acadetny and entered Union College in 1857, graduating with the class of '61. He was actively engaged during the civil war as aide to General Rathbone, under the war gover- nor, Morgan, in raising and organizing volun- teer regiments. In 1865 he became editor of the Albany Express, in 187o joint editor of the Albany Evening Journal and sole editor in r877· In 1876 he was the delegate to the Republican National Convention and elected secretary of the platform committee. He was elected Regent of the University of the State of New York by the Legislature in 1878. In 188o Mr. Stnith removed to Phila- delphia and became editor of the Philadelphia Press. As Postmaster General, Mr. Smith was not unacquainted with the duty of a government official for in r89o he was appointed Minister to Russia by President HalTison. This position he filled for two years and was especially active in the relief work of the great Russian fatnine in 1891 and 1,892 while in Russia and had charge of the Atnerican contributions of over $roo,ooo in money and five shiploads of food. Mr. Sn1ith is a fluent speaker and writer and is a frequent contributor to the magazines and newspapers. George Washington was the first to receive the degree of LL. D. from Harvard.

Thus far there has been but very few members of the class of 1902 who have signified their desire to compete. Appointments will be made solely on a basis of quantity and . uality of the work submitted. It is needless to enumerate the advantages of a journalistic train- ing. Not only those who intend to take up journal- ism as a profession should compete, for the advan- tages to be derived from tqe training in writing for the Concordiensis are inestimable for all walks of life. A large majority of our public men have had at some time in their 1i ves, experiences on some news- paper, and those men have declared that they owe a great deal of their success to their former train- ing in journalism. .A.H men who intend to try should hand in their names to the editor-in-chief Address all communications to THE CONCO::RDI- at once so as to receive assignments for work.

It now retnains for the students to show their ap- preciation of honest endeavor to serve them and the college. Much is said every year to urge the undergraduate body to \get out on the sidelines and yell.\ It is equally true that the students should attend the concert. The musical associa- tion represents the college fully as much as do the athletic teams and many persons have been in- fl. uenced for or against an institution by the work done by the \Clubs.\ Just so sure as a foot ball team can be encouraged to do its best by the pres- ence and encouragement of the rest of the student body at a game, so this concert can be made a suc- cess and the clubs started o::ff well on their season by the enthusiastic aid of all the undergraduates.

(New York Evening Post of Jan. 2.) While Barnard College was unable to raise by yesterday the $2oo,ooo needed to assure John D. Rockefeller's gift of a similar sum, Oberlin College was more successful, and .ob- tained the $3oo,ooo upon which $zoo,ooo from :r..1r. Rockefeller was conditioned. Rochester Theological Seminary. was also fortunate in getting together the $roo,ooo which Mr. Rocke- feller is to double, so that this gentleman can begin the new year with the pleasurable feeling of having benefited the cause of col- legiate education, both directly and indirectly, by some very large sums. In Barnard's case it is to be hoped that he will extend the time for the con1 pletion of its $2oo,ooo,, even though New Yorkers seem to have been dis- appointingly indifferent to this great chance to put that valuable institution on a firmer basis than heretofore. In any event Barnard will profit not a little by Mt. Rockefeller·s stimulat- ing offer, since a large part of the $13o,ooo raised by the friends of the institution will be paid into its treasury, whatever may be Mr. Rockefeller's decision. In this connection it may be asked whether the conditional gift is not being overdone. That the princi pie is an excellent one need not be questioned, but to those who have the burden of raising large sums in this city it would seen1 as though the system were putting harder and harder tasks upon them. For, strange as it may seem, those who give liberally in this city are few. in number, and they are incessantly beset by those who need just $zs,ooo or $5o,ooo to complete a fund which must be finished overnight. There are many signs that some worms are beginning to turn at these repeated demands upon their purses. DQ. TQUAX''S CLASS. At the second meeting on Sunday, January I 2, of the class in the literary study of the Bible, Dr. Truax gave a lectu11e on the value of the Bible as a piece of literatun~. He showed by example that every form of literature could be found in its pages, essays, stories, orations, poetry, drama, epigrams. He read the story of Jost:?ph, an example of au oration, by Moses, some of the poetry of Isaiah and portions of the drama of Job. He then. gave an interesting illustration of the dHfe:rence between the form of the Greek literature and that contained in the Bible, giving as an exarnple a part of the story ot Ruth and Naomi put i;n the form that Homer wou]d have used had he been telling the story. The difference is that the Bible form is more simple, very clear and yet of a high liter- ary form, while the Q,reek is filled with figures and rnore ornate and correspondingly lengthy. Dr. Truax ernpbasized the fact that the class is always open to any who wish to attend, and that the lectures would be bene- ficial, either as a whole or singly. SCHENECTADY BA..NK ELECTIONS. The annual elections f()r directors and inspec- tors of election for the Mohawk National Bank of Schenectady was held .on January 14. The following lJ nion graduates are 1·epresented: John A.

12 THE· CON€10R®:\'i~N.SIS ... ? ·~-. ' .• ~~ . , .• SH'O,ULD ~AILROA.D ME,N BE COLLEGE MEN ? Under this ti tie Dr. Charles F. Twing, Presi-.. • dent of Weste-rn Reserve U nhrersity has an interesting article in the last number of the Saturday Evening Post. In the fi~rst particular Dr. Twing is of the opinion that college men who enter the railroad world have four disadvantages which he gives as, first, ''the college represents to tno$t m:en an atmosphere of leisure, of wealth, and fre ... quently of the extravagant, unwise use of · wealth. This disadvantage toucl1es those enter- ing any fo,rm of service as well as those enter- ing that oft he railroad.\ The second and '''still more obvious disadvantage spri;ngs fro.m the time, later by four years, at which one is able to begin the railroad serv·ice.\ 'J'he third \lies in that cond:ition of human natm-e which is in- clined to depreciate advantages richer than those enjoyed by one's self, and to be willing to lessen the apparent worth of tnen who have had larger opportunities than one's self. Prejudice does exist still atnong many railroad people against the college graduate. Prejudice is be- coming less, but it is not yet wholly elinli- nated. A fourth disadvantage which should not be admitted, lies in the arrogance and cockyism of certain college 1nen. One, of course~ n1ust emphasize the wo1~d certain, for cockyism or arrogance is not the prevailing characteristic of humanity itself, but so.me college men are cocky.\ Dr. Twing goes on to show tl1at there are men who make themselves felt anywhere and gives the names and views of many prominent railroad men who prefer college 1nen. Among these are officials of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, the Lehigh Valley, the Southern Railway, the Michigan Central, Boston and Maine, and others. 1.~he question will arise whether a man who expects to enter the railroad ~ervice should endeavor to secure a technical or a liberal edu- cation. President Twing says, if a man can a:fiord the time, his advice is to take the liberal and then the technicaL. '~If that is itl,lp:o.&sibl~, t~ke. the liberal and make :s p~c i.al study of such sub- jects as physics, chernibtry,, geology, e_cono.m.ics. and sociology. Sucl1> studies pursu~d in a; coHege of libera;l arts and sciences will pro:Ve to be at once liberaliziing and also sufficiently pro- fessional.\ COLLEGE TALK.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 15 D~. ~AYMOND AT VESPE:Q SEQVICE. The regular vesper service was held on last Sunday afternoon in Silliman Hall, conducted by Dr. Raytnond. His talk was based on the helpful and true view of looking upon every work in life, even though S'mall, as just as much a. duty to perform well as a larger work. Everyone has his talent, it may be suited to a very humble position, yet that position is just as responsible as one seen1ingly of more worth. A man can be of just as much worth and benefit to his fellow men as an humble blacksmith if he can fulfill the duties of a blacksmith better than any other position as he could were he a noted preacher. 27 STYLES AT $3.60.

Dr. Frank S. lfofftnan delivered an address before the Schenectady Lab.=,r Lyceum on Sun- day afternoon, January 19. His subject was \ vVhat is the State ? \ and from his intimate acquaintance with such questions the lecture was one of unusual interest. Dr. Hofi'n1an said in part : '' When we go to the bottom of the matter we find that there are three great human insti- tutions that no tnat~ can. rnake or unmake. They exist whether he likes it or not, and the only question really left for him to consider is, what can he do to develop and perfect them. The first of these institutions is the family. No man had any option as to whether he should have a father and mother. He can1e into the world as the son of so1nebody. He can never relinquish this relation, and when he dies it will probably be the last thing said of him by being inscribed upon :.is ton1 bstone. The second institution that no man creates is the church. It is t?-Ot within the province of any human being to make himself or the world in which he finds hi tnself. Everything tbat be knows anything about is the product of a higher power. He may call that higher power by any name he pleases, still he is inseparably related to it and can never escape frotn the obligations that sue~ a relationship necessarily involves. The third great human institution that exists without our making it i~ the State. This is the same as saying that every man is of necessity related to his fellows. Wb<:ther he wants to or not he must recognize their existence and con- stantly act with reference to it. The agency through which he does this is the State. In other words, the Stat~ is all the people in any given locality considered as related to one another and to other states. THE THREE NEVER DISTINCT. As a matter of fact these three institutions are never absolutely distinct. You can not cut any one of then1 off from the others and have it live, any more than you can cut a tnan up into three distinct parts without destroying the man. They grow and develop together and any injury to one is an injury to all. They have often been perverted a~d degraded in the course of history, but they can never be entirely ignored. If, however, any collision occurs between these institutions the State must do.rjinate. A GREAT BROTHERHOOD. For, by its very nature the state has supreme control over the lives, the property and the intercourse of each and every one of its mem- bers. It determines, for exan1ple, under what conditions a new family may be formed, what modes of worship may be tolerated, what use may be made of the lands, the water and the air. In its true conception it is a brotherhood and its mission is to use every n1eans within its reach to bring each meruber of that brother- hood to the highest attainable perfection and enjoyment of all his powers. THE STATE THE HIGHER. Right here we need carefully to note the difference between the state and the govern- Inent. The governn1ent is simply the agent of the state. It has no authority in itself. It has pow~r to do only what the state directs. If it abuses that power the state can justly repudiate its acts and rebel against its mandate. It is for this reason tbat all just government is of the people for the people and by the people, though .this may exist in a monarchy as truly as in a republic. It may not exist under either form of government. The ultimate basis of a just government is not in th~ consent of the governed. 1\'his will

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. not hold in the family, the church, or the state. The true basis is not in majorities or minorities, but in the highest good of the governed. E·very member of the state therefore has not an inherent right to vote for the government. But it is the business. of the state to institute such a govern- n1ent as will bring about the highest attainable good of all. The first duty of a just govern- ment is instruction as to what the public good requires, and its second duty is to restrain those who will not follow this instruction. That is not the best governn1ent that governs least, but that does the most to help on human progress. The mission of a state does not end with the care of its own members. It is bound to do what it can for other states. Here as elsewhere it is the duty of the strong and vigorous to help bear the infirmities of the weak. Every state's sphere of influence is the whole human race.\ JUNIOR HOP. Third of the Series Held. The third hop of the series given by the junior class was held in Yates' boat house on Friday night. The dance proved quite a successful affair. Among those present were the Misses Cle- tnents, Bates, Furman, Horstmyer, Gates, Strain, Linn, Lawrence, Fuller, Veeder, Alex-. ander, Smith, Greg, Van Deusen, Case, Howe, and Vedder of this city; Hildreth, Schuyler and Payne of Albany and Kendricks of Glens Falls, and the Messrs. Cri n1, Gillespie, Ostrander, W .. S Yates, Adams, Sn1all, F. Stiles, Wool- worth, Hoyt and Griffith, 1902; Hoxie, Gulnac, Hulsapple, Bunting, Pritchard, Peck, Parker, Gould and Collier, 1903 ; Durant, Drees, C. Stiles and Watson, 1904; Manning, Blake and Burnham, 1905, and W. C. Yates, '98, J. G. Green, ex-03, Collins. One hundred and twenty-five men have re- ported for track work at Harvard so far this year. CO·N;CEQT-SMOKEQ AT FOQT O~A.NGE ·CLUB-MEMBE~S Q:p ALUM:N.I A.S·SOCIATlON PQESENT. The Union U niversitv Alumni Association of ., NortheasterA. New York gave a concert-sn1oker at the Fort Orange ·club in Albany, January 17 which was one of the most enjoyable events of the season. Tl:1ere were present one hundred and twenty-eight of the alumni, and the entire evening was given over to the enter- tainment provided and the renewing of old acquaintances and associations. The banquet was purely an informal affair, consequently, there were no regular toasts. This, however, did not interfere with the merriment of the evening for there were tnany brilliant speeches and funny experiences related. It is seldom that such a gathering of men can be gotten to- gether as in professional life and many an1 using anecdotes were related of college days and busi- ness life. The smoker was a success in every detail and much praise and the hearty appreciation of all present testified to the di1igence and energy of the committee who had the affair in charge. They Y'Tere: President Frank Burton, '85, of Gloversville; F. W. Cameron, '84, Dr. Arthur G. Root, '89, and J. N. Vander Veer, '99, of Albany. The association after a brief business tneeting proceeded to elect officers for the ensuing year, when the following were chosen: President, Frank Burton, '85, re-elected ; vice-president, Horatio Glen, '84, of Schenectady ; secretary and treasurer, J. N. Vander Veer, '99, ot Albany. Among the most prominent of the guests assembled were: Governor B. B. Odell, Jr., Dr. George Bloomer of the Bender laboratory ; General A. J.

j, i i I. THE WINTER CONCEQT. A. Success. The winter concert of the Musical Association was held in the Van Curler Opera House on Tuesday evening, January 21, before a large audience. The hard work that the Glee and Musical Clubs have been doing was very notice- , able in the almost perfect time that was kept during the playing ot the selections. The nutnbers were all new and all good, and the clubs deserve a great deal of credit for thei'r excellent rendering of the progran1. The \ Winter Song,\ by Hovey, was parti.cularly good as given by the Glee Club. The quartette did wel1 in the song'' Honey, I Wants Yer Now\ and the \Ghost's Patrol\ of the Mandolin Club was especially good. The Union songs were, as usual, well rendered. In the farce, \The Ambassador's Burglar,\ while the individual acting was quite good, especially on the part of Crain and Ellenwood, the farce as a whole could not possibly be called a success. For a farce to be presented at such a concert, it did not possess the \go \ that is a very essential quality and lacked point. The program of the concert was as follows: PART I. 1. Winter Song, Richard Hovey Glee Club. 2. Talaho, Le Barge Mandolin Club. 3. Honey, I Wants Yer Now, Quartet. 4. Niagara Rapids Gallop, - J. H. Jennings Banjo Club. 5. Marching. G.

(}j.,rom the Tribune, January 19th.) In I 873 a plot of ground in Long Island City was deeded by the trustees of Union College, of Schenectady, to Long Island City, on condition that it should be used for a city hall. If the plot should ever cease to be used for a city hall or any other similar city building it was to revert to the college. Twenty-five years having passed \tVithout the erection of any building on the plot., an action was begun 1 n October, 1898, by the college, to recover the land, on the groutld of breach of condition.

The faculty are to be commended for the efforts they have and are making to entirely crush out such a spirit as it is not wanted in Union College. Rutgers- Union Debate. It a recent number of the Rutgers Targum there is an editorial on the coming Union-Rutgers debate. The board emphasizes the necessity of a large number of men entering the contest. There seems·to be a great deal of interest manifested in the debate at New Brunswick. The article calls atten- tion to the fact that Rutgers holds an enviable record in the debating field having defeated New York University two years in succession. It be- hooves all Union men who have entered this contest to do faithful and conscientious work and thereby carry to New Brunswick a winning team. Inter-Collegiate Good Will. The Concord iensis voices the . sentiment of the college when it expresses appreciation of the good feeling that exists between Rutgers and Union as called forth in a recent editorial referring to the ''Scarlet and Garnet'' in The Targum. Union is represented in the faculty of Rutgers and also among her student body and it The attention of the associate is hoped that the feeling that is expressed in the Assignments. editors, the reportorial staff and freshmen wl~o are trying for positions on the Con- cordiensis, is called to the fact that it is very necessary tha.t all assignments should be re- ported on as soon as possible after given. All assignments mu\t be reported on whether it is possible to write them or not. All copy must he in the hands of the editor-in-chief by Tuesday noon at the latest, for that week's issue. Essentially Non-Union. It is the sentiment of a very large majority of the student body, with- out doubt, that the occurrence of the evening ()f Jan. 17 is to be regretted. The· · demonstratio11 was most unbecoming and un- following may long continue to exist. \The position of the names of Union and Rutgers side by side on the title page is an evi- dence of the good feeling existing between the two colleges, which are soon to meet in friendly rivalry on a new field. We shake hands with Union, editorially, and congratulate them and ourselves on the new link that binds us, and on the pleasant addition to the literature of the two old Dutch colleges. ' ' The annual report of the treasurer of Harvard College for the year ending July 31, 19or, shows that the invested funds of that university amount to $r3,1 19,538.6I.

M. The case involved the question of general or special agency, the authority of an agent to bind his principal with- in the scope of his authority, and the title taken by a bona-fide purchaser for value. After a most able argument o-n the part of the plaintiff-appellant by Messrs. Pelletreau and Garver, and on behalf of the defendant- respondent by Messrs. Colborn and Boothby, Mr. Battershall, acting as jndge, decided the case in favor of the plaintifl~ as to the appeal, but ordered a new trial.

12 THE CONOORDIENSIS. UNION-I{UTGERS VEQSE. What The Targum Thinks of It. The Targun1, the Rutgers '\Veekly, in the last number contains a review of the \ Scarlet and Garnet.\ The artide is in part: '~No better choice of a college to join hands with Rutgers in issuing such a book could have been n1ade. Union is an institution in rnany respects like our own, and one with which we have always been on the best of terms. The joint arrangen1ent does not detract at all from the interest of the volun1e, but iacreases it very tnuch. Rutgers verse and Union verse come in pleasant alternat1on; and expe1·iences in the Mohawk Valley are related side by side with those on the banks of the lazy Raritan. \Five publications are represented : The Con- cordiensis, The Parthenon, and The Garnet, of Union; and The Targurn, and the Scarlet Letter, of Rutgers. The division of the poems according to subject matter adds to the con- venience and value of the book. This is an arrangement the omission of wl1ich has marred some otherwise adtnirable collections. The fi.tst division, \Cantus Collegiorutn,\ contains the most ituportant and best loved songs of the two colleges. Then comes \Meditationes with the two tnost protninent subjects of a col- lege man's meditations well brought out-friends and tobacco. The third division is c..Ievoted to Nature-poetns. Naturally the heading \Am or\ claims the largest share of the book. College loves in all their varying phases are the subjects treated; and the fans and photographs, serenades and college widows claim the attention. Con1ic verse, \Modulationes '~ Aethiopum,\ and verse treating with college life fill the remainder of the volun1e. \The whole volume is full of interest, and con- tains good college verse ; none of which, with the exception of the songs, has been collected before. Everyone of its two hundred pages is teeming with the spirit of healthy college life. It is a book that should be in the ltands of every Rutgers man and of his friends.\ THE OLYMPIAN GAMES OF 1904 A.ND F:RA TERNITY CONVENTIONS. The following set of resolutions V\ 7 ·ere passed by the twenty-four representatives of the various college Greek letter societies at a recent nleet- ing in Chicago of the cotnmittee of the Inter- national Olympian Games Association: ''Resolved, That we, the rnembers of the various Greek letter fraternities here present, pledge ourselves to present to the authorities of our respective fraternities, through the proper channels, the desirability of holding the conven- tions of 1904 at Chicago w bile the 01 yrnpian games are J.n process, during the n1onth of October of that year. \Resolved That we, the men1bers of the various Greek letter fraternities here present, advise the executive conHnittee of the Olympian games of 1904 to invite each of the said fraterni- ties to reconunend for appointtnent two of its members officially to represent it and to act as 1nern bers of a comtnittee of the Olyn1pian games fraternity affairs and matters of tnutual interest pertaining to the garnes.\ SENIOR COMMITTEES.

The Concordiensis Board will have their pictures taken on Saturday, Jan. 25, at Harvey's, Franklin street. All senior and junior members will be present. The lT niversity of California has challenged the University of Pennsylvania to a dual track meet. \CABINETS AND CABINET -MAKING.\ The gradual reconstruction of Mr. Roosevelt's Cabinet lends a direct and timely interest to an article which the Hon. Charles Emory Smith, Union '6t, has just written for The Saturday Evening Post, of Philadelphia. Cabinets and Cabinet-Making tells how presi- dents choose their official advisers; how nice political considerations influence their choice and reduce to lowest terms the nurnber of avail- able candidates. One of the most important conclusions reached by Mr.. Smith is that most presidents have followed one of two methods in forming their official fan1ilies: that of Mr. L,incoln and his predecessors, wl1o surrounded thet11selves witl1 party leaders and fonner presidential can- didates, and that of Mr. McKinley, who ap- pointed strong, broad-gauged n1en, regat·dless of previous political preen1inence. This article will appear in an early issue of The Saturday Evening Post. INTER-COLLEGIATE. A new dormitory, Han1pden Hall, is being erected at Harvard. The first call for freshrnan crew candidates at Yale brought out 94 men. Eighty men have reported for places on the crews at Colun1bia this season. Nearly two hundred and fifty men entered the recent debate trials at Michigan. E. R. Sweetland, Cornell '98, will again be head coach of the Syracuse crews and football. Members of the University of Pennsylvania track team will compete in ten meets this season. Williams College has received a gift for the Department of Economics amounting to $9o,ooo. Harvard awards a prize of $Ioo to the ma.n making the best showing in the intercollegiate debate team.

The Concordie11.sis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, JANUARY 30, 1902. No. 13. \THE TECHNIQUE OP PUBLIC SPEAKING.\ Dr. Talcott Williams of Philadelphia. The first lecture of the term was delivered in the college chapel on Friday afternoon by Talcott Williams, L. H. D., LL. D., of the editorial staff of the Philaclel phia Press. Dr. William chose for his subje~t \ The Technique of Public Speaking\ and from his large ex- perience with noted speal<ers he proved hitnself en1inently capable to deal with the subject. l-Ie was introduced by Dr. Rayn1ond who spoke of his former acquaintance with him during his undergraduate days at Union. He also spoke of Dr. Willian1s' warm inte1·est in Union College, though he is not an alutnnus of the college. but has otherwise been intimately asso- ciated with its sons and professors. Dr. Williams spoke of these relations with a great deal of feeling. He is an Amherst graduate and was instructed by Professo1· Elickox, a fonner president of Union and of the college faculty. Dr. Williams said that he was now a warn1 personal friend and associate of ex-Post- master General Charles Emory Smith, '61, one of Union's distinguished sons. He then spoke of his career in this country and abroad as a reporter and correspondent and having had the privilege of hearing the gifted orators of the English world speak. He had carefully studied them and their style of speaking and had dis- covered a technique that con1es to one only through experience and practice. H,e had listened to speakers who could bcarcely be heard and appreciated beyond the first four benches when they made their initial speech in public, but who could be heard with distinct- ness after they had mastered the art of articula- tion and enunciation. During the early years of Presidc:nt Elliot's administration at the head of Harvard U ni- versity, he suspended the department of elocu- ,, tion frorn the curriculum of the institution, but , revived it after a year, when he learned to appreciate its importance to the student. The art of public speaking is not easily ac- quired without constant practice and repetition. , E. S. Willard, the noted English actor, was in , the habit of repeating a certain difficult passage in Sh.akespeare's \Taming of the Shrew\ every morning for a certain period of time. A good vocabulary is an important factor in the art of speaking and no one real,izes this so much ai the after-dinner speaker. An excellent practice in order to strengthen and extend one's vocabulary is to select at random a passage from either Sha·kespeare or the Bible, and speak on that subject for three minutes. At first the result is mere gibberish, but if the speaker con- tinue this practice daily for some length of time -say SJX tnonths-he will find that he can speak with ease on any text he may select. The average speaker does not know when to bring in the proper gesture. Generally, he will allow the movement of the hand to follow the expression of the face and the phrase of speech referred to follow the movement of the hand. The proper way is just the reverse of this. Inflection of the voice is sometimes a mar to a good speech instead of being an orna- ment. Some speakers begin a speech in a very loud voice, thereby losit.g all the force of the lecture in the first sentence uttered. Others be- gin in a tone ot voice scarcely audible, but the attention of the audience becomes centered on the speaker ic. order to hear what he is talking about. When the attention of his audience is assured, the speaker may then raise his voice to a higher pitch. Sometimes a speaker's voice lacks modulation but has a great deal of force and emphasis. · These attributes made Col. Robert G. Ingersoll the famous speechmaker that he was. It is these qualities that give to President Roosevelt his pleasing personality.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. Dr. Williatns characterized the style of Glad- stone, Chauncey Depew, Bishop Pl1illip Brooks, Joseph Jefferson, Mark Twain ~nd many other familiar speakers. Dr. Willi~rns has a very pleasing style of his own, being a thorough master of expression. His sens~ of humor acts as a literary condiment to the :substantial body of his lecture. THE MEDICAiL, The latest initiate into ~ ~ IC is Oscar F. Larson, 1905, Bowdoin, ex-o.;t-,of Middle Gran- ville. There is a report that the fresh men will ban- quet in the near future. The £reshtnen neither affirm nor deny this rumor. The Law School basketb,all team has challenged the Freshman Medics and a game has been arranged to take place a.tthe Central Y. M. C. A. A bill was introduced in the C<>rnrnon Council of Albany last week turning over to Union U ni- versity six acres of land of tbe altnshouse property for a scientific building-. The junior class has had phot<>graphs taken at Levi Moore's for the 1903 Garnet. They were followed last Friday by the freslunen to the number of forty-seven and were successfully \snapped.\ The State Medical Society lle1d its annual sessions in the Capitol in Alban.y dut·ing Tues- day and Wednesday, January 28th and 29th. Many interesting papers wer~ read. The Medics had their regular work: \ cut out\ and were allowed to attend these me~tings. · The first football game ever played in the United States was in 1876 bet\\¥een Yale and Harvard. ALBANY LAW .SCHOOL. The seniors will he examined in Code Pro- cedure on Thursday the ::\Oth inst. Examinations in Real Property and Qyasi-Contracts have been postponed. Reports from Mr. Edward F. Johnson, 1903, who has been seriously ill for many weeks, are very encouraging, and it is hoped he may be able to resume attendance at lectures within a short time. School Calendar for February .-February 3d, Registration of students. February 4, Second semester begins. February 12, Lincoln's birth- day, recess one day. February 22, Washing- ton's birthday, recess one day. F. E. Smallman, of Otto, N.Y., and F. C. Filley, of Troy, N.Y., have entered the junior class. This brings the total of the class o r903 to an even fifty, and several tnore are expected to enter at the beginning of the spring term. Through the courtesy of the officers of the New York State Bar Association, the students received invitations to attend the lectures given by His Excellency M. Jules Cam bon, the French Ambassador to the United States, and the Hon. J atnes M. Beck, Assistant Attorney-General of the United States. A goodly nutnber availed themselves of the privilege thus so kindly ex- tended. Upon the petition of the junior class, repre- sented by the executive comrnittee, the faculty have decided to postpone the remaining lectures and final examination in Bailtnents until next tern1. Mr. Parker is a tnoit interesting lecturer and thoroughly understands his subject, but it was the general opinion of all that too short a time has been devoted to the subject to wan·ant the taking of a final exatnination this tern1.

8 THE CONC,ORDIENSIS. DAY OF PRAYER FOQ COLLEGES. Sermon by Dr. Donald S. MacKay of New York City. On Thursday, January 23, the Day of Prayer for Colleges was observed by chapel services in the afternoon, all regular exercises being sus- pended. The chapel was filled, many alumni and friet ds of the college being present. The services were opened by Dr. Raymond and after prayer by Dr. Carson a most clear and forcible address was delivered by the Rev. Dr. Donald Sage MacKay, pastor of the Collegiate Refonned Church of New York city. Dr. MacKay took for his text the three words \I am persuaded\ from Paul's Second Epistle to Titnothy, chapter I, tvvelfth verse, and the substance of his sermon was as follows: The full intensity of these words is revealed in the reference \ I an1 persuaded that nothing shall separate us frotn the love of God,'' Romans VIII :38, 39· Persuasion means conviction and conviction is the evidence of a man who has tested the reality of belief. The power of con- viction is a source of strength. T1:e man of conviction is regarded nowadays as a freak. The whole code of ethics for rna ny is '' How far can conscience be stretched without breaking?\ Conviction is the tonic of conscience. All great tnovernents have had the pulse note of convic- tion. Nothing good or lasting was ever achieved unless one could say in his own soul \I am persuaded.\ Character is based on un- swerving conviction. It is the soul of con- sistency. Conviction has many counterfeits. With some it means inclination. They are ruled by their likes and dislikes-principally dislikes. But strong passion means weak reason. Pre- judice is disinclination in the chronic state. It is the lynch-law of society-the piilory of con- ventionalistn. Many tnistake conviction for opinion. There are many beautifu~ opinions on religious sub- jects, but they do not touch the heart. Opinion says \I think,'' but conviction \I believe.\ Intensity of conviction approaches bigotry. Bigotry is devotion to some section of the truth ; conviction is devotion to a whole truth. But unprincipled tolerance is not more desirable than unprincipled intolerance. 1.,he latter is like the swordfish, all backbone; the former like the jellyfish, no backbone. So far w·e have considered the subject from a negative standpoint. To consider the position '' What is conviction?\ First, inte1lectually, it is knowledge born of ex:perience-wbat each one learns for hitnself. Experience teaches fools, but it graduates saints. It is the reservoir out of which conviction . spnngs. Secondly, in the moral or ethical sphere, conviction is conscience speaking through duty. Conscience is worthless unless it embodies action. \Do the duty that lies nearest you, and tl1e next will become apparent.\ Conscience should be the inspiration of duty. It should glorify work. It is conscience we need for the solution ot r11any great problems. Capital with- out conscience is tyrrany, and labor without conscience is servitude. Again, spiritually considered, conviction is devotion to a person, the allegiance of a soul to a personal divinity, christianity is \friendship with Christ.\ '' I am not talking a religion of phrases. You young men know full well the value of friendship. Friendship is real. As we take Christ into our lives, belief grows into convic- tion. Let us be friends ~'ith God. Let tnen know that we are persuaded.\ MEETING OF N. Y. S. I. A. A. At the tneeting of the New York State Inter- collegiate Athletic Association held at Baggs Hotel, Utica, on Saturday, January 25, Union was formally a warded the football pennant for the season of 1 90r. Arrangements were perfected at this meeting whe1·eby the next track meet will take place at Rochester with Rochester University in May. Captain Dickinson E. Griffith, 'oz, of the track team, was present as Union's representative.

THE CONCORDIEN;SIS. 9 INTERNATIONAL STUDENT CONVEN- TION AT TOQONTO. As the date for the fourth convention of the Student Volunteer Movement, to be held at · Toronto,. February 26 'to March 2, draws near, preparations are being rapidly hastened, both at the Toronto headquarters and at the Volun- teer office. So general is the interest in this . gathering that the utmost resources available are being sorely taxed. Colleges and other institu- tions of higher learning frotn the Alantic to the Pacific are taking steps to appoint large and in- fluential delegations in cases where this has not already been done. Interest in the city where the convention meets is most natural. Its architectural beauty, its high reputation as a scholastic center, and its dominating influence in the evangeHcal life of the Dotninion combine to 1nake it an ideal gather- ing place. To this may be added, in the case of delegates from the States, the chann of the transplanted English life as affected by early French traditions. It is a bit of England with ~omething of the Sabbath atmosphere of Scot- land, n1ingled with the spirit and enterprise of America. The student life of Toronto is like- wise a unique composite of British and Ameri- can ideas and custon1s, with which it will be most interesting to becotne acquainted. Interest in the coming convention is further justified by the acceptances already received. These include the leading missionary advocates of the United States and Ca.nada, missionaries frotn all the great fields, tnany of them w, th a world-wide reputation, and persons whose fame is in every mouth in connection with the recent upraising in China-the falsely defamed and rightly lauded Dr. Ament, and Prof. Game~ell, defender of the legations, both of Peking, being among them. Young people's society leaders, whose names are household words, will be present, as will men and women of spiritual power, some of whon1 are already known to students, Mr. Speer and Dr. and Mrs. Howard Taylor, for exatnple. Editors and educators of influence and wide reputation will con~titute an i .lJ portant part of the personnel. Best of all, Mr. Mott, whose five nlonths' tour among the students of Japan and India has been a pro- longed experience of remarkable successes, will preside. His words will alike inspire and em- power all who hear hin1. Di:fficultiei to be feared in case of a late ap- pointn1ent of representatives are suggested by the fact that at a number of remote colleges dele~ gations twice as large as were sent to the con- vention at Cleveland in 1898 have been ap- pointed, and also hy the plans of large institu- tions like Cornell University and Yale, where the remarkable record of 1898 is likely to be ex- ceeded. Since the delegates are to be enter- tain:ed by the hospitality of the people of Toronto; it has he en neces~ary to li rn it the total attendance to z~soo, of whom z,ooo will be students. From present indications, it is apparent that this nurnber of men and women frotn fully 500 institutions will easily be reached -undoubtedly the greatest student religious gathering the world has ever seen. COLLEGE DISCIPLINE. [From Annual Report of President Schurman of Cornell.] There is nothing of more importance to a university than the character and conduct of its students. But among t\-vo thousand or more young men the chances are that some will be unworthy or worthless. Not only the good nan1e of a university, but its tone and morale, imperatively demand that these shall be eliminated. No university can tolerate with impunity a single vicious, or drunlen or lecher- ous student. LITERARY NOTE. In a sketch of Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, the new President of Columbia University, con- tributed to the Review of Reviews for February, the fact is brought out that Dr. Butler has de- livered important educat!onal addresses in every one of the fifty States and Territories of the Union.

Nothing could have been better to bring ou.t any latent ability that may exist in the freshmen class. than such a meet. It behooves them to make all efforts possible to hold a winter indoor meet during this term·. Appointment to Board. In accordance with the announce- ment in the issue of the Concor- diensis for October 25 making a call for men from the junior class as associate editors one man has replied so far. The board takes pleasure in appointing W. E. Kruesi of the class of 1903, who on the basis of work already submitted, will serve as an associate editor. No new men have appeared from the sophomore class. From the freshmen class four men have registered and are doing work. Places are still open and it is imperative that all men who intend to try should register with the editor-in-chief at once.
