Con- sequently \Ve are at a loss to understand the irnportant but apparently arbitrary change in the position of Physiology in the curriculurn. From second term .junior to first term Fresh- n1an, is a long jun1p, and \vhile we \VOtlld not doubt the probable discretion of the dis- posing power, \Ve feel called on to notice the fact that such a change unexplained shakes confidence in the value of a course so un- stable. ~IILITARV drill is resuscitated, but its con- stitution continues to weaken and it promises before long to expire. It seeks to be main- tained this year as an ostensible substitute for othe1: work and by conceding a portion of the tin1e heretofore allotted. To be sure t\VO- hours a week is not much to spend on it, but then it is not enough to- effect any good, even adn1itting- that benefit could be derived <._;; \vith suf-ficient tin1e. THE so1ne\vhat animated debates vvhich took place on the can1pus after the rush sug- gested the thought that a \vord on good feel- ing in college n1ight be appropriate just no\v. Without clain1ing to decide the right of either faction it was evident that a great deal of high temper was raging on both sides. The n1en ,vere hot; hot from exertion ; hot fron1 contradicting. At such a time it is the business of each man to guard himself, and if one forgets and isn't vvilling to apologize on thinking it over he forfeits his character as a college gentle1nan. One of the mo~t pleasant phases of college life is the regard which members of the same instituti~n1 have for each other. rfouching any interest of the n1,en as a body there is n1arked unity of sentiment. No trouble could spring up outside \vithout uniting us to a 1nan. And \vell it might. The relation sustained here is but one step ren1oved from that of hon1e. We graduate into a fa1nil y that extends over the entire land. Ho\v un- fortunate, then, \vhen difficulties and differ- ences arise in the family vv hile at hon1e; especially if they be not at once-settled. For then, we kno\v, the breach generally grovvs \vider. Let us forget that there are dif- ferent classes, for these distinctions soon fade avvay ; but ren1en1 ber that we have con1mon interests to sustain, a con1n1on mother to revere, and n1utual good-feeling to n1aintain both nO\V and hereafter. WE \vish to call the attention of the au- thorities t<r the very slack n1anner in '\Vhich the affairs ot the boating interests are car- ried on. 1'he boat house and boats, vvhich should, in our opinion, be the exclusive prop- erty of the students, are very far fro111 being such. Never being- ·locked, the \Boat house has becon1e con1n1on property to all who . choose to take stock in_ it, and is at present used for aln1ost everything but that for -vvhich it was intended. 'The dressing cases, \vhich are a necessary fixture, have been retnovccl and their places occupied by lun1ber and -truck of various kinds. One halt of the house has been reserved for private parties, and the gradual depreciation of value in the boats may be attributed to their use by outside parties and inexperienced crevvs. Allow us to suggest to those \vho have charge of this matter that a lock be put upon the boat house and a restraint upon the pron1iscuous use of the boats.
