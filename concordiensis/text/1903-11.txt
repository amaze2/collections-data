THE CON-CORDIENSIS . r / I II ' ~· VoL. XXVII. UNION O'OLLEGE, NOVEMBER 4, 1903. No.6. UNION, 12 : R. P. I., I 1. The representatives of Union and R. P. I. met Saturday afternoon in their annual grid- iron contest on the former's campus, the game resulting in a hard earned victory for Union by the score of I 2 to 1 I. The game was bit- ter} y contested; the eagerness of both sides causing n1uch off-side play, in which respect l~. 1>. I. was the worst offender. R. P. I. chose the north goal to defend, giv- ing Union the kickoff. Patton kicked and R. P. I. at once started with a rush for Union's goal but were soon checked by a 2o yard pen- alty for holding which forced then1 to kick. Ferguson booted the leather to R. P. I's 45 yard line where Robinson caught it on the bounce. The latter, dodging several tacklers, after a pretty run crossed the line and placed the ball squarely between the posts for Union's first score. Patton easily kicked the goal, making the score 6 to o for Union. After this score R. P. I. scored both of its touchdowns by a series of line bucks which, backed by· the weight of the line, vvere almost irresistable. After the kickoff, they steadily rushed the ball to within a few feet of Union's goal, \:Vhere the defenders tnade a great brace and held for downs. Patton kicked frotn be- hind his line and again Ferguson started the R. P. I. battering ram to such good effect that Murray was soon pushed over for a touch- down, from which Yeager failed to n1ake an easy goal. R. P. I. kicked off to Raymond who returned 25 yards before being downed. Here Olm- stead made a fine 30 yard end run, but the keen eyes of the official had discovered holding in Union·s line, so the ball was brought back and R. P. I. given 20 yards. Patton punted to Ferguson in the center of the field and from there R. P. I. slowly but surely forced the ball over for a second touchdown, Yeager kick- ing the goal. The half closed in a few min- utes, leaving the score r I to 6 for R. P. I. From the beginning of the second half, Union assumed the offensive, showing greatly improved form over the preceding half. Re- ceiving the ball from the kickoff on their five yard line, by steady line bucking, they forced it toR. P. I's 45 yard Hne where they ·were held for downs. R. P. I's attack was weak and Union held them for downs. This was. in the center of the field and from here the march of the boys in garnet was uninterrupted until they reached R. P. I's five yard line, whe~e they were held for downs. R. P. · I's punt was poor, going out of bounds, and the ball was Union's with 20 yards to go. Tredick was here substituted for Cantwell. In two plays Harvey and 1,redick carried the ball 5 and ro yards respectively by pretty end runs. Har- vey covered the retnaining 5 yards by a pretty dash outside of tackle. \tVhen Patton kicked goal, making the score I 2 to I r, the Union rooters nearly went wild with joy as the game had been apparently so hopelessly lost. With less than a n1inute of play left Patton kicked off to Gifford, H .. P. I. had made about 5 yards when time was called. The lineup was as follows : Union R. P. I.

A person who has visited Europe for the first time must needs have a great deal to say, generally far too n1uch for a long-suffering public. Consequently I shall restrain myself, first, because space is limited, and secondly, because my subject is not a large one. It is now nearly two n1onths since my friend and I made our trip in to that beautiful little country of llolland-to look up our ancestors, so we said. After staying away over two hundred years, we the prodigals, were return- ing home. vVould these stolid Dutch1nen welcotne us with open arms as was the prodi- gal of old ? \Vould they even recognize us? These were the thoughts that passed through our tninds. But away with such fancies ! Every city, town, village, and hamlet contain- ed a VanDyck and VanLoon, and we gave up in despair. They knew us not. As our tin1e was litnited we decided that we would have titne to visit only Amsterdam and the I-Iague. Still the ordinary route fron1 An twerp to An1sterdam allows one to get a glimpse of Rotterdam, noted for its shipping; Delft, celebrated in the IJ-I8th centuries for its earthenware in in1itation of Chinese and Japanese porcelain ; Ryswyk, the scene of the celebrated peace in 1697 ; the I-Iag1ae, which I shall mention again later ; Leyden, the scene of the terrible siege .of the Spaniards in I 57 3-

;GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.-· Adv. 74; Haarlem, also a sufferer during the Span- ish persecutions. Finally after a thrilling ride of four hours through and past these historic old places we arrive at Amsterdam, the me- ttopolis. We have gone nearly a hundred and tw~enty miles h1. these four hours, for the ex- presses of Holland have no hills to check their enthusias1n. T'he first thing that one notices upon arrival is the importunity of the porters, vendors, newsboys, etc. They will not leave you and often you feel compelled by their in- sistence to make them nappy, and yourself un- happy. The second thing that very forcibly strikes your attention, is the excessive amount of water, in, around and outside of the city. It might well be dubbed a second Venice, whose limpid waters are murky, whose gon- dolas resemble those boats that rest on the placid bosotn of our Erie Canal ; and whose rotnantic gondoliers are just ordinary everyday Dutch sailors. There are ninety islands and 300 bridges in A1nsterdam. In each of these canals there is three feet of water supported by three feet of mud. Still some of its finest houses are built facing these strean1s, but dif- fering from Venice in this, each one of these waterways has a roadway on either side. The older houses are built on piles, a(e tall and narrow with their gables turned toward the street. The numerous bridges necessary are not always sights of beauty, but of course are very useful. Probably Amsterdam doesn't try to pose as a beautiful city. Each city has attractions of its own. At A.msterdam the public buildings have no par- ticular interest. The queen's palace is a very ordinary building for a palace, which she oc- cupies but one week in the year ; th~ Bourse, too, is nothing grand, the Ryks Museu1n con- taining 2ooo paintings is of course justly cele- brated for its treasures.. Ren1brandt's \ Night vVatch,\ is here the masterpiece. I have not time to tell of a visit to the Jewish quarter where live in peace a vast colony of religious refugees, or of a visit to a diamond-polishing shopwhere one may for a moment become a millionaire. THE OONCORDIENSIS. 7 A very pleasant trip that nearly all visitors take, is to the island of Marken, returning through any one of the canals. This trip makes it possible for one to for·m an idea of the country and people as but. slightly affected by the city life. In the cities, we do not see Dutch life, there the peop],e have been largely changed by contact with English and French customs and ideas. This sea trip too gives one a view of the enormous dykes and locks by means of which \Le Pays Bas ''is enabled to exist. An hour's sail brought us to the island, an island inha hi ted by fishing people who still re- tain their old customs and costumes. Right at this point I must say that the people of this section have been spoiled, spoiled by summer travelers. vVe were greet- ed at landing by a \l(um wit me \ from a little girl of ten in wooden shoes, short yellow skirt, blue waist and tightly fitting cap, from which peeped forth a bang about three inches wide. She had souvenirs to sell. Young and old are dressed alike. 1\'he boys and men wear wooden shoes and bloon1ers, otherwise they dress like ourselves. They are addicted to a very bad habit which was elsewhere very rare, they always have their hands thrus.t into their pockets. We n1ade a tour of the 1sland which is very small and were every where at- tended by these little girls with postal cards or wooden shoes for sale. I can still hear ~he dainty patter of their nun1ber 7s. The last words that we heard from the children as we sailed away were : \l\1oney \ Good-bye.\ I really believe that every person on that island can speak that much English. Our little pleasure steamer next started to- wards Edam, the tovn1 and district of cheese renown. We made no stop here, but it wasn't difficult to imagine that we were in the vicinity of a great place. I don't know as I would have cared to stop. After leaving Edam we passed through a most picturesque district: on either side below us, the beautiful green fields, divided by little canals; here and there t~e

At Monnikendam one of the children who spoke '' English \ even offered to sell the Klumpen on his feet but we begged off. Our next stop I was l3roeck reported to be the clean- liest village in the world. It was a most de- lightful little spot, combining all of the good qualities of the other places that we had seen. But Broeck, too, must be left behind, and soon we passed through the lock down into Amster- dam·. 1''he next day we left this historic old city, the city that gave Spinoza birth; the city that fostered and sheltered De Ruyter; the city wherein Rembrandt long wielded his magic brush. A ride of an hour and a half brings us to the Hague, the capitol. The city has a tnuch tnore modern appear- ance and spirit than Amsterdam. She tr·ies to ·ape Paris in her little way. Still sh~ has in a way a centre and authority of style. French is much spoken here, perhaps more than Dutch. English is also spoken, but not so well or so much.. I have not time to speak of the Mu- seums, the Painting Gallery containing anum- ber of very fine works, the House of Parlia- ment, the Queen's Palace, and the ''House in the Woods\ where the Peace Conference held forth a few years ago. We did not readily find th~ latt~r palace, but in our detours we passed a ~eld where, in the city of Peace, the queen's cavalrymen were industriously drilling, and as a climax, we soon came upon her majesty's in- fantry engaged in like pursuit. (Comments are unnecessary.) Inconstancy, thy name is woman! Three miles from the Hague is the .most fash- ionable and celebrated watering place in Hol- land.

They say I must go to you that day without fail and stand up sotn.ewhere in or near the city and tell the absolute truth for two solid hours. My heart would break if I thought the necessary change in time had given the citi~ens of old l)orp any anxiety.

My subject will be the '' Philosophy of Wit and Humor,'' and\ Stories Around the Stove,\ My talk will be along scholastic lines, orthodox and pure as a beautiful golden-haired Schenec- tady maiden's dream. At the same time, I will let out as much fun and cause as much laughter as I can without making your sedate deacons and the sensitive students of the college go into fits. Last year, I attacked the devil so strong in Albany that clergymen stood up all over the opera house, with tears strean1ing down their cheeks, and begged me to give Satan one tnore chance as they had their families to sup- port. Then the lawyers cried out to me to stop. \ Why,'' they said, '.' Satan is our friend. He pays us our biggest fees for keep- ing him out of jail and saving him from being hung.\ Then the Albany politicians stood up with their hands waving wildly, and said : ''If you kill Satan, all our beautiful salo~ns will close down, our expensive poorhouses will go \ out of business and our million-dollar pene- tentiaries go into bankruptcy. Don't do it.\ When I come to n1y dear old Schenectady I want to cause joy, so if_ Satan has many friends there perhaps it would be best not to attack hitn. I will leave this csrave question to be de- . cided by you. . If you will have a dozen of your respectable citizens, three collE>ge professors and seven college students (including the half-back in the · college football team) sign a paper saying they are friends of Satan, then I will not dis- turb him.

Union's New Library. On Monday of this week the Nott Memorial Hall formally became a library. So long has it been a building of ornament that the time seemed ripe for a transformation, or it might be said for an additional function of useful- ness. The library is certainly one to be proud of in every sense of the term. \Vith its central location the complet- ed building is inuposing and beautiful. The famous mosaic tile floor brought over from England, has been left intact and now is seen to its best advantage. Th.e furnishings necessary to a library are all new. The book- shelves and braces are of thin plate iron and extend tlle entire way around the building. Very a·rtistic library fil'es and periodical racks have been secured. There is: a dr· cular glass frame in the cefltfe of the first gallery which may serve the purpose of a ventilator if one is needed. The centre of the main floor is illuminated by a score of lights fixed on drop-rods of black steel. Mr. Brown, the librarian, is greatly to be commended· for his efficient personal efforts in completing the arrange- ments, filing and cataloguing .of the books in such a limited time. Admission for Ladies. It may seem a little late in the season to speak of such a subject but the fact that an admission fee to football games is charged for ladies has just come to the notice of the editors. The chief reason why this was not known before is because it is unusual. Tl1e individual student must pay ·bis ath· letic tax and this secures him admission to all games on the campus. This year, then~ are only four games at Schenectady, so that, in reality, the students are paying \War time'' rates for their pleasure. They do not ob- ject to this so much for they know they are supporting their team financially, but that their friends, feminae divinae, should be taxed also seems rather unfair for there are not many bond holders making tracks on Union's campus. In addition to this, the admission fee this year has been twice as much as ordinary. If the Athletic Board is really in great need of money, the Concordiensis will withdraw its protest, reserving for itself, however, the privelege of regarding the matter with mild astonish- ment.

Accord,ingly the astrologers, soothsayers and inventors got together to contrive a new an1usement for the king. At last the day arrived on which the king was to ·witness his new am,usement.

One side carried a huge staff which they were to take forward as far as possible and those op- posing them were to push it back. At the signal both lines rushed towards each other and meeting, the sound was like unto the rumblings of Vesuvius. \Vhen the contest was over, the staff was found to be exactly in the center.

LESS STUDY ABROAD. (From the Baltimore Sun}, A marked result of the creation of real uni- versities like the Johns Hopkins in the United States has been the arrest of the rnoven1ent of ambitious students to Germany to complete their training. It is appreciated that our en- dowments and laboratory equipment are su- perior to the 'German, that the methods of study are the same, or better, and that the de- velopment of the professors is nearly, if not equally, as good. A German will probably get a better education in Germany than here, but an A,merican, having the diffi.culties of the Ger·man tongue to overcome at a German uni- versity, will not, it is believed, accon1plish as 1nuch there in a given time as here. Statistics seetn to show that the efflux to Gertnany is not keeping up to its former proportions. Of the 3 7,813 students now matriculated in the twenty-one Gennan universities 35,082 are Germans and but 2,731 are foreigners. Of the latter but 276 are credited to the whole American hen1isphere.

A knowledge of language which is essentially different fro1n that possessed by the fluent speaker of several languages is absolutely es- sential to the precise and satisfactory inter- pretation of any language. Language is the form in which the highest expressions of hu- rnan thought and feeling come to the individu- al man and to the succeeding generations of men. Language is therefore the essential form of what ·we call literature, in the widest meaning of the word. The interpretation of language is the use of the key that unlocks the treasures of literature. Therefore language n1ust be studied as a training in the science and art of interpretation, or else the accurate and con1prehensi ve knowledge of the best thoughts, feelings and activities of humanity is shut out of the n1ind. 'I:o acquire the science and art of interpre- tation, the prolonged and careful study of sotne one language is absolutely indispensable. Such a study of one language is not only indis- pensable, but it is sufficient for the average college student. For this purpose it is even far qetter to concentrate upon one language than to divide the time an1ong three or four languages. He who knows one language iii this way knows something \vhich cannot be otherwise acquired about all languages, about ' language as such. He is prepared not only to acquire with a laPgely increased faculty any language which he chooses to acquire, but to use that language intelligently and skillfully as the key to unlock the stores of literature which it n1ay contain.

The atte1npt to force this way of investigating one's own familiar and native speech, \vhen the way has not already been prepared by training in sotne foreign language, is not at all likely to be successful. English therefore can never be substituted for the classical lan- guages. Among all foreign languages the classical languages are for us best adapted to use by the teacher for training in the science aud art of interpretation. This is due to the very stricture of these languages, to the fact that, being dead, they are the 1nore foreign, and es- pecially, to the exceedingly elaborate and generally adtnirable apparatus of grarnn1ars, lexicons,annotated editions, historical and anti- quarian illustrations,. etc., with which several centuries of diligent research and careful scholarship have provided these languages.

THE CONCORDIENSIS Vot. XXVII. UNION O'OLLEG,E, NOVEMBER 11, 19:03. ,_, No.7. :._o..;;.,_------ ~:MIDDL·EBU~~Y, o: .UNION, o. The last football game on the campus this . season ··was played last 'I'hursday afte~·noon. rrhe day was cold and rainy and the field in a miserable condition. There were no spectacu- ·lar plays except Olmstead's so yard run for a .. touchdown, which the referee ·would not allow to be counted. 1\'he condition of the field had much to do with the nature of the game, for the ground was so slippery that it was almost impossible to -maintail!- a: perpendicular position to say noth- ing about moving rapidly. In the first half 1VIiddlebury kicked off tp Union's fifteen Y?rd line. Patton returned the ball ten yards. After gaining six yards on two end plays, Union was held for downs. The ball went back and forth but when either goal was neared it \Vas punted out of danger. SECOND HALF. In the second half Union's line-up was con- siderably changed ; Nutt taking Gihnour's place at centre, Olmstead going to end to re- place Davis, and Dann taking Oltnstead's place at right guard. Union kicked off and l\1iddle- bury .by a series of line bucks, brought the ball to Union's thirty yard line, where they lost it by a fumble. 'fhe Vermont boys were then penalized 20 yards for holding and were forced to punt as soon as they had possession of the &~~~ leather. Raytnond caught ehe baH and tnade a good run, returning it 15 yards. Union was then penalized and the pigskin was so dangerously near the garnet goal that Patton punted out of danger. J\tliddlebury fumbled and Oln1ste~d grabbed the ball a.ncl ran so yards for a touchdown, but the referee's whis- tle ,had blown and the run did not change the -sco.re. Tredick was substituted for Cantwell ··- .. and from then ·ort UniotJ; steadily advanced the ball, but it was too late: to score.

THE CONOORDIENSIS. 9 There was little science in the game, and, as played solely by what are called the lower classes in England, was very rough, if not brutal. The object was the same as it is now, to carry or kick a ball over your opponents' g;oal line and prevent such score being made against yourself. The distances between goal lines so1netimes reached two or three miles ' extending from village to village. 1\1hen the game was suppressed. It was thought so brutal that numerous laws were ' _ passed fro1n ti1ne to time imposing a severe penalty on anyone who played or even wit- nessed a game of football. At the beginning of the nineteenth century the sport came to life again, and, in spite of opposition of parents who did not like the risk to clothing and li1nbs of their children, became popular in English public schools. In forming rules to govern the game the various schools were obliged to consider the size and nature of their playing grounds. Out of this there grew several styles of football. At Rugby the field on which ga.n1es were played was large enough to allow a kicking and tackling game. This could not be done at Charterhouse and \Vestminster, and there the '' dribbling \ game can1e to life. In this style the ball could not be touched with the 'fl:tADITlONS 01~ TI-lE FOOTBALL FIELD. Football history is a little cloucly. Shakes- peare speaks of football as a low ga1ne. In twelfth century English literature mention is made of a sport, known as football, which was played with enthusiasm by the lower classes. One historian finds that \The Greeks and R.on1ans had a sport which consisted of kicking about some kind of an object under certain general rules, and this 1nay be taken in a wide sense to have been the forerunner of t.he pres- ent gan1c.\ At any rate, it was played and was popular in England for several centuries be- fore the puritans put a serious check to it in. hands, but was propelled by slight kicks from toe or shin as the player ran along behind it. At I-Ian·ow they had plenty of free kicking and catching, but could not tackle or run with the ball. At Eton the field was very limited, and they invented and played a peculiar \ wall game.'' It is of interest to note that at the U ni ver- sity of California senior class control is in vogue. The faculty have intrusted all college property to their protection, and the Seniors will undertake to act as advisers to lower classtnen, to prevent destruction of the U niver _ sity property used by any class for the purpose of class meetings, etc. the seventeenth century.

He continued as a student until r 845. In Septernber, 1846 he was admitted to the Junior class in Union college, Schenectady, ren1a1nrng one year. He then taught three tenus in a boarding school in the town of Nassau, Rensselaer County. Returning to college he graduated with the class of I 8 5 I with high honors. After teaching two tern1s as assistant principal in R<?me A.cade1ny he was engaged as assistant at l.owville Academy. In June, 1852 Prof. David P. l'viayhem, principal of Lowville Acaden1y, resigned and 1ir. Adan1s was ~alled by the trustees to fill the vacancy. On August I 7, 1852, he married ~1iss Me- lissa Mills, daughter of Tin1othy Mills of Low- ville. He held the position as principal of Lowville Academy. until 186o, when fail in~ health co1npel1ed hitn to resign. In 1861 he again assumed charge and retained the posi- tion until 1866, when he again resigned and engaged in the mercantile pursuits. In r874 \The last number of the J ourrtal of Medical Research contains several reports from this laboratory, an1ong which are included· 'A Study of the Agglutinating Hetnolytic and En- dotheliolyt1c Action of the Blood Serum in Variola,' by Dr. Howard, and ' Studies. on the Etiology and Pathology of Variola,' ' Streptococcus Pyogenes in Variola,' ' Bac- · tericidal Action of the Blood Serun1 in Variola and in Varioloid,' by Drs.

The titles of these papers alone indicate the high order and tnodern character of the ·work which is going on in the laboratory, and a perusal of their content.s reveals an accuracy of observation, a comprehensiveness of grasp of the probletns involved, and a thoroughness of research which make one feel that could more laboratories be conducted in this scien- tific way there would be less dissatisfaction than there is at present CJ,t the disposition which is made of public funds in connection with city boards of health.''

If at .any time to-d.ay you should see some staid citizen of old Dorp suddenly chuckle and then break out into a hearty laugh, it would be safe to wc:ger that he heard ''Eli\ at the State Street Methodist church last evening.

In the audience was a large number of Union college students, gathered to welcome Union's foremost alumnus, for ''Eli'' is a graduate of this college in the class of '6r. When. he came upon the platform, he was greeted with continued applause, the boys frotn the hill getting up in a body and giving the college yell, 'tacking three \Elis '' on the end of it. ·He was introduced in a few well chosen re- marks by the Rev. F. vV. Ada1ns, pastor of the church. Announcing his subject as ''The Philosophy of vVit and IIurnor,'' ''Eli\ pro- ceeded to prove the fallacy of the commonly expected definition of wit, in which, with the aid of n1any stories told in his own inimitable way, and accompanied with his expressive ges- tures he succeeded to the complete satisfac- ' tion of his audience. · lie said that hum.or was truth, truer even than history using as examples Dickens, Reilly, and many other well-known humorists, while, on the contrary, vvit was imagination, hyper- bola, \ in good English, a lie, told for the purpose of provoking a laugh.'' · All the points that Mr. Perkins sought to bring out were so aptly and . co1npletety illustrated by his stories· that one had hardly tilne to straighten out his r IF YOUR vVORIC lS .DON,E B):~.

• TH-E CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XXVII. UNION COLLEGE, NOVEMBER 18, 1903. No.8. UNION UNIVERSITY. Faculties and Students of all Depart- .·ments Brought Together for the First Time in the History of the University. Thursday, November 12th, was a red letter day in the history of Union. The occasion was in honor of General 'fhomas Hubbard, Law, '6o, who had recently, by a gift of $Io, ooo, established a chair of Legal Ethics at the Law SchooL There was great enthusiasm manifest and the feelings of the departments blended into the spirit of the University. All plans were carried out wit~ suc.cess· and the occasion was enjoyable and fl-111 of significance. An account of the procee~ings follows : Union University, represented by the facul- ty, many of the alurnni and the thousand odd students of all five departn1ents honored Gen- eral Thotnas H. Hubbard, who founded a chair of legal ethics in the Albany Law School, and last 1,hursday night in Odd Fellows' Hall, Albany, delivered the first lecture of the course. It was the first time in the history of Union University that the students of all the departn1en ts were gathered together. The collegians fron1 Schenectady arrived in Albany shortly after 7 o'clock, and for an hour before the lecture enlivened things in State street with their college yells. As the law students, headed by the n1embers of the facul- ty, marched to the hall, they wtre cheered vocM iferously, and another demonstration took place on the appearance of Dean Albert Van- der Veer and Prof. Willis G. Tucker at the head of several hundred medicos. The stu- dents of the College of Pharmacy were also cheered. Odd Fellows' Hall was crowded with stu- dents and alumni of all departments. On the stage were Chancellor A. V. V. Raymond of Union University; Dean J. Newton Fiero of t~e Law :School, and between the;r.n .General 1\h om as H u bba.rd ; Bishop Burke, Amasa J ~ Parker, president of the board of trustees of the La'v School ; Dr. A. Vander Veer, dean of the. Medical College ; Prof. Willis G. Tucker of the College of Phar·macy ; the faculti.es of the various departn1ents ; Chief Judge Alton B. Parker and the judges of the Court of Appeals, several Supreme Court Justices,. and other dis- tinguished men, Bishop Burke opened the services with prayer, after which Chancellor Raymon<t made an· interesting address. He cotntnented· on the fact that last night's occasion was the first in the history of the university that· all the de- partments of the university had been audibly and visibly brought toget.her. He spoke of the hi.story of the university, a11d said that it was the only educational_ establishment that had been brought into existence through the instrumentality of some religiou·s organization. He spoke of the rivalry between various places which desired that the college should be located there, and of the eilorts made by Schenectady and Albany to get the college. He said that while Schenectady was successful in securing the college, the reward of Albany came later, for of the five departn1ents of Union University four of them were located in Albany. l-Ie urged that the university spirit should be cultivated and said that it was now more profitable than ever, as electricity and railroads had n1inimized the time required to go from one city to the other. He prophesied that in the not distant future Albany would be part of Schenectady or Schenectady part of Albany, it all depending on the view point of those in teres ted. He congratulated the Law School on General Hubbard's gift, end~'Ying a

Newton Fiero, of the Albany Law School then tnade an address, in which he said in part : · '' The chair of legal ethics was founded at a m~eeting of the Alumni Association, followed by the action of the board of trustees at com- mencement in ;rgo2 by one of our tnost sue- , cessful graduates, a metnber of the class of 186o, a graduate of Bowdoin and a veteran of the Civil '\Var, who has not only endowed the chair, but has further evinced his interest in the subject matter by consenting to be present with us to deliver the. opening lecture of the course on this occasion. '' As has been already announced, Justice l3rewer, of the class of 1858, and Judge Vann, of 1867, will deliver lectures in this course in addition to this introductory lecture by Gener- al Hubbard, thus opening the course by lec- tures from three of four most distingished graduates. An early lecture in the course dur- ing the present year will be given by Judge Simeon E. Bald win, of the Supreme Court of Connecticut. ''We have in reserve for the course next year, among others, Chief Judge Parker, of r872 ; Williatn F. Vilas, of 186o, a member of ex-President Cleveland's cabinet, and Presid- ing Justice '\Villiatn W. Goodrich, of the sec- ond department, of the class of 185 3· Chancellor Raymond then introduued General Hubbard, who was greeted with ap- plause and college yells. His lecture was rnost interesting and he urged the adoption of an attorney's oath, such as is had in the State of Washington, which will result in lawyers not entering courts with cases unless they have just and good reasons for the commence- ment of suits or actionss General Hubbard prefaced his lecture with these remarks : '' It is with some hesitancy that I address the five departments of this great university, still I have in mind that lawyers sometime frequen.t~ clinics. D:ean Fiero has given you: tpe 11antes of eminent gentlemen, who are to address you during this year and next.. The title of this lecture, if I might select it would be, ' A ~eed to am,end :and- imf)rove a:a~d uniform oaths of office administered· to attorneys on their ad-- mission to the bar. ' \ Mr. Hubbard then proceeded with the sub·· stance of the lecture which treated on many illustrations bearing upon legal ethics in t~e true meaning of the phrase. After the lecture a reception was held at the TenEyck in honor of General Hubbard. ROC-HESTER, I7: UNION, 6. Union's eleven met the Rochester team l'a\St Saturday at Rochester and was defeated by the score of 17-6. At the end of th·e first half the score was Union's 6 to 5 but Roches- ter braced up in the second and made two more touchdowns. Union won the toss and chose to defend the north goal. Rochester kicked off to U.,nion. By a series of line bucks and short end runs averaging about four yards, Union fin-ally pushed the ball to Rochester's 10 yard Hne from where Tredick crossed the line by an end run. Patton kicked the goal. Union kicked off. Rochester at once made a big gain by two very clever trick plays and then being unable to gain an inch by means of end plays, settled down to steady line smash .. ing, which carried then1 to Uni-on's 20 yard line. Fron1 this point another trick play carried thetn over the line for a touchdown. The punt out was poor and no goal resulted. Union again chose to receive the kick-off. By another series of successful line bucks, en- livened by a pretty 25 yard run by P'atton, Union had forced the ball to Rochester's s~ yard line when time was called for the first half. Score, Union 6, Rochester 5·

GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.-Adv. Rochester· came upon the 1field in the second ·half with the intention of winning or dying in the attempt. 'Their condition told against Union's crippled tean1, and was what won the game for them. Receiving the ball on the kick-off, they were never stopped until a touchdown was n1ade and a goal added to it. From the kick-off Union carried the ball · steadily to the center of the field, where they ·were penalized 20 yards for holding. With 25 . · yards to go and three downs in which to do it, ·they tried. to buck · their way down the field, but it was no use,· although they lacked but three yards of the necessary 2 5, and Roches- ter took the ball on downs. Rochester again went through Union's line until almost over, but were held for downs within one foot of the goal. Patton attempted to punt from behind his own ·line, but the kick was blocked, a Rochester man falling on it. for a touchdown, no goal resulting. · · · Fro'm the kick-off Rochester rushed the ball to the 'center of the field, where Union had held them for downs when time was called. . ' ·T.h.e. Union eleven received the best of treatment from the Rochester tnanagement and the kindly assistance rendered the injured · Union piayers by Dr. J oht1 H .. Pollard \vas ' greatly appreciated by the wearei-~ of the Gar- net. Union's tean1 work and interference was gqod. The .. features _of the game were Pat- to~'s three runs ci.verag1ng. 3S yards apiece and · Union's holding Rochesb~r for downs twice under the shadow of the goal posts. When the game ended the ball was in Union's possession in the center of the field .. Final score. Rochester, I 7: U'nion, 6.

'The Gj'[a,g on the Libra-ry. The appearance of a freshman banner on the flag pole of the library last week caused much comment when seen and more when taken down. Some members of the class o_f 1907 climbed the dome last Wednesday night ~t}4 _ r~n ~. _f1ag ~pon_ the. pole. .When the. s9phOl!l().T-es, on the way to chapel,: Thursday morning, discovered· it, there was battle brewing in the air. After chapel the · flag was in their possession on terra firma. and ·a lively scrap between the underclassmen ensued .. Those ~re the bare facts, so far as th~ EdUors can· learn.. Now for the politic$ and ethics of th~ situation. The students were given to understan:d last year that it was a £ormal breach of Colleg;e .discipline to ·climb the dome of the Round Building. .The chief reason for this was that the dome is very unsafe and that a fatal. accident would probably happen to anyone who .. made . the foolhardy attempt. It is not definitely known whether or not the Freshmen were aware of this rule's existence. It was most natural for the sophomores to take the flag down and it should also be natura:{ for them to ex· pect some form of punishment for over-stepping the bounds of college law. Class spirit, however, brooks no interference and recognizes few principles in its i~­ petuous enthusiasm. It is among the best attributes that a man in college can possess and yet •extremes are nearly always objectionable. The sophomores knew it was against college discipline to climb the dome and and yet their class spirit was outraged if the Fresh- man flag was not taken down. '' Now under the cir- cumstances, what would you do?'' The punishment inflicted on the class of 1906 by the Assistant Treasurer, seems a little severe when there was no malice aforethought. Considering the facts, there was no other course which the sophomores could have taken and still preserved the etiquette of class spirit. The College authorities should take into delibera- tion the impetuosity of youth. At the same time, the underclassmen must not lose their heads and make dire threats of diminishing by half the number of students here. That is foolish. Stand together if you are in the right but submit gracefully to the inevitable if you are in the wrong. A final word on the matter. Every man in College should consider it his duty to discourage the pra.ctice of risking life on the dome of the library. There are man.y other and more sensible and substantial ways to evince class spirit if '' it will out.\ It is not brave for anyone to risk his life for nothing: it is foolhardy: such a man is not a hero but a fool. ~ •I ' I I l ( } ' }

In the pretty little watering place of Wies- baden on the Rhine is a costly Greek chapel built years ago by a Duke of Nassau as a mausoleum for his wife, a Russian princess. It stands upon a lofty hiU-the N eroberg-in the midst of an extensive grove, with a com- tnanding view over the Niederwald The ap- proach to it is charn1ing. The road passes · first between handson1e villas, and then winds thr<;>ugh a thickly wooded slope, where the sunlight traces intricate patterns of gold on the brown carpeting, out of which the trees rise in varied gracefulness. Down the long vistas the light, robbed of all glare, becomes softer and softer, until it fades away in a gloom suggestive of retirement and rest much without any element of tl1e terrifying. Through the opening lane of trees ahead appeat· at last, outHned against the dark foliage and the blue sky, three white minarets, . surmounted by crosses of gold, and linked with each other by golden chains that droop like festoons. Within this casket lies the dead princess, and over her ren1ains, sheltered from the body of the chapel by rich curtains of velvet, is carved her recumbent figure in tnarble of Carrara. The interior of the build- ing is decorated with the choicest works of sculptor and painter and worker in enamel and gold and stained glass. Angels and saints, prophets, patriarchs, apostles and evangelists are ranged about the walls and above the all- seeing eye looks down from the lantern of the dome. In all that array of artistic ·workmanship the most beautiful figure is one that appears only when the priest opens the door of the sanctu- ary and stands at the altar. 1'hen is revealed in the glory of the eastern S·Unlight streaming ·through the stained glass a Christ of infinite tenderness, moving forward as. with a mes-

12 sage of welcome· and .of cheet· for the· waiting congregation. Suddenly it dawns upon the qbserver that in all the ln1agery of that mauso- leu~ there is not one suggestion of gloom. 'There is not even. a sufferit;lg Christ on a cross. There is a consoling Christ, strong in the realization of tdumph over sin and death, nlov- ing toward the· weak, the sorrowing, the err- ing, in the spj·rit o:f helpfulness. 1~liere 'is an Angel' of ithe Jtesurrection. rfhere are scenes of restorati\on of the dead to the living and of the 1ninistry of forgJveness and hope, and iri the attnosphere of this exquisite chapel and tomb one forgets death and thinks only of the joyousness of life and 'hope. God becotnes a father, Christ a brother, humanity a family, the great duty of life helpfulness.

In addition the city council has instructed officers to stop the use of high school and district school steps by spooning couples. rfhe Carroll College action is due to a report made by the police officers that there was too much kissing at that institution. Recently the faculty forbade the playing of football. There are but two Universities in Ireland- The University of Dublin, and the Royal Uni- versity. The former is protestant, and is known as Trinity College. The. latter is hard- ly a university at all it merely grants degrees upon the successful passing of its exatnina- tions. President Angell of Michigan University, has cotne out strongly for co-education. TOWN NOMENCLATURE. \Ve Americans don't pay enough attention to the nomenclature of our towns. This is particularly noticeable during the col- lege co,mmencem,ent season. When we read that Charlemagne Thompson Howard deliyered a forceful oration on \ The Psychic Influences of the Introverted Past,'' it is somewhat dis- concerting. to learn; im·mediately afterward, that J\1r. Howard hails from Bone :Gap, John- _ son County, Ill. When Miss Elizabeth Montague Gou1d- Patmer is graduated as the valedictorian of her class at the Strasshoven Conse~rvatory, we are not quite sure of our eyes when \Ve read that she is credited on the program me to Pos- sum Run, 1,enn. Towns like Bad Axe, Coon Hollow, Tai1 Holt, Round Knob,· 1,ombstone, Wool P. 0., :E-Iardtack, Willow Chute, Sorry T'om and Hard Cider n1ay be· all right as towns, but when we see a man of any pretensions emer., ging into the world from such places we in- stinctiTely ask ourselves two questions: ( 1) How did a town like that ever produce such a man ? (2) If he is any good, why does he remain in such a town ? Those of us who expect to build towns in the future should be_ar these points in mind.- Exchange.

If one comes to think of it. how n1uch litera- ture owes to the country walk. It was to that long walk outside the waU of Athens and to the long talk that Socrates held with Phaedrus under th:e plane tree by the banks of the Ilis- .sus that we owe one of the 111ost b-eautiful of the Dialogues of Plato. 'I~here had been no Georgics had not Virgil :loved the country. Horace must as often have circumambulated his Sabine farm as he peratn bulated the Via Sacra. ·Chaucer tnust sometimes have pil- grimed afoot and Spenser trode as well as pricked o'er th.e plain. Shakespeare's poach- ing episode gives us a glimpse in to his youth- ful pursuits. Milton oft the woods among wooed Pl1ilomel to hear her even-song, and after his blindness not the more ceased he to wander where the Muses haunt clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill. 'The rrraveller of Goldsmith was the outcome of a walking tour ; so was Robert Louis Stevenson's Travels in the Cevenn es with a Don key. To how many minds walks about the green flat meadows of Oxford have been a quiet stin1ulant we 111ay get a hint from Matthew Arnold. Was it to Newman that Jowett, n1eeting hitn alone and afoot, putt he query, \Nunquan1 minus solus quam quum sol us ? '' Of Jowett's walks many a tale is told ; of De Quincey, who spent his youth in wan de rings ; of William Cowper, the gentle singer of the winter \Valk ; of Thoreau ; of John Burroughs ; of that prince of walkers, of who-tn the Spectator said it was \half a pity that such a nl·an could not go walking about for,eye~ 1 f~~ the benefit of. people who a1~e·not IF YOUR \VOHK IS DONE BY~ AMERICAN LAUNDRY Vou.''ll He Plca~ed \Wi-th I-t. \'VVM5 :a:_ p_ \'Y\ULE:J Proprieto :·, 220 N'OTT TERRADE, Phone 260F. gifted with legs so stout and eyes so discern- ing ''-I mean that erudite nomad, George Borrow ; of these and rr1any another lover of outdoor nature it is needless to speak. \TAKEN FRQM THE ENEMY.'' \ Hello, Jinks! vVhy, I haven't seen you for seyeral weeks.

. I THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XXVII. UNION COLLEGE., NOVEMBER 25, 1903. No.9. N. y. u, 0 : UNION, II. some time. 'l'he first touchdown was scored after ten Union ended her football season gloriously. Few supporters of the Garnet expected the re- ·sult of last' Saturday's game : and the nlajori- ty thought a repetition of last year's perform- ance· would be the most ·likely thing, but the game was won and won by hard consistent playing and N, Y. was outclassed at every point. It is safe to say that Union awoke to her old time form a11d won out by her merits alone. Such a gan1e is the fitting result and reward of a season \vhich has had many vicissi- tudes, but every man. has stuck to his post and Bill. Smith has continuously and strenuously minutes of :steady line bucking by Union. 'The ,gains were small but sure, the attacks be· ing .directed through left guard for the most part. Patton kicked tli.e only goal made in hammered tactics in to them. · · Something was bound to com~ of it. It came last Saturday. There was not a man who supported Union's honor who did not play to a standstill and repeat. It made the specta- tors wonder why they had not placed their stray sheckels on the Garnet. 'I'he game was a good one to watch and de- void of any fouls. An account follows, taken partially fron1 one of the New York papers. Before an attendance of over three thou- sand persons New York University was yes- terday defeated by Union at Ohio :Field by a score of I 1 to o. The defeat was a great dis- appointn1ent to supporters of the local eleven ' for it was hoped and expected that the team which has been without a regular coach for the last four weeks, might be able to take a brace sufficient to down their annual rivals. The up-State eleven, ·however, played a far quicker game than New York. With the ball in the latter's possession the visiting ends and tackles would repeatedly break through to the runner and down hitn for no gains. In defen- sive ·work, however, the New York line was· considerably stronger than it has been for the gan1e. Frorn their 3o-yard line 'Tuthill, the New York half-back, kicked for a twenty yard gain. Union then obtained the ball on downs and resorted to the san1e tactics, but their kicks were blocked. Union was also penalized for offside play, when the half closed with the ball in their terri tory. . In the s_econd half the N e\v York University ltne braced considerably. Poor end playing, however, on New York's part allowed Patton to get around New York's left wing for a touchdown from midfield. 'The line-up follows: N. Y. University. Union.

'· GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.--Adv. New York, Nov. 23, 1903. Tlo the Editor of THE CoNCORD IE Nsrs. Dear Sir-Unipn's victory ove:r New York University at Ohio Field on Saturday is cause for con,gratulations and should be far-reach- ing in its effect. The undersigned alumni, who happened to be together just after the game, take this m:ethod of expressing their appreciation of the victory and of the team. It was a victory of which all Union men can and do feel justly proud, coming as it does at the end of a season that has been fraught with some disappointments. Those few of Union's sons who saw the game experienced a pleasure and enjoyed a thrill that will not soon be for- gotten and the only pity is that aH the alumni in and around New York could not have been on hand to share that pleasure. The victory in itself was much but the man- ner of its winning was more. It was clean, straightforward football, and the triurnph of a lighter eleven through that smoothness, unanimity of action and concerted strength which is the essence of true team play. For this and the excellent condition of the team all Union men have to thank \ Bill'' Smith, and to him also and his untiring zeal in the face of odds much credit of the victory is plainly due. Each individual member of the eleven is worthy of a word of praise. Captain Olm- stead was a host in himself. He followed the ball with the keenness of a hound, was in every play and his tackling was sure and deadly. Patton's brilliant run of 40 yards for a touch· down was a feature of the game and his play all through was strong and effective. Robin- son handled the ball cleanly and ran the team with rare judgrnent. showing himself to be a good field general. Cook's line plunging was little short of remarkable for a man of his weight and Cantwell and Tredick ably assist- ed him in ad-vancing the ball. Davis at left end should develop in to a strong player. He showed plenty of pluck THE :QONC'OR.DIENSIS. 7 and his tackling in one or two instances was briHiant. Every other man in the line played in a way to do credit to himself and his Alma Mater. Congratulations to \Bill\ Smith, Captain 0 lmstead and the team. G. HuBERT DALEY, '92. CHARLES W.

Thanks- giving. It is right to be thankful, for apprecia· tion is one of .the tests of a strong character. vVh~tever the past year has held for us, be it good or e'-:'il, we should retutn thanks fo:r the good because it made us happier ; for the.evil because it has made, or should have made better men of us. Above all, should we be glad that we are still here to try again. t . • The Concordiensis wishes to extend to the Faculty .and students the wish of a sincere Thanksgiving. 'Ave! Alma Mater: When Union's eleven first appeared on . . the campus this faU the thought ln their hearts and the words on their lips were: ''Ave! Alma Mater: Nos Morituri te salutamus\ and now that they have left the field the self same greeting serves as a fare· well-\ Ave l Alma Mater.'' The season is .a hard one to judge and the Editors shall make a fuller review of it in a later issue, but a few re· marks right here, whose truth cannot be questioned, will : not be inappropriate. Union fought to a finish. Every man on the team· may conscientiously be given the credit · for doing his best. Although the season has been an unfortunate one so far . .as injuring players is concerned, still there have been no ' very serious mishaps. The relations with all the opposing · teams have been most cordial as a general rule and the . season has passed without any unfortunate breaks with other colleges. The Manager is to be congratulat.ed and l commended for his sincere and successful efforts throughout . the season. As far as can be ascerta:ined at the present, . the financial situation is solid. To Captain Olmsted and to the members of the team the appreciation of Union and all her sons is due. Even now our Mother bends down with a wreath of laurel say· ing: \Ave! Gladitori; vos Saluto!'' Our next Captain. The election of Frederic C 41 Patton, captain of the 'Varsity eleven for next year meets with the · highest appreval of every student. He has taken part in nearly every game for the past three years and has developed into one of the best players the Garnet's team has ever had. He has been, undoubtedly, one of the ~trongest men on the eleven this year and the honor. conferred on him is in keeping with his ability. He hFts the hearty co- operation of the entire student body .. .·· ,,· ... ;; ' , .. ' :~ ~. ·.: ' '~ - - nc 01

The French in the neighborhood professed ignorance of the place of his landing and of his path upward, but an Englislunan who lives on the river bank glad- ly gave 111e a:ll the information desired. vVith him as with a brother-in-ar1ns I followed as nearly as possible the rne1norable path, for the army advanced up a gully which is now 'the path of a stFeam, and I was studying history and not geology. Artificial indeed appeared the distinction between an American citizen .and a British subject in cotnparison with the chas1n which yawned between Iny syn1pathies and those of the descenclan.ts of the soldiers of J\1ontcalm The site of Quebec embeds itself in the · me1nory,_ its two leyeis, its can noD- cre~ted wall, which con1rnands the St. Lav.Tence Val- ley. l\1r. l\;IcCarthy says that \for picturesque- ness and beauty of situation it is not equaled by Ed in burgh or Florence.\ It should hardly have suggested Florence, to 1ne, yet its grand- eur recalls the castle rock of the ancient capi- : tal of Scotland.

Yet these delays gave me opportunity to think over the subjects of n1y Summer's work. Dur- ing the preceding vVinter I had been often op- pressed by a sense of unrec;.li ty in 1n y stud! es, which was due, as I thought, and as 1ny Sum- n1er's experience proved, to their lack of association with life. I had then detennined to seek a pastoral charge for the Summer, hoping that through tninistering to the needs of the souls of n1en I wou lcl come again into a sense of reality, into a consciousness of helping men. I had had no instruction in preaching yet de- termined to act on the supposition that the only way to learn to preach is to preach. I at length reached tny destination which was on the T'obique River, a branch of the .St. John, in the western part of New Bruns- wick Province. Jviy parish extended on both sides of the river and my little Presbyterian '',.', ) .. : •f c t a . 1 ' ·•

An inexperienced man in preach- ing and pastoral care I had to learn to choose and present subjects \Yhich would hold the at- tention of my congregations. Educated to city life I wa~ to rninister to a pioneer com- 1nunity, sparsely settled at places, in which the men farmed during the brief Canadian Sun1mer, acted as guides to sportsn1en dt.1ring the hunting season, and cut tirnber during the vVintet. .A .. Southerner by birth and education ·I now found myself in a latitude where frost catne every night during the first week in June and recon11nenced on the twenty-third of Aug- ust_ I had, to assist n1e, my own strong h . 1' f '' convictions and the open osp1 ta tty o my people.\ My predecessor had 1nade the prob- lem more difficult of solution by his love of .n1oney which had alienated the peopl~. I re- . organized the Sunday School,. founded a Young People's Society and began preaching. An interest was soon awakened and this grew as the weeks passed. Besides pr~aching 'in my Church I had to conduct services in half a doz- en school houses on different Sundays. These, too, were well attended, with large per~entage of men. I was on one occasion invited to preach at the . church of another denomination and the brother wbo inyited me held out the in- ducetnent that I \.vould ''get the coppers,'' which immediately suggested the picture of the organ-grinder in the streets of a city with his monkey collecting the coppers. I accepted the invitation, however,. and de-. pended for tny salary upon the Presbytery of St. John. .A .... t the table of one of n1y congregation, I was once led to tnake a few ren1arks on the subject of poets and poetry. My host seem- ed interested for a few seconds but then turn- ing to his nephew exclain1ed, Say, Ort,) it beats c.ll how then1 pigs grow. So quickly had his thoughts tur_necl from poets to pig·s. Another of my congregation referrh1g to my THE CONCORDIENSIS. 13 home in South ·Carolina asked if there the cold carne fron1 the north or from the south, in other \vords if n1y hon1e \vas north or south of the Eq~.1ator. But I do not vv·ish to i1nply that all n1y p;...lr- .• ishioncrs were of this type, for sorne gave evt- dence of the truest rennernen t. I early became aware of the necessity of pastoral work and every family was visited as frequently as their dispersed condit_ion allowed. During the Summer I partook of :Uleals at over thirty houses and passed one or mor.e nights in ove· twenty. For this visiting I 1vas supplied with a horse and buggy by the parish. One night when returning from a pastoral visit I found n1yself separated from nly boarding bouse by the river. I had recourse then to tLe '' long yell ·' of Al1na TVIater to awake the slambering boatrnan. It is nee<lless to say that the call was effective in awakening. yet not in hastening hin1 and the people showed signs of uneasiness in the morning, as Indian legends are still current. Henry Ward Beecher gave to Lyman Abbot when the latter vvas seeking his first pastorate, the following advice: ''Look at the horses in every town you go to. If the .men drive good horses, you rnay expect that there is progress or at least life in the to-wn; if they drive poor ones, the people are probably inert and l.azy.\ On the Tobique the horses were generally poor and hence the conclusion was true. The region around the Tobique is 'a hunts- man's paradi~e, abounding in Deer, Moose and Caribou. Over two hundred head of these ·were shipped fro1n a single point on the river during the last season.-· }t1any notable men go there to fish as well as to hunt. Among the fisherman tnay be nutnbered Senator Proctor of Vermont: an1ong this season's huntsmen, the Baron Robert de Rothschild of Paris. The license for a non--resident of the province to hunt is $3o. This does not deter hundreds of A.n1ericans fro1n going there every season. 'l~he season this year opened on September 15 and lasted six weeks. 1

WILLIAM HooPER AnAMS, 1-90·2. ·METHUSELAH'S W ARN·ING. Nine hundred and ninety-nine· years sat not Hghtly on tbe brow of the sage Meth us;elah. Seven or eight hundred years before he had bee·n ,a sprightly youth, but noW' he gambolled ·no more with the saurians, with the Pe~tero dactyl and Bronto saurus. Verily age had come on apace. Therefore did he eall his seed up to him, and they filled all the hills and valleys which lie around Tentyra; and they were unnumbered. And he said, \ Oh child- ten live for ever 1 This partin·g word I :giive thee: Beware of the transparency and im- ·manency of the N eus.\ B·ut the Abrahams an·d the Isaacs and the Jacobs, o-ld and young, ,together with their wives -and children, and fto~ks· and· herds, when they heard this sayia·g, staod aghast, for in those days such· a saying was not in a-ccord with the knowledge of Being Ising and Wasing. It is said that a staid she- g&at, when she heard these woTds, did verily leap her cable's length. And By:zaatietts~ .c;,f the one hundredth's generation smit Lamb_icus of the acute olfactories sharply under the '1i!th rib, m.etely to -call his attention to ·the heresy embodied in the fatal words of Methuselah. And these two did straightway begin to ptun. t mel one another's features in a mannet most unsee:mly.. When the disfigurement had been wrought and honor satisfied there fell a mighty httsh on that great nation; and Me:t'huse·lah re- peated his charge and partook of a liberal libation/ But the hearts of his children were sad,for their most beautiful thought in life had been suddenly blasted, and they fell on each other's c-ervical vertebrae, wept and osculated.

No man is to be trusted. Life .is a fraud and a deceit. Ask the freshman and see if this isn't so. Oh, the. heartless trickery ! A few weeks ago he had ·no slightest desire· that was not antici- pated ··by kind solicitude. Every boy he met was like a long lost brother, eager for the pTeasure of his acquaintance,. At last the hollow mockery is apparent. · They scorn him, they rebuff him now. His satisfaction in warm .,appr.eciatioll is turned to bitterness of h~justice. Truly it is a hard ordeal for him, and seen1s ahnost cruel. :But on this subject Criticus has some con- solatory reflections to offer .. Listen. Through a)\ .a man's life, if he be of such weight as $hould be expected of every college man, h_e 'Will be sought by those who wish to gain ad- vantage from him. He may expect insincere flattery and scheming attentions. But fore- \y,arned, r'orearmed; and. it seems that the '.'r~shing'' which occupies the centre of the stage so often during our college course, should be a fairly effective preventive against later deception, if experience counts for any .. thing. Criticus does not mean, does not be- lieve, that the freshman is duped, or deceived to his harm. That's the best thing about it. He gets his lesson from those who truly wish him well, with results that only in exceptional cases are less than good to all concerned. Probably not often will he :find hin1self the object of such systematic, such subtle social attack as during the ~ays he is haying an op- portunity to make friends among the several f~a~ernities.· And. dt:tripg the other three i)'ears of his course ~e will probably be as 1'5 IF YOUR \VORIC IS DONE l~Y~ ,. ·AMERICAN LAUNDRY ·;.

He sees the game. from both sides, and g:row's .' tolerably expert at it. ~ ·No, he does not bec6n1e a trickster, ilis'h}-~ cere. If there be one thing precious beyond all else that the boy finds. in college, . it is friendship with those whom, in the searching vivesection of daily ~ntimacy, h~ learns, to 'lo~e and trust. Knowing and valuing the real, he must despise the false. Despise the insincerity for itself, that is : not necessarily those whe · on occasion are insincere. Emerson· would have every n1an utterly and continuously frank in his self-expression. No man who lacks omniscience shall dare to follow this precept., 'Ve are so blind, so changeable. In common human kindness one should often appear what others wish him to be ; should conc'eal im- pulses of dislike ; should artificialiy build a· 'road that may facilitate mutual appreciation.: 'rhe boy tnust learn to ''make'' friends, not wait for them to :find hi1n. It's a hard lesson, full of disappointment, not free from disgust. Bnt it seems wrong not .to learn it. The boy is fortunate in being .able. to study it harm- lessly here.-EXCHANGE. lt has long been the custom at Heidelberg for the freshmen and sophomores to indulge in a class fight ; but this year, in keeping with twentieth century progress, the custom was changed, and a reception was given to the freshmen class.
