At the beginning of the second half, Union got the ball, a:nd made considerable gains, bringin6 the ball to the thirty-five-yard line. Doran Brown then .m.ade a field goal, w'hich was Union's only s-core. Wesleyan then made two more touci1·· downs, kJcldng the goal in each instance. The- lineup was as follows: Union. Wesleyan ...

Although the s•core may not indicate it, neverthele-ss it was a· good game, and one wh.ich no Union 1nan need be ashamed of, for- our team played .steady, consist- ent ball. Moreover, Wesleyan this year has tht:'} best team that she h~.s turned out in years, as is shown by the fact that Joy, their great fullback of last year, whose stature and playing drew so much attention here last year, has been replaced by a better man, and is now playing on. the line. One may ju·dge for himself the comparative weights of the two teams, when he learns that Wesleyan, from ta-ckle to tackle, averaged one Right guard. hundred and ninety-five pounds, and that their Brown · · · · · · · · ... · ..................... Durlir..g fullba.ck, who carried th-e ball for them almost ev-ery time, must have weighed over two hundred and twenty, according to the estimate of one vf our men. Therefore, for our team we have no excuses to offer, nor apologies to mal\.e, for they were simply outplayed and outweighed. Before t'he game, the announcement went ont that four of Wesleyan's best players ·would ~)r? unable to parti-cipate in the ga.me. Thp · faculty reconsidered this, however, and allo\ved the men to play. Most of W 1 esleyan's gains were made aroun,i the ends by White, their fullback. As ''Heckie'' said in College Meeting, their interference was so strong t~at it was almo-st impossible to break it up, and when this was done, it \vas e~ten then a hard task to down the runner. White also made three of their four touchdowns. Union worked the forward pass and end run with fairly good success. When the hall . was once lost, however, it was almost impO$S~ible to regain it. ··. In the first half Wesleyan m,a:rle two touch- downs, the second coming just before the whistle blew, making- the score twelve to nothing. Right t;:tekle. Irish, Dunbar Right end.

The first event was the 10·0 yds. dash. The entries were: for 1912, Riley a:nd :Slade; 1'913, Stockwell and Spearman. Riley got a way in good style and steadily increas·ed his ltad all the way down t'he field, winning by a safe margin in 11 2-5 sec. The one mile was a ta:me affair, there being only two entries and both of them Freshmen: Rogers and LeBarron. The event was won by Rogers. Wfrestling furnished some hotly contested bouts. There were nine bouts scheduled; 3 i!l the heavy weig'ht class, 3 in the light weight anrJ 3 in the mid·dle weigl1t classes. In the light weight the Sophomores had the better of the argument winning one 1na tc11 and getting one by default. Dennis was declared winner over Schulman after a stubtorn contest. Chapman won by default. Cronin defeated R~ley in what was probably e~e most spirited bout of all. Tht:l pair were about evenly match€·d as to height, but Cronin had a slight advantage in weight. In the middle weight class the Freshmen made a C'1 ~an sweep a~ though none of the bouts was won wit~~out a hard figl1t. Stoller defeated Slade. Blodgett won from Shaw, and Braman from Cow- ard. Tho heavy weight seemed to have faileJ th.e Sop'homores ·fer Westcott was th.e onty one en- tered in that class. Jasper ·stewart was his op- ronent. Despite the much greater height and '\'eig·~~t of the frr:~shmen, Westcott made one of '-' the pluckiest fights of the afternoon before he was thrown. T·b e other bouts went by default to Bryere '13 and Kline '13. By the sy~tem of scoring adopted, each wrest- Jjng bout counted 5 points. First place in the 10·0 yds. dash and the mile also counted 5. ·rhus 191:3 now '1' ad 40 p6ints; 1912, 15 points. Next was the relay race c:ounting 10 points. The race was run on the football field. Each c1.ass ha·.i ejgbt n1en entered, each man to run one stretch of 110 yds. The na1nes of the m~TI in the order of running follow. 1912: Hand, Ruprecht, Van Aernam, Mann, Lawsing, S'lade, Coward, McDennott; 1913: Cronin, T'iedeman. \SKE-DADDLE TO HAMILTON.\ \

Although the teams were very evenly matched as a whole, 1912 was able to gain ground :slowlY but surely and won by 20 yds. This event brought '12 u~p to 25 points, still 15 behind the Freshmen. . Interest now centere.d in th.e \tug-of-war.\ Twenty:.five m.en from· each class lined. up oppo· site each other on the rope. At the ·crack of the pistol the tugging and straining begafl. For the first u1oment or two it was nearly even, then the rope began to ·creep toward the Freshmen inch by inch and at the end 1913 had won by a safe margin. Last but by no means least was the football game. The Fr:,es'hroen had won the meet in any evant, since the 20· points for the game could not overcome their lead of 30 points. But this fact in no wise ·detracted from the zeal of either team. In the first half the Freshmen defended the soufh goaL Ripton kicked off to Wilcox who re- turned tbe ball ten yards. ·· The- remainder of the first half the ball was kept in 1913's territory the greater part of the time. For 1913, Spearman, Stockwell and Cronin were especially strong; wl1ile Bische. O'Lauglllin, Hequembourg, McDer- mott and Griffin played a good. g,ane for H:e Sop :1omores. The first half t:nded with the ball on the F'r~srmen's 40 yd. line.

The system has been tried. prevl- ously but not until t'his year has it been votec! by the faculty. A new building for the dental school of Har- vard has been opened recently. It is ·connecte<t by an underground passage with the medical school. The building contains in infirmatory, three operating rooms and connecting wards.

Because of the fact that the game is played off or the campus, the team will not have as hearty actual support as it had last year but we are able to help it very gr,eatly by going with the team when it makes the trip to Hamilton. That wiU be the only way we can air! t'hem and we can surely do that. All the stu- dents should plan on. going with the team and should not only think about it but also make deft~ nite arrangements to do so. We should go up there with at least two hundred fifty men anJ we can if each one will take it upon himself to think seriously about it. The team is constant•.v being strengthened an.d the injured ~men are get- ting back into the game so that the team wiH be in exceBent condition to roll up a good score against tl1e Buff and Blu€. Let us do our part l·y showing that we are behind them every minute. The annual contests between tb e UN D~ER.C LAS'S two underclasses have again CONTESTS been held and much interest was shown by all from start to finish. They were carried off very much more syste- matically than before and n1uch credit should be .given Dr. Mac for the manner in which he con- ducted them. If suc·h a scheme of contests can be substitutBd for the more harmful rushes an<l scraps the college will be greatly benefited and n. more friendly feeling will grow up between the classes. They also s·erve as a mans of bring- ing out some material for football that might not get out otherwise for every year the annual game makes the men carry on regular practice for some time before. The whole effect of the sports is especially helpful and they deserve support from all. Very Eeldom do we make any 0 U R mention, editorially, concerning ADVERTISERS the business men and companies that advertise in the Concor-di- ensis. But it seems but fair that we should do so, f.or it will help the merchants and will also help the Concordy. It is, to a very great extent, far \SKE-DADDLE TO HAMILTON.\

Dwring the course of the year the students do a great amount of trading with th·e various stores in the city, and so we have a right to expect them. ' ·to help us in the matter of advertising. We ask a H .the students to look over carefuUy the adver- tising section and become fam.iliar with those who advertise, so that they will patronize those wilo are most willing to help the paper. It is hardly right to ask anyone not to trade with a merchant who does not advertise, but it is right to ask all to do most of their trading· with those who do advertise with us. If that condition can be under- stood, as we are sure it will he, the students will be doing the Concordiensis indirectly a very great good and one that will enable us to publish a bet- ter :paper than w-e could otherwise. Just he::tr it in mind and trade with those whose ads you find in the paper. THE MUSEUM IN THE ROUINID BUILDING. The museum is open to visitors every Monday from 2 to 4 P. lY.I., and every Saturday from 11 A. M. to 1 P. M. Tllere· are many interesting spee!- mens 'here, including the Wheatley ·collection of minerals> which is the second best ·collection in tl1e country, and a collection of Vermes, which. L3 second to none. 'There is also a large collection of Mollusks, Pisces, A Yes, and Mammals an~t many specimens of historical interest, natione~' and college, such as a ball fired in the battle or Lak·e Champlain, the stove invented by Dr. Nott with t'he patent, and even the three-wheeled cbar· iot used by him while President here. All thes(l prov·e to be extremely interesting, and the d.e- :Partment not only invites the students and the friends of the colle.ge to inspect them, but urg9S them to . mak<;J many visits to the museum anJ recome famili~r with the many interesting and valuable things to be seen there. Gre;;tt labor and expense havo been expended in putting· the n useum in its present good condition and it is hoped that many will avail themselves of the op- portunity of seeing these collections and .speci~ . mens. CO:LLE.GE 'MEETING, OCT. 25. After si;nging of .Alma Mater, President Cavert called the Jlileeting to order. \Hecky\ gave an account of the game with W•es- leyan, sayi11g that the team played well, and are not di·sgraced by being beaten by such an oppon- ent. Ee told of the ·difference in weight of th:e two teams, and the style of football played by the Wesleyan team. The Union team made a be~ ter showing than Hamilton did against -~resleyan, and th.us .Jinuch encouragement is given for next Saturday's game. M.ead,. '09, then gave a detail ac-count of the progress ·b'eing made on the \gym\ movement. Cha.ffee spoke concerning \Concordy\ subscrip- tions and e:xtended the time of payment until Wednesday- noon. Cavert appointed Charest, '10, as the senior mem- ber of t'h:e committee on elass caps, and asked the different elass presidents to appoint a man for this committee. The Ji\':reshmen were held a moment after the regular neetjng when a committee from the Terrace· Council spoke tG> them concerning im- portant 111atters. WEEKLY CALENlDAR.

Sixth ·lnte:rnational Convention, Bochester-Thlree Delegates F~ro·m Union. In the great Convention Hall in the City of Rochester, at three o'clock on the afternoon of Deeember 29E1, Mr. John R. Mott will caH to ord.er the Sixth International Convention of the Student VoJunteer Movement for Forei~n lVlis- sions. This ·Convention wiH be one of the most in1portant student gatherings that has ever been 'held. B.eginning on the afternoon of Decen1ber . 29th, it will continue for five days, ending witl1 the evening session on January 2nd. At E.is time three thousand delegates from more than seven h-undred institutions of higher learning will spend five days in conference with student lea:ders from all over the world. Tht?. present situation in t'he Orient, the Near East, Africa, South An1erica and other lands~ will be athletic, literary, religious, social. College spirit runs high an-d the intercollegiate tie 1s 'm.igntily ·' strengthened. It is a Hberal education in itself to meet n1en of every type, race, an.d :widely vary- ing experience, .such as will be at Rochester. Per- sonal friendships will be formed to last a life .. time; world leaders m·et whose ac:}Uaintance and work will leave an impression never to be for- gotten, and viston.s of world-wide service seen J. -. -~ that will lift .. many a life from me(liocrity to 'heights of enduring fam,e. The missionary enterprise to-day commands an. annual expenditure of over $22,0·00.,000. Grer.t numbers of men and women are taking up the work. Since Ere birth of the Student Volunteer Movement in 1886 more than 4,0·00 student volun- t~,ers from American anct Canadian colleges alone have gone to th.e foreign :&eld. The Mov€ment has spread to other countrirs, so that now more than 138,000 students and professors in Great r, viewed, vvith the purpose of ascertaining what Britain, AustraUa, France, Germany, Switzerland, contribution the colleges of North An1erica can Sweden, Norway, Denmark, India, Ceylon Italy, and oug:1t to make toward the solution of sociaJ, pclitical, industrial and reli~ous problems now confronting these peQJJles. ' 011rs i~ a day of conventions, and Ror.hester i& justly famous as a rendezvous for great gather- ings of people who 'have a common aim, b11t neither the present generation of college st.t1- donts, nor even tlle City of Rochester itself, has seen anything that for potential power and fut11rA infhience can c;ompare with tJ.ese great quad- rennial assen1 blies of college men and women who come from Gvery part of our country and from the natjons of the world. T'here have been five sin1ilar conventions: Cleveland in 1891 Detroit in 1894, CJeveland ag::d11 in 1898, Toronto in 1902 and NaslJVille in 1906 The great growt'h in the attendance, increasing from 680 delegates in 1891 to 4;235 in 1906-when more than 1 500 registrations were rPturned be- Japan, C'hina, and South Africa are unite-d with those of North -Americ~ in the World's Student Christian Federation, working togethor to spread t:1e Gospel of love and service. Th·ere is a rapidly increasing demand for more and better trainod workers. During- the past few month'S there have been definite openings for civil engineers; mechanical and electrical engineers; sanitary and steam engineers; chem- ists, teac'hers of physics and m.athematics, biology, philosophy, n1anual training agriculture, music. French, German, Englisn, a·ccounting and com· m·erce; physical directors, coaches for athlPtl<~ teams; architec·:s, business managers, paintei <:;, steno~raphers, practical farmers, physi~ians and surgeons,· and ordained preachers in great num- bers. And for\ women physicians physical di- rectors, nurses, stenographers, Bible tea·cbers, anj specialists to teach biology, math.ematics, · m.usic, ':'~nse tbey could not re accommodated in N1sh- and kindergarten, in schools and colleges. Chris- ville-is striking evidence of the widespread in- tian students who want further info!'Ination re- te-rE'st aroused among the undergraduate body. T·he attendance at· Rochest .;r will be limited to 3,00·0 delegates; the careful selection thus made necessary will insure a personnel that for char- acter, present influence and future possibility ba& never been equalled.

We think. that a series of such a.rtieles will be of considerable interest to all students .and to t'he alumni as. well. Most of the articles will be written by present professors here and prominent alumni who have been in· personal contact with the old professors and who are well qua.lified to give us interesting facts and anecdotes concerning their lives. We can assure all that they will be well worth carefnl odicals dealing with the work. All delegates are to be entertained in th~ homes of Ute citizens of Rochester, and elaborate preparations are now under way to make their visit memorable. Rocheeter is a ci.ty of unusual I beauty, and her people are famous for their hos- pitality. A royal good time is assured. Reduced rates 'have been granted on an lines entering Rochester, and by the lines in several other traffic associations. It ,is expected that nearly if not all the lines in the United States will make shn.ilar -concessions. The number of ~delegates from each college is necessarily limited. The basis of representation is one professor an~ fwo students for eve-ry in- stitution and one additional student for each 200 students, or fraction thereof, above the first 200 ~tudents in th·e college. According to this basis Union will be allowed three student delegates and one delegate fr()m the f::teu1ty. Our Y. M. C. A. is plannins to have our full quota of ·dele~ gates, and is now considering who are the strong· est and ablest men that snou.1d attend this eon- vention, w11ich promises to be tne greatest student · rea.ding. The first arti-cle in the series will be one entitled, \Eliphalet Nott, D. D., LL. D., Remi- niscences,\ and written by Judge N. C. Giffin, a member of the class of 1859. Th-e artic1e is very well written and gives us many ideas concerning the life and habits of one who has our love and. esteem because of what he' did for Old Union in the days of its infancy. This article will be com- menced in a bout two weeks and · will serve we a as an introduction to this series of articles.· gathering ever 'held. The wonderful significance of the convention is evidenced by tbe fa-ct that t11e Rochest(~r .Chamber of Commerce has tal\en the matter ul), and is planning to provide free entertainment for all delegates in the ho1nes of the city. ---- BIOGRAPH IC·AIL SERIES.

Last Saturday and Sunday ex-President George Alexander was again on the \hill.\ He came up from New York City solely for.- ti1e pHrpose oi being with the fellows once more and of speaking at t'ho Sunday vesper service. Everyone should appreciate the efforts put forts by the Christian Association to persuade Dr. Alexander to ma.ke us this visit. He took for the topie of his talk Sunday afternoon, the subject, \The College Man in the Minis_try.\ He sa.id· that while he tbougl1t that the ministry was the noblest of callings, he had no desire to influence anyone who f€lt that he already had a call to engineering worl~ or any other profession. His talk was very interesting and was filled wit'h illustrations drawn from his own personal experience. Present at Y. M. C. A. Reception. Saturday evening Dr. Alexander was one or the speakers at the second fall reception given to the students by the Christian Association. He talked informally about affairs in 1 Niew York City, and spoke particularly about the political can- ditions. Professor Bennett also gave a humorous talk on his travels in Gree-ce .. The reception was well attende·d by the stu- dents, many of whom were especially attracted by the refreshments,-doug'hnuts, apples, and sweet cider, which were served by the Associ::t· tion. Evorybody came with an empty stomac~1 and there was little trouble in disposing of two bl:shels of apples, 50 dozen doughnuts, and ove:Y hBlf a barrel of cider. Dr. Vander Veer to Speak Next Sunday. Next Sunday afternoon Dr. Albert Vander Veer of the Albany Medical Department will speak on the subject, \The Christian College Man in Medi cine.\ Dr. Vander Veer has a Doctor's degree from Union and is well qualified to speak ou this subject. He was a surgeon in the United States army during the civil war, and for several years \'as rean of tbe Medical Oollege. He is at pres- ent the surgeon-in ... chief of the Albany Hospital. PRESS C·L.U B. This smaJI body of enth:usiastic fellows is do- ing as much work for the benefit of our Alina Mater as any other organization, athletic or other- wise. All of th.e committees have important work to do and th!ey do it well. It is probable that the picture calendar which was proposed will be definitely decided' upon ve.cy soon. tR will sell for one dollar. The committee appointed for the purpose has been to the vari- ous houses .seeing how many calendars m.ight be sold and reported favorably at the meeting last We·dnesdHy ev.ening. 'T:he photograph ·committee has takeQ pictures at all the football games and; besides sending them to various publications, has been printing :postal cards. The latter have been going- rapi:dly but the students could support tl1 t :project better and eac'h fellow should bt-:y as many as he can possibly utilize and a few more in the: bargain. An effort has been made to have then1 on sale in the ·college office and, no doubt, in the near future everybody will be able to get them there for five cents each and six for twenty-five cents. The cards may now be ordered from any member of the club. All the football g-ames 'have been boomed ly tl:!e several committees. The advance work com- mjttee sends ar\Uc1es concerning the team tn ma.gazines and newspapers, especially tbose in the towns where games are played. Post cards are sent to all alum~ni living within a reasonable radius from the towns where the team plays, an- nouncing the games and booming them. to a great extent. A report of the Rochester gam.e was wired to tho New York papers and the AssociateJ Press but our visitors brought a newspaper man witb them and his reports were given precedenc~ to ours.

To publish a bool\: with all the songs properly harmonized for piano and ma]e voice is a herculean task.

In one of the poorest exhibitions of footb::l.IL seen on the Cadlpus for a long time, Middlebury was defeated by the score· of eighteen to six. The ' poor showing of the Garnet team was undoubted- ly due to the fact tfiat for the last two we!~:k<:; they 'have had no scrub eleven to practice with. In the last fifteen nlinutes of play, howeve-r·, Union took a brace, and scored their three tou<'h~ downs, after Middlebury had taken the lflRd, mtil after they had realized. that their chances of win- ning were sligilt. T·he team then made Ion~ gains in any play they undertook. Straight f~Jot· ball was the principal kind of play, made neces- sary by the fact that many of the players were substitutes, and that, consequently, no trick plays could be attempted with any certaintv of sucC?es.:;. ·The attendance on the part of the studentR ''ras very small indeed, only half of the bleachers b?- ing occupied. Acro·ss the· field, however, thP re served seats were well filled. 1 T'he game began s'hortly after thrE:le o'clnck with Union defending the north goal; ''fiddle- bury, the south. \Hank\ Stewart kicked off to Middlebury, who ran the ball back about fifteen yards. Being unable to gain, Middlebury punted to the right side of the field, the ball going out of bounds. Here \Stew\ injured his knee, which has been in bad shape all t'he season, and was forced to retire, Smith taking his place as full- back, while Kriegsman filled Smith's 'Place as halfiback. Middlebury recovered the ball on Union's failure to make gains. Two end runs harl. worked well, W'hen a double pass was tried, the runner going around Union's left end for about twenty yards, wh·en he was finally tackled. This brought t·he ball to Union's five-yard line; but Union got the ball on a fumble.· Sellnow repJaced Mann at this point of the game. ~ Brown then made a long punt. Middlebury covered it well, and brou.gh:t the :ball to Union's twenty-yard line, only to los€ it on downs. Brown again kicked, returning the ball to the middle . . . of the field. Middleibury _seeTil.ed un.abl~ to gain ground except on trick plays; consequently Union recovered the ball. Dewey then made a great run around Middlebury;s 1 €ft end, being finally tackled on the sidelines. By line bucks Union repeatedly made downs, S1nith going through cen- ter for- big gains. Mid-dlebury recovered the ball on their five-yard line, an.d _ immediately _punted to Shutler. Union held th.e ball on Middl~bur~'s ·, twenty-five-yard line, w'hen the ilalf ended. . . Union came upon the field wfth the same line- • • ... ~. •• 'l.. i .. • up that finished ·the first ·half. Brown receiYed Middlebury's kick-off and ca~rl~d the ball back about ten yards. Being nnable to gain, Union punted to Middlebury, who, in the same situa-· tlon, was forced to kick back to Union. Shut- ler missed the punt, Barnes of Middlebury fg,Jling • • 1 • ~ upon the ball. Middlebury, with the ball on Union's twenty-yard line, atte·mpted a forward pass wilich Dewey broke np by eatc'hing the ball. Union then worked the ·forward -pass for a gain of twenty yards. Upon. a fake pass around Union's right end, Shutler tried a left onside kick, which struck one of tbe Union line men upon the back, thus pe11alizing Union. Leonard of Middle,bury got the ball just as the umpire blew his whistle. The whistle so confused t'he Garnet eleven, who thought that the ball was to be brought back for .the penalty, that all save Shut- ler stopped playing. Tlle runner, however, chose the run rat:her than the penalty, and, with a clear field, made the touclu:lown, closely pursued by Shutler. The goal W3:E! kicked, giving Middlebury the lead by six to noth.ing. ·Henceforth throughout the game, Union played great ball, with the r€sult that Middlebury was unable to make -downs. even once.

,, ':: THE O:ONCORDIENSIS put in as halDback in place of Dewey, J. Stewart going in Brown's place as right ta-ckle. Miller and Dunbar were' substituted ·for Irish and An· derson; w!hile Riley repla·ced Kriegsntan. Smith kicked off to Middlebury, who, after making no gains, punted to Shutler. Union then worked a forward pass successfully. Middlebury, having received the ball on a fumble, again p~nted to 8hutler. Riley was sent around Middleb-ury's left end for a big gain, and, on a delayed pass, carried the ball through their right line, thus bringing the ball to their fifteen-yard line. Shnt- ler then covered the remaining distance in a long end run, Brown kicking the goal. With the score tied 1Middlebury made a fancy kickoff to Brown. ·Then, by repeated onside kicks and end runs, the ball was brought to Mid- dlebury's twenty-yard line, w11er~ Brown was un su.ccessful in his try for a field goaL Middlebury then kicked from their twenty-five-yard line to Shutler, who brought the ball back a long dis- tance. Here Micks was sent in as fullback. Union gained ground on a forward pass, Shutler to Brown, and on ·Riley's end runs. Micks then carried the ball five yards for a touchdown . .S'hut· Ier kicked the goal, making the score twelve to nothing in Union's favor. From the kick-off to the touc1ldown only three minutes were needed. Brown was pushed over the goal, Shutler making the last score ·bY kick- ing the goal.

In speaking of thia idea Dr. Richmond said that he means it and earnesly hopes that the students will take him at his word. He said that he does not want anyone to feel obliged to :call but t!hat he wants them to feel that tlley .are most welcome at a:n.y time. He expressed the wish that those me·n especially would call who are not members of any frater- nity. His purpose in doing this is that he may get into personal touch with all of the students and so 1become the personal friend of everyone in college. It is an excellent plan and one whict1. g'hould meet t:he a.pproval of the students. \Prexy'' has shown us that he is one of us and our friend and now it is ''up to us\ to show him that we fully appreciate what he is doing.

Mac spoke a few words urging the quitters to become sUckers. He also said that at least three hundred rooters should back the eleven at Ha.milton. A. C.

He laid strong emphasis upon the bad showing of -the team in general against MiddJebury, saying that the score should have been dou 'bled, that the fel- lows are not backing the eleven properly, but are quitting w~h en they see no chance of making a TT, and that men should be out tilere for the good of the college and themselves, !lot to ·make a lT.

Ric.e, celebrated the completion of fifty years of active work in t'he service or the American Sund·ay School Union. The event was fittingly celebr.ated: at that time by the managers of the Union who gave a banquet in his honor and paid hin1 due respect in other ways. Im.mediately after his graduation from collegE· Dr. Itice offered himself to the service of t'he Sunday :Sc.hool Union. From 1854 to 1859 .he was enga.g:ed in the work of forming Sunday Schools, first in the upper kdironda.ck region, and then along the Wisconsin River. In 1859 he was sent to tbe Northwestern States as a pern1anent mt'3- sionary. After serving there for over twelve years, during w'hich he organized or aided over 1,100 Sunday Schools, h.e returned to Philadelphia as assistant secretary of missions. He served in this c.:apacity for several years until he finally beea.m e the general editor of all the literature is- sued br t11e society. The literature of the society in its books, peri· odicals, and other publications has felt the im- press of Dr. Rice's guidance for a full generation. He has been a diligent writer and compiler of books, besi'des being the editor of the Sunday Sch()ol World for many years. In addition to his literary wor1\ he was chair- man of the executive committee at a time when fl.11ances were in a very unsatisfactory condition.

'l'HE CONOORDIENSIS 13 When poets sang, in days of yore, We often .see it stated, rro some illustriOUS •COnquer-or, Their O'des were dedicated. I have a right then in th-ese times, When progress reigns, God bless her, To sing, in ragged reckless rhymes, To a beloved professor. You're not the largest man on earth, Nor do I love by weight, sir, I lil\:e your noble soul, your worth, Your mind and talent great, sir. I like your skillful reasoning powers, And fine imagination; For these, with judgment suc'h as yours, would grace the highest station. I like you for your langaage pyre, Your diagrams explicit, You make your ineaning too so s .. u·r, The veriest fool can't miss it. I like your manly gentleness, Your witticisms merry, Your energetic earnestness, Your tinge of mi 1i tary. Nor qualities alone I see, I like your sunnY smile, sir, When, spite of class formality, You act yourself, the wl1ile, sir. I like you for your heart so true, Your glance and lip expressive, Your well-arranged \Mechanics·· too; Rut that would be ·digressive. 1 like you, that told impudenc~ You dare to lay the lash on, And, lilre a man of sterling sense, I . .ook down on foolish fashion. I like you for your charity, 1 like you, that to you ~s given, Perhaps by inspiration., To hear the harmony of heaven, Attuned at the creation. When morning stars together sang To see earth roll along, And heaven's hig'h vaults with echoes r~ng, As angels caught the song. And then aga.in I like in you, Tb ose very speaking eyes, sir; Grown \deeply beautifully blue,\ From thinking of the skies, sir. And all who 've seen your. \Optics say With beauty they are fraught, sir; Full of light and clear as day, And eloquent with thought, sir. You breathe life throttgh· the ghastly pile Of mouldy mathematics; You kindle interest by your .style, In \Statics\ and \Dynamics.\ You take the student by the hand, And spite of predelections, He feels he treads a ·charmed land, While conning \Conic Sections.\ I like in you that taste refined For 'horticultural pleasures, For it bespeaks a health·Y mind Ann body, pricel~ss treasures. I like you, that whe-n asked for aid. You do not pause and waver And seem suspiciously afraid To do a friend a favor. But daY departs, the red light flow:::; Aslant the sheet l'n1 writing, And round your name more radiance throws Than the pool soul inditing. All virtues shine transcendently In you, Professor Jackson, And each of them I finally 1\!Inst be~ to put the ''max\ on. *After the death of Mr .• Tackson, these verses were found among bis papers. T'he author is un- known. You never fail to show, sir, When students, from anxiety, Blunder in what they know, sir. \ SKE-DADDLE TO HAMIL TON.\ t \ \ I . \ \ \ I! I> t i ' 1 ' -' ~ ;. i \ . l;

Though a victory had ·been looked for, still the students, w:hile not satisfied, were not disap- pointed at the result, for the team, individually and as a whole, put u;p a 1fine game; a game whi.ch has been unsurpassed, save by the game with Rochester. Over two hundred \studes\ and alumni accoin· panied the team to Clinton, leaving Schenectar1y at 10 o'clock and arriving in Clinton about !i o'.clock. It was unfortunate that some kind of conveyance was not on hand in Clinton to carry the team to the college grounds, consequently the team was compelled to walk about a mile, u:p a very steep hill, to fhe !Campus. Whether this :nade any difference in the result of the game is entirely conjectural. The sbowin~ made by the student body was very gratifying, as Union both outnumbered and outc\heered ,Hamilton. It happened that many of the songs were sung to the same \rags Union cl.uplicating many of Hamilton's tunes, and hsv- ing several left over. The game was well played on each side, and the honors were about even, Union outplaying Hamilton in the first !half, and Hamilton having a slight advantage in the second. For Hamilton, Harper was easily the star, making all their big gains on his end runs and skin tackle plays. It seemed almost impossible to down :hi:n. .H!llf a dozen times he broke througn the line clear, and would have srcored had it not rbeen for Shutler, who invariably brought him down. Drummoud also played a strong game. For Union, .Captain Hequembourg and Shutler gained t'he most ground, \Beckie\ doing well on his end runs, and Shutler recovering a great deal of ground on re- ceiving punts. Irish did very good work as left end, handling two forward passes successfully and doing well on. the defensive. On the line, O'Connell played the best game. ·The outcome of the game would doubtless have been different had it not been for t'he splendid punting of \Bumble\ Brown. To the punting and the running-back of vunts most of Union's gains were due. The Game in Detail. .T:he game opened at 4 o' dock, with trnion de- fending the south goal, Hamilton the north. Ham- ilton kicked off to Irish, who made a perfect catch, and covered fifteen yards before being tackled. \Beckie\ then went through for five yards. Riley, ho·wever, was unable to gain; so Brown was drawn back for a punt. The I-Iamilton n1an misjudged the kick and O'Connell tackled bim with no gain. ·Harper then started his phe- nomena~ runs by tearing off twenty yards aro:.1n'l end, being tackled by Shutler. A punt was then attempted, but .Sellnow rbroke through and block· ed it with a loss of five yards. A trick -play netted Ha~JJi1ton ten yards. Drummond tried a place kick, which failed to pass .between fhe ]:osts. This gave Union the baH at the twen~r­ flve-yard line. Downs were made on gains by .Riley, Hequen1bourg and Micks. After two f?..ll ures to gain, Brown punted to McGovern at Ham- ilton's thirty-five-yard line. He returned th~ ba11 twenty yards before Shutler tackled him. On the first down, Hamilton was penalized for hold- ing; Miller. Sidle was then sent through center, but O'·Connell downed him with no gain. Rat.h(->1\ t~1an lose the baH on downs, Drum:nond punted to Shutler, who carried the ball barck thirty yards. The next play was bungled, but Union managed to keep possession of the ball. From the thirty- 'Y' ard line, Brown tried a place kick unsut:DElSS· fully, thus giving Hamilton the ball at the twen- ty-five yard line. Harper and Knox then tor0 off

•J j, ':'l '·, . i 0 THE OONCORDIENSIS gains of ten yards each, around the ends. The next play was broken up by Brown. Again Drum- mond punted to Shutler, who recovererl ten yards. Union ~being unable to gain, ''Bum.ble'' punt~d. Ham:ilton then attempted to put a play through 0'Con:nel, but failed to gain. MeGovern furnblecl the ball on the next play, and Sennow dropped on it. After a gain ·by \Heckie Shutler made a forward pass to Irish, which netted ten yards. A long forward pass, .Shutler to Micks, failed to \make good,\ a ·Hamilton man getting the ball. Harper then gained fifteen yards around end, which Knox followed up with ten more, losing the ball, however, when downed by Shutler. On a fake onside kick Knox was tackled by Irish with. no gain. Trapp and O'Connell broken up the n~xt play. Knox then carried the ball a,cross the field on an end run which failed to net any gain. After Drummond had punted, Union tried a trick for- V.Tard pass, ;Shutler to 'Brown. 'The throw we11t wide, however, imposing a ;penalty of fifteen yards. Brown then punted to Knox, who was tackled by Irisll' after a short run. tHamilton made a rn.~ss <>f the next play losing about ten yards. Irisil re- ·covered the ball for Union by intercepting a for- ward pass. ·The half t!hen ended, with the ball :in Union's possession at the middle of the fie~d. !During the intermission the Union students were content to remain seated, while the IIa~u.:J t.on \rooters\ paraded and formed a block H. In the second half, Hamilton lined up the same as before. For Union, Miller was replaced by Dunbar, Brown was shifted to fullback in Micks' Peter,s. At this po~nt of the game, Dewey was substitued for Riley, Shutler got the ball on a forward pass, .and covered fifteen yards before he \Vas tackled. \Heck:Le\ then gained five yards on a line buck. Brown ;punted to Hamilton, wlw, in turn, lo·st tfie ball through inability to make aowns. This brougnt the ball to the middile or the fleJ.d. Captain Heque1nbourg went thro\Ug·h t:t:e line for eight yards, and Brown got thre9 more thus m:akh1g downs. Dewey on a delaypd pass, and .Shutler on an end run, made sUght gains. Brown then tried a punt, which W::J.s blocked, a Hamilton player falling upon thP ba11. A forward pass was attempted, but Brown P.au.~ht the 'ball. Union succeeded in gaining Rix yards on a forward pass, \ to Irish. Anderson took the place ef Irish, who had been slightly in- jured. Brown ti1en sent a long punt down tte field. T1he Hamilton runner missed it, but ·nan- aged to drop up·on the ball. This brought t~H~ ball so close to Hamilton's goal that it was fonn(l expedient to kick. Shutler covered the punt and brought the ball back about fifteen yards. \Heckie\ made eight yards around Hamilton's right end. After gains by Brown and Dewey, Shutler trie1 a place kick, which went a few feet to the rigtt of tile posts. With the ball on the twenty-five- yard line, HarpeF gained five yards through r8n- ter. Shutler got the ball on Drummond's punt. Union was _penalized fifteen yards upon Ander- son's failure to catch a forward pa~s. Brow ... n punted back to Hamilton, O'Connell nailing the runner upon Union's forty-yard line. After a place, and Sellnow went from right guard to right fifteen yards' penalty on a forward pass, Harper tackle, Griffin being sent in as guard. carried the ball through tackle for a distance of Brown kicked to Harper, who made a good rtin. Hamilton gained on a long forward pass. Failing to gain through 'center, Harper carried the hall through tackle for a long run, which brought the hall to Union's fifteen-yard line. Hamilton ~gain failed to get through center. Union recovered the ball, when I-Iamilton failed to make a forward forty yards, thus bringing it to Union's ten-yard line. A slight gain was made around Union's iefl end. Harper then hurdled the line, and g~ined several yards, until ta,ckled by Shutler. For hurdling Hamilton was penalized fifteen yards. Tile failure of a forward pass gave Union the ball. It had already 1 he·come dark, and the lights of ths pass good. Brown immediately punted to Harner automobiles on the side lines, at the southern end A.tkin was sent in at right guard to replace Or~f~ of the field bothered the Union players consider- fin. Hamilton then gained about twenty yarc!s ably, although t:hey did not at all hinder the on runs ·by Knox and Harper, and a pass to Hamilton men, who faced tile opposit~ direction. ur ne ilt in rE B F G I l

A l::l.rge number of last year's squad will be in the game £tnd there are several men in 1913 who have bad good basketball training. Th Bre ~re some good men in the Albany depa~- ments and an effort will be made to bring them out.

'~E'TH·I·C,S lN A'rvi:ER I CAN On another pag·e will be found a copy of \Ethics in American PubUc Life,\ whjch was written iPU:B1LIC LI:FE.\ by Mould, '09, and which won first prize in fhe Blotchford Ora- tori:eal Contest last June. 'The early part of this month there was publis:h- ed .a book entitled \Representative College Ora- tions\ and whi·ch ·Contains sixty -three orations that have been delivered at different colleges in tile country for some years past. It is the first book that has attempted to put together the be~t orations that have .been delivered in our colleges and great care has been taken in the publication of this book to secure those orations that are really representative of w.hat the college men are thinking and writing a·bout important subjects. It can readily be seen fro1n the fa,ct that from about seven hundred colleges in the United .States only sixty-three orations have been c:hosen and these covering a period of several years, that they are of excellent quality. It is especially gratify- ing- to us that the oration of a lJnion man has ])een selected for this collection. Even though the general atmosp.here about the college may be tba t of an engineering institution where not much time is generally given to such matters as oratory and t!he study of public problems, yet we D.ere are able to secure as deep and broad an education along real broad lines as in most institutions of our land. The men with whom we associate in ~ 01.:11 classes are n1en of broad cali:bre and well ca1)able of directing our attention and interests toward matters that possess a tremendous anount of importance to us in later life. For tba t is where the real strength of a college lies, not so 1nuch in the text books that are used but in the worth of the men who condu·ct the classes and guide the direction of thouglht and investiga- tion. And every time that a man is graduated from her who has received such an education, the name and fame of \Old Union\ are strengthened. This book is well worth reading. It is pu'blished by 'The Macmillan Company, 66 Fifth Avenue, New York, and the pri,ce is $1.215 net.

THE OONCORDIENSIS 9 The annual struggle ibetwP.en the Buff and Blue and the THE HAMilL TON Garnet is a t:hing of the past G·A·M E. for this year. It was perhaps t:he most interesting game to watch- that the tearn has played this season for it was full of exciting plays fro:m start to finish. The two teams were very equally matched, each team seeming at times to have the advantage and then loosi-ng it. From the first the 'Outcome of the game could not be told and this ke.pt up the interest in the contest. The team played hard all of the time and each man deserves much praise. The way in which the students supported the team by their pres- f'nce was especially pleasing. The nulrl.ber of Union men present easily outnumbered the Ham- ilton men and the cheering and singing were both far better. When such support is given fhe tea:n they are able to play with all the strength· in them. Next Saturday occurs the last ga1ne of the season, that -with N. THE N. Y. U. Y. U. at New York. It will per- GAM E. haps be the hardest game of the season, for the N. Y. U. tea1n is es.pecially strong this year, but we hope to he able to mg,ke an excellent showing ]n this game. We are sure that every man on the T.he ,basket .ball schedule for this season will he found else- BASKETBA·LL .. where in the paper. Heretofore the basketball tea:m. has not been very successful but the prospects are especially good this year. The schedule is a good one and the home games are to be played in the Armory, which will insure a good attend- ance. The s-quad will soon be practicing and every man in college who ean play basketball at all should come out at once so as to give the te~m every chance to become .as strong as possible. DRAMATIC ·CLUB. The DramaUc Club has sent for some good plays and as soon as these arrive the best will be chosen for presentation.. The rehearsals begin after Thanksgiving vacation and anyone with ability is invited to attend them. This club ic; making a good start and asks for the support of every loyal Union man. M'eetings are held every Tuesday evening. PRESS CLUB. The Press Club continues to do its silent but effective work. At its last meeting the sale of team will do his best to secure a victory for Union Union calendar was found to ·be insufficient and and the team may feel that the student body is everyone is urged to help increase the number behind them to a man. Coming so soon after the trip to Clinton it cannot be expected that many students will be able to go with the team but all those should go who ·can possibly do so. There will be a large number of th~ alumni present at the game and the more students tilat go the larger will be the crowd to root for Old Union. sold. Plans were made for the Hamilton game and committees were appointed for the making and selling of paper hats and the selling of arm- ' bands and megaphones. Pictures of this game may be obtained in postal form from fress Club members.

He is now a member of the Public Service Com- mission and is in other ways of great political prominence. ·He is the recognized leader of the conservative branch of the Democratic party, and is one of the most probable candidates for Gov- Brnor at the ·coming State election. The Christian Association has gone to a great deal of trouble in ~ecuring 1Mr. Osborne, and it is ho:ped that the meeting will be t:he largest of the year.

< ,):. i' . i . ''jl 12 THE CONOORDIEN:SIS ETHICS IN AM·ERI~C,AN PUBLIC LIFE. Ethics in American pu'bHc life! Principles of morality in business, law, public service, pOlitics! A dream! Oil, U is a good subject for an a·cademic discussion, or a discourse from the pulpit or le·c- ture platform. But it does not get much farther. Public life in this country wants practi-cal men who can get there on the policy of 'Eve·ry man for himself.\ In fact, precepts of morality are chiefly conspicuous in our public life for their want of ap- plication. There is no time or place for ethical consider~tions where great proplems whic:h affect deeply the interests of individuals and nation are pressing for solution. So the men of affairs tell us. But we do not agree. It is an easy matter for pessimists to gather statistics which, if super.ficially considered, are dj scour aging. Instance after instance ~can be found of the prostitution of representative power to selfish advantage. ,Widened opportunities for the play of selfishness and the increase of temp- tations which follow in the wake of our complex life give rise to an appalling number of public wrongs, whose many victims voice an undying ]Jrotest against corruption and an appeal to ~Chris­ tian statesmanship. T:here are extremes of avar- j ce and corrupt and unfair dealings giving rise to unwholesome spectacles of exploitation and in- fidelity to trust. Gambling parades in business pbasize the increasing intensity of the desire to find remedies, the' earnestness with which all forms of evil and oppression are attacked. We 1nust not fail to note the vital regard of the peo- ple for virtue and sobriety. We lnust judge ethi- cal conditions ·by what the people condemn and re.fuse to tolerate in concrete cases. We must emphasize efforts for reform., and the on ward march of the people toward the realization of idea~s for self-government. We ought not and we do not wish to blink any evil or gloss over any wrong. Our public life is far from perfect. But there is no occasion for misgiving. Pessimism and cycicism will not right the wrong or develop the country. The most sig- nificant teaching of our nation's history is G1at whatever has be·2n pennanent and abiding has been foun..ded ultimately in ethics. This inspires a just con:fidence,-a ·Confidence which ignores no wrong, but accepts honestly the present condi- tions, a confidence inspired by visions of the for- ces of right,· that there will be no rest until every vestige of s.pecial favor shall 'have perished and our government in reality becomes demo- cratic. ·T~1 .. 2 American people will not rest until honesty and square dealings are dominant, until ethical eonsideraeons fonn the basis of every act in public life. Progress will be slow, ·but it will be livery, and dishonest and corrupt practices bar ~teady and certain. The moral development of honest rivals from equal opportunities and fhrust l'Ublic life will keep pace with, never precede, the them out of the way or destroy ther.ii. .rustice is subverted and the la.w employed to shield t'he guilty who exploit the rights of the people in the 1noral development of the members of the body politic. Therefore attention must be paid to the heightening of moral sentiment among the people, interests of the few. Public offices have been from whom must be drawn the men who shall ·con_ n1ade agencies for swelling bank accounts.

Government is employed to prompt seHish interests at the ex- pense of the members of th·e community. ·Truly the pessimists can draw for us a depressing pic- ture. Yet we should form a ver:v inaccurate judgrr1ent of moral conditions in public life by considering in morals and more of it. It is the business of the church to spread ethical ideas. The church must he alive to present conditions and continually point the way through a multitude of conflicting tendencies to the right. On our schools and col- leges rests the stability of the nation. So long as they are filled we need entertain no grave appre- hension. Widened opportunities for learning and these wrongs alone. We must not omit to en1- for the spread of intelligence make for better Iiv-

ing and higher standard of conduct. There is need in our day that the schools pay greater attention to education in ethics. We have institutions where young men are trained for public life, and various solutions presented for the complex problems of public life. We 1nust insist that these institu- tions teach that ethical considerations lie at the bottom of ar such pro!blems, and that they shall apply ethics in the solutions they present for con- crete cases. We must insist that the press and other agencies for the dissemination of informa- tion shall stop all a.ppeals to passion, and use the means at their co1nmand to acqua:int the peo- ple with the demands of reason. T:he cry \Every man for himself\ is out of date. The demand now is ''Every man for the people.\ Only as this is heeded in the business of the na- tion can we hope to put an end to unfair practices, unjustifiable preferences, and op:presive dealings. Only when the demands of ethics are obeyed C2vn the nation hope for a prosperity that will be stable and a biding. ·The legal profession is often sharply condemned for the lack of ethical principles in the platfonns of its members. For a young man to enter this profession indicates to many a self-seeking and uns-crupulous character. But lawyers of upright- ness and integrity are more numerous than :1eTe- tofore. There is, perhaps, no profession which in our day offers so great opportunities for disin- terested service as law, and none in which the 1.3 inflexi'ble purpose and fidelity to conscience who without reserve devote their talents to the serv- ice of the people. But we have no patience with those reckless and selfish agitators who seek to make discon- tent serve self-interest, who seek to create class hatred, who distort the good a:ad exaggerate the Evil. There are some who, under the guise of conservatism, seek to protect those who have be- trayed the public interest, and to block efforts for re·medial action. There are others who think, or rather without thinking, assume that any course at all is better than what we now have, and there- fore are continually make passionate ap;peals for change, careless of the interests that would be sacrHiced by the measures they inconsiderately r~ropose or defend. The nation will not tolerate either. The people call for fair play. Great questions of public life, such as tariff leg- islation, restriction of immigration, ~regulation of industry, and control of corporations, and the like, can be solved by thorough study of facts, and founded upon eternal principles of right. In public &ervice the people demand and must have a larger voice in the selection of candidates for office, and a recognition on the part of those chosen of their re,presentative responsibility. There are too many posing as the people's choice who are in reality agents for particular business interests or factota of political bosses. They will qui-ckly pass from the notoriety they temporarily people will so much appreciate men of moral achieve.

After singing the freshm~en ca:me down fro1n the gallery and whUe doing so the .students sangs the Hamilton son?;s, \Pony Bay\ and \We Began to ~score Just a Little 1 Bit.\ Then President Cavert called t'he meeting to order and Potter led a long cheer for the team. Potter also called for the siren for \Reeky.\ ·Cap- tain Hequembourg not being present, number one was given for Veeder, who gave the fellows a short talk. He told t11e students they probably couldn't be satisfied with the result of the Hamilton game, but mentioned that the long trip together with the climb up fhe hill at Hamilton probably had something to do with the outcmne. He said he believed that had the game been played here the result might have been different. But the team felt that the fellows were beb:ind them all the time and it was very encouraging. He urged the fellows to keep up the spirit and to stay bacR of the team during the 'Coming week in order that they may be prepared for tte hardest game which is with :.\1\. Y. U. Sa tnrday. Basketball ·Captain •Charest asked the fellows who intended to try out for basketball to come out at once in order to get in some good :hard training before Thanksgiving. Charest also mentioned that arrangements should be made immediately for the purchase or the winter ciass hats. President Cavert made the announcement of the last meeting in Silliman Hall upon the sPries of talks on the \College Man in Different Phases of Life.\ He told the fellows to ·be sure to turn out in large numbers as the meeting is to be con- ducted by Mr. Osborne of Auburn, ~N.
