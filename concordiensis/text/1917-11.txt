Scrubs to Rest Shoulder- From Ocean to Ocean It Goes. Lineup Unchanged. The Union squad put in their final licks today for the game on Saturday with Springfield Y. M. C. A. This team held the strong Dartmouth aggregation to a score of 14-0 and are reputed to be not only heavy but also very fast, with an exceptionally well devel- oped aerial attack. The Garnet varsity has planned its work du·ring the past few days so as to secure-· an adequate de- fense against these plays and ~lso to get its offense up to the high- est pitch of efficiency. Captain Moynihan has been ta~c- . ing care of his shoulder and w11l probably be able to start the game. I11 the scrimniages he has had or- ders to spare himself whenever possible and for the time b_e~ng has deserted his regular pos1t1on in practice, working out as quar- ter on the scrubs. MacMaster has been shifted to halfback and has shown up well as a shifty runner on end plays and one who1,11 the opposition had difficulty in stopping; With the season so weB a-dvanced, however, it is doubtful wh.ether he will be used in any other position than as quarter in any game. The probable lineup of the back- field at the start of Saturday's contest is \Vi ttner, (luarter; Jones and Moynihan, halfb~ck_s, wi~h r-rravis at full.

He has been getting good distance in his punt- ing and has had more than aver- age luck with his attempts at field goals. (Continued on page 4) CALENDAR. Tonight. '( :15-Mandolin Club- Silliman Hall.

He is not disloyal to the country, but he is living in the past-a year or two years ago when college life was \mer.ry as a marriage bell.\ He needs to be awakened, not hanged for a traitor. Two years ago coli ege life was an affair of convivialities inter- rupted from twenty to forty hours a week by the distressing demands of the faculty. For the morning there were classes, tennis filled the afternoons, the theatre and Glenn's the nig-hts. The,re still are classes, hut mili- tary drill claims the afternoons ami the students have not the price for the theatre and Glenn's, or at least they should not have if they do their duty towards Liberty peace comes. So when that bless- ed day does d·awn we may expect the populations of the two conti- nents to transfer themselves, one to the land of the other, pausing perhaps, as the ships bearing them meet in mid-ocean, to wish one an- other God-speed and success in their new field.

Champions of these \institutions such as the Freshman Peerade and the Sophomore Soiree, have ap- peared as if by magic. And they have been numerous. Some have, :perhaps, been victims of an over- uose of \business-as-usual.\ That doctrine has been known to have i 11 e'tfects as well as good. \\' c are all o-f us here at Union j calous guardians of her customs and her traditions. We realize that it is these that have kept our Alma Mater youthful through the years. But some of us mistake the spirit of the aggregate of these thii;gs. In striving for the preser- vation of a few of the superficial customs, we lose sight of the big- ger and deepe·r traditions. Now, if ever a tradition stood forth from the pages of Union history it has Leen patriotism. In America's time of need our college has ever been ready to do her part. And this is the finer, nobler tradition that the existence of the Peerade and Soiree \customs had they been allowed to continue this yea·r. would have obscured. · •7l. So let us preserve the traditions of Union, especially that very lofty one, her patriotism. We have not so far been fully consist~ ent in maintaining it. We did not do our full share in the Liberty Bond campaign, and we have re- sponded even 'ess willingly to the appeal of the Army \Y\ for funds. It would seeni that there are just two classes of students who should subscribe to this fund- those who intend soon to be serv- ing their country in the field, for they will be directly benefited, and those who cannot do active duty, for they must look for other ways in which to be useful besides fight- ing-. Doubtless if all the individ- uals of both of these classes sub- scribed, there would be more men who could say that they bought both a Liberty Bond and comfort · \,Y hat can I do?\ The charter requires that, '' Eq_ ual Pri v- ileges of admission and instruction, with all the advantages of the Institution, shall be allowed to Students of everv denomination f Ch ·. .

(Continued from page 1 ) machine-gun fire as the Union line, their determination at· the zenith, steadily advanced for their third touchdown. Although the Garnet men suf- fered from fumbling during the f1rst half, they also benefited by a ~;imilar fault of their adversaries, but in the second half their hold on the ball was sure. The work of the line in break- ing through prevented the R. P. 1. backs from getting started. The wings broke up many end runs. On the offense the line opened vvide holes and the interference on wide plays was vastly better than any shown previous to this time. For E. P. I. Lawes was the in- dividual star, breaking.through the Garnet for the most consistent gains of the day. Sweet's punting was of great value to the Cherry- and- \Nhite defense.

Jones bucked the line twice for 3-yard gains and then Han ley punted to Norton on R. P. I.'s 20-yard line.

It is in- teresting, in view of the great im- portance of the game, as everyone recog-nizes that on it hangs the question of the season's success or failure, to see just what the Gar- net has accomplished so far this year.
