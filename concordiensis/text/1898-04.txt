Next year we shall begin to reap the benefits of the Hitchcock bequest. The amount of the bequest is 11pwards of thirty thoasand dollars, and the income i:s to be devoted to the ptn~chase , of new books,, and to the care of the books already on the library shelves. The bequest was not intended to provide for tbe administra- tion of the library, but simply .to add new books and to keep the ones that are there in proper d 't' con 1 ton, It is obvious that this tnoney c9uld not have been devoted ~to a better purpose,, nor could it have been devoted to any purpose where it would produce more considerable or more sub- stantial results. We have every reason to feel grateful for the recent progress ef the library, both in equipment and administration, and hereafter, we shall have reason t() feel grateful every day to the Rev.' Oscar Blakeslee Hitch- cock, a loyai son of Union, who, to quote his own words, made this bequest to his ''dear Alma Mater.\ May others be as loyal as he. May we, even now, day by day, do our little for Union college, in the same spir,it in which he made this noble gift. Certainly no one has given more welcome help where help was needed than Mr. Hitch cock. A brief recital of the facts of M,r. Hitchcock's life, will be of interest to the readers of The Concordiensis. He was born May 24th, 1828, at Windham (now Ashland), N. Y., and was descended fron1 old Connecticut stock. His school days up to his fifteenth year, wer-e spent in a district school. He then attended Delhi academy, Ulster Co., N.Y., for two years. The academy broke up on account of anti-rent tr()ubles and he removed, first to Wilbraham, Mass., then to America, Dutchess Co., N., Y. He entered Union college in 1850 and was: graduated in i8~z, receiving an election to the Phi Beta Kappa society. The Hon. David Murray, his classmate and room-mate, speaks of him as a student not very assiduous \ in the sense of grinding out a daily grist of hard work,\ but of a bright mind, a zealous and appreciative reader of books, of marked literary ability and ''a poet f . ,, o no mean powers. After graduation from college, he studied theology for a year at the New Haven Divinity school. He then studied for a year at the Poughkeepsie Law school, returning to New Haven the succeeding year. He was graduated in theology at Andover in r856. His first ministerial charge was at White River Junction, Vt. Failure of health com- peHed him to relinquish this charge. Upon his recovery, he preached at Ashland, N. Y., until 18.59 and then at Whitney's Point, N. Y., until 186o. His health failing him again, he gave up his charge. He remained at hotne until the outbreak of the Civil War. During the war Mr. Hitchcock rendered effi- cient hefp, not only by his public ac~voc~cy of the Union cause, but by actual servtce 1n t~e Union hospitals in the south, bot~ as chaplmn and in other capacities. He was 1n Charleston on the fourth anniversary of the surrender of Fort Sumter, when Gen. Anderson t·estored the flag he had struck in '6r. From the close of the war until the time of his death, Mr. Hitchcock was virtually in retire- ment, his health not permitting of an active life. He travelled extensively however, and was furthermore a proficient student of geology. In fact Union college is indebted to him for some valuable geological specimens. . . During his latter years Mr. H1tchcock ltved in Ithaca, N.Y., at the hon1e of Mr. C. H. Van Router, whose wife was his cousin. He died July 7th, I 897, at Shelter Island, whither he had gone to rect·uit his health. In addition to his principal bequest, Mr . Hitchcock also bequeathed his lib1·ary to the college. His loyalty to his Alma Ma~er wa.s of that substantial so:rt which converts 1tself 1nto practices. ..

In 1870 · this average age was 19 years; r 790, 20 years. In 18oo i1t fell to 18. In r81o it fe11 to a trifle . liess than rS. In 1820 it had risen to r8 plus, in 1840 to 19, and in r85o to 19 plus, where it has since· retnained, so far as the records have been consulted. What is most surprising is the high :average for the early p·eriod. Require- . ments for ad1nission to the ieading colleges a century ago were of courses far below what they are now, and it seems to be a fact that most graduates then who later attained great distinction. entered colleges at ages not known now. Thus Webster and Choate entered Dart- ·mouth vvhen less than I 5 years old, and George Ticknor when only a bout I 2 years old. John 'Trutnbull, the poet, passed his examina- tion for Yale when only 7 years old, though he did not enter the college for some time after- ward. He was a prodigy, however, and his period was half a century earlier than that of Ticknor and Choate. Nevertheless, cases of entering college at 12 and 14 yea1·s a century ago could be cited in large number, but the Darhnoutb figures would indicate that they were the exception and not the ru]e. Possibly, how- ever, Dartmouth itself would prove to be an ex- ception among colleges. The sections from which it drew students tnost largely were more remote and less favored than those about Har- vard and Yale, and this tnade a great difference. (;I]~ 'ooperstOUTQ fneet. The athletic meet at Cooperstown, at the close of last term, between a team from the Cooperstown Athletic association and a Union team, was won by Cooperstown. The events were the same as at all previous meets and our men scored 852 points to 992 for Coopers- town.

IN THESE ugly, stormy, blood-shot times, when yellow jou~nals _are shrieking like mad, when even those papers hitherto sane are losing their balance and McKinley stands see.:mingly deser~ed because he has dared to do right, it is a.n inspiring thought to Union men to know that almost the only New York daily that has not for a. moment wavered in its support of McKinley and the Right, is a paper controlled by a Union ma.n. THERE is a time\ worn prejudice against gambl- ing on the incubator that we feel tempted to forget when ~he matter under discussion is this year's . . baseball. During the past week the candidates . . hav:e been out in daily practice and their_progJ,'eSs has. delighted every one. Captain Smith this year will captaiQ a w~nning team. That is, if the ;· students will only, only, do their :share. ''Give your money and lend your presence,\ is the motto at present. A man who won't do this won't fight for his country. His place is amGng the Spaniards. AN official ru.bbel'' for the track team has been put on our ,self-denia.llist for the present, and the only thing for thH men to do is to turn in and do the work themselves. If a student is unable to pay asubscription an honorab~e and manly way for hi 1 m to liquidate his debt is b.y working it out as suggested. They do tltis in many colleges larger and richer than ours, and no one is ever in\ jured by it. The tirack men absolutely need this attention after practice, and i~t's an opportunity to objectify some of this college spir;it you hear so · · much about. THE action of the 'Students Thursday 1uorning, at the special college 1neeting, was true to the best traditions of the co'llege and verily better than the attainment of Jnany first grades. To Mr. Angle, to Mr. Dillingham and to Mr. John W. H. Pollard, for this new infusion of genuine spirit there will be erected a mentodal in the heart of every man on the hill. For the alumni who have shown their love for old Union in the way that talks without talking, not the least of whom is now at the head of this coUege, the students shall never cease to render a full meed of appreciatien. A.T THE tirne of writing there is every reason for anticipating a splendid success for the musical organizations in each of the three concerts to be given this week. Manager Sinclair, aided nobly by the alumni in ·the various places to be visited has done his utmost and is deserving the apprecia- tion of the entire college. A noteworthy fact is that two of the concerts are given under the aus- pices of the preparatory schools in their respective towns. The obvious result of this is the interest- i~g of the parents and friends in the concerts and of the sons in Union college. Th~ attitude of the New York alumni has also been gratifying to a high degree, and through their co-operation the outlook for Saturday's concert in that city can be reckoned nothing short of brillia:at.

IN\ A recent issue of the Hamilton Lite:rary maga~ine is published the full correspondence of a g;tudent of this college who undertook some- thing beyond his authority and who rightfully came to grief. The first letter is apparently a provisional challenge, the second :is apparently a weak,ening of the nerve thttt dictated the first, alild ilhe. third is apparently tearful though seif- defendin~g. We do not blame our brothers. at IlarnUtoB for being indignant at the whole busi- ness. and we can only add that their indignation does not surpass that in our own college. We thank. them for acquitting Union of all blanl!e in the~ matter, and we assure them that such a caper is not likely to be cut by any other member of this community in the near future. Ul~ flr~ 'itiz~QS First. During the chapel service at the opening of the spring tenn, President Raymond, after speaking at some length concerning the interests and work of the college, said that first of all the students of Union college are American citizens and whatever our duties toward the college, shoulld be ready to respond to our country's call w he:a the necessity required our services. It was so the students responded at the outbreak of the Civil War. ''But,\ said he, \as educated men we should not desire war, until all means for an honorable peace have failed; we should favor war only as a last resort.\ :rfeerolo~y.

t., to OQ Baseball. When college opened this spt·ing term and · every baseball enthusiast was ea;ger for th,e · ga.me· to begin on the campus, numerous in- quiries were made for the basebaU schedule. Nobody knew n1uch abo1:1t the ,matter. Mana- ger Holcotnbe was at home in Hartford and had . the entire correspondelil:ce and essential details with him. The Spanish war ta['k bad fired his military spirit, he had joined the Naval Reserves and had received notice not to .. ieave Hartford. So assistant manager Ga:mbee went to Hartford Aprd 7 and returned with the schedule nearly complete. Several dates are not yet fully deter- mined but enongh are fixed to warrant the pub- lication of the following schedule: Union at home: .April 16-CoUege of the City of New York ; 1 8 or 19-Syra:cuse ; 29- University of Vermont. May +-'Colgate ; 7- Hamilton; · 1 1-St. John's Miliitiary academy; 18-Hobart; 28-St. Lawrence;; 3P-Middle- bury. Unio~ abroad : April 2 3-· West Point at West Point. May 21-Cuban ,ex-Giants, at North .A-dams, Mass. ; zs---HamHton at :Clinton. June 7-· Colgate at Hamilton; 8-· Syracuse at Syracuse ; 9 or Io-Hobart at Geneva. Manager Gambee expects to £11 .several more dates with games in the vicinity of Schenectady. The baseball outlook for this ·season is very bright. The crowd of rooters out every after- noon watching the practice is critical and the 25 or 30 men trying for positions are doing ex- cellent work. Every one is not a star but all are doing hard work. The advisory board has appointed assistant manager Gambee as manager to succeed ,mana- ger Holcotnbe and he is working hard to com ·plete the details of a successful campaign on the diatnond. At the first coUege meeting of the , term Monday n1orning a committee of five was :' appointed, consisting of three from the seniors and one fro,m each of the lower classes, to select an assistant manager from the sophomore class to fill the vacancy caused by manager Gambee's promotion.

At the . last meeting of the fa,culty it was supposed that : the tnatter would be acted upon, as there are . three .men in d1e senior class who are members , .of the state militia, W. C. Yates, D. J. Hutton, : and c:. E. Parsons. No officiail action, how- :. ever, was taken, but Dean Ripton has said that . beyond all doubt, diplomas would be granted to the three seniors in case they were called into acH ve service before June . R. S. Hoxie, 'g8, and A. D.

The base:@aU season of 1898 was most auspi.ci- ously opened on the ca.mpus last Saturday after- noon when Union crossed bats with the tea~m representing, the College of the 'City of New Y:ork. The ca1npus was never in better condition, Saturday's sun having dried the ground from the effects of the previous day's rain. The per- fect weather~ the crowd, among them so many of the fair sex:, and the enthusiasm of the students, together wit \h the fine work of the team, com- bined to rna1ke the opening game one not soon to be forgotten. The hard work that the candi- dates for tile team have been doing for the past \ two month~s. was much in evidence in the play- ing of Captain Smith's ''colts'' in Saturday's game. Such~ a bright prospect for '98 in a team, six of whom are underclassmen means a still brighter ot~tlook for '99 with the loss of but one man and already several candidates for the place left vacant ay him nex:t year. The sho-wing made by the new men on the team was beyond the fondest expectations. Mallery pitched like a veteran, New York get- Hog only .five hits in nine innings. His throw- ing to bases was accurate and his batting strong. The other features were the work of Cook at short stop and the fielding and batting of Wiley. The work tOf the team was uniformly good and the game, to quote an old baseball crank, '~Was the best played first game ['ve ever seen on the campus.\ It was Sb01tly afterthree o'clock when Umpire Enders started play. As last year, French was the first rna:n up and he led off with a two- bagger to right field.

Un1pire, Mr. Enders. The' first concert of the trip was given at Saugerties last Thursday evening and a large and eNthusiastic audience greeted the clubs. This concert was held at the Maxwell Opera house under the auspices of Saugerties High school. All the clubs were received with the usual rounds of applause, nearly every selection being ,encored. It had been intended to give a dance after the concert but rain prevented. The club went from Saugerties to Newburgh, where they stopped at the '' Palatine.\ Several mem- bers of the club were entertained by Prof. Trask of the Newburgh High school, and the City Club house was thrown open to the entire asso- ciation. The concert on Friday evening was a decided success both for the clubs and for the athletic association of the Newburgh High school under whose auspices the concert was given. 'l,he next morning the clubs arrived at New York where they put up at the Murray Hill. The concert was given at Carnegie ball, which is very well fitted acoustically for a concert of this kind. The hall was corpfortably filled with a loyal and enthusiastic audience, the farne of last year's concert having pteceded the ah·ival of the clubs. Every tnember was greeted with great applause. One of the special features of this concert was the Cuban $Ong written by Hastings, '75, with a score written by Abe Lansing of Albany. Mr. Lansing acted as accon1 panist on the trip owing to the illness of Heerrnance, 190r. 1\'he Sun, in writing of the New York eoncert said : \The undergraduates of lln1on college gave a rare treat to friends of the college \\\vho like 1nusic, last night in the Carnegie Chamber Music hall. The purpose of the concert was to raise funds for the alumni association ; and it was under the patronage of many well known women, among tbetn Mrs. Daniel Butterfield, Mrs. General Horace Porter, Mrs. E. H. Kennedy, Mrs. Clark Brooks, Mrs. Daniel S. Lamont, Mrs. Frederick W. Seward, Mrs. Robert C. Alexander, Mrs. Andrew H. Stnitb. and Mrs. Edgar S. Barney. The glee club was led by Frank MacMahon and it sang with marked success. The instrutnentals were students who were adepts with the mandolin., guitar and banjo and were encored after each ...

The very fact that we were obvious1y outclassed, caused our costly errors and the consequent score. Now we have material, .good and plenty of it. What we must have, and right away, is a coach that will ginger up the men and teach them that victory comes sweetest froin prospective defeat.. T-here i:; not a n1an on the tea1n that wouldn't break his neck trying to win a ga1ne foi' the Garnet. A good coach would teach him how to put the purpose, at lea~t, into action.

The latter team had just returned from a success- ful southern trip and Monday's gan1e was the ninth one of the season for them. This fact certa,inly had much to do with the result, but the playing of the wearers of the garnet was very ragged ia the field and the ten errors were all costly ones. The features of the game were the home run by Vorhees and the batting streak developed by Union in the ninth inning, one single and three two-baggers being credited in the score book. Union started off in the first inning with French and Robinson out at first on easy hits to Costello and after Delehanty had singled, Thatcher followed the example of the first two. In the second half of the inning Syracuse started in with a rush, Lipes and Manley going to first on four bails, and the former scoring on a passed ball. Vorhees and Kelly struck out, but a two base hit by Mitchell scored Manley, and Mitchell scored on another passed ball. Cos- tello ended the inning with a strike out. The home team scored in the second inning, the fourth, and the ninth. In the second Wiley went to third on a fly to right field over the terrace, and Mallery brought him in on a single to Manley. In the fourth, Vroom an singled and made second on a passed ball, and on another single by Mallery, scored. The real hitting, however, did not come until the ninth inning. Cook led off with a two-bagger to left field and French followed with exactly the same play, which brought Cook home. French came . romping in on Robinson's single, Delehanty took three strikes, but beat out Gregory's throw to first. Thatcher sent the sphere spin- ning off to right field and amid a confusion of vdld throws and errors, all three men scored. Here, however, it all ended. Smith and Vroo- man could not get to first and Wiley went out on a foul to the catcher. In the meantime Syra- cuse had been piling up the runs on an average of near[y three pet~ inning so that after the sec- ond inning there wasn't a doubt as to the result.

The Coqc,ordieJl.sis VoL. xxr. UNION {~:OLLEGE, APRIL 30, 1898 .. No. 25. General Henry E. Tremain delivered the twenty-ninth lecture in the Butterfiel<il course, in the coUege chapel, Friday afternoon, April 22, to a large and appreciative audience of students, alumni ··and friends of the coUege. President Raymond introduced Genet~al Dan- iel Butterfield, the founder of the lecture course, who accompanied the le.cturer. The president said it was significant that on this day, when the first shot had been. fired against Spain, Union coUege should be bono red by the presence of two generals of the civil war. After announcing the prizes offered in con- nection with the lectures, General 13'utterfield introduced the speaker, by relating how he had become .acquainted with General 'Tremain, during a sev·e1·e engagement on the battlefield, when Tremain, then a young soldier, had approached him and offered his services. The subject of the lecture was ''A Talk on Money.\ In opening Gen. Tremain said that this was not a talk for money or to money, but to brains anticipating money. Speaking of · private and public finance he said that sBence about one's own affairs was commendable, and that public finance is a dull, unprofitable study, unless its ruditnents are analyzed. Unless we ·are prepared to differentiate the elements of financial success, it is sure to terminate in failure. The element of chance must be eliminated as much as possible, this the speaker regarding as the philosophy of the age. He would not attempt to de:fi.ne money, for its terms depend on the way they are used as well as upon the man who uses them. He said that he would pay little attention to terms and depend upon facts. Francis Bacon was right when he said that you must possess all the facts. They may be hard to get but they remain. The speaker then treated his subJect from a historical point of view, and showed that the history of money and the history of civilization. are intertwined. He said that it is difficult for us to realize the Va 1 lue of wampun1 and sheep, measured by one or ,more articles for which they could be exchanged. To custom was due the use of sheep, cattle and .shekels of gold as mediums of exchange. When gold became a medium, other arHcles fell into disuse, because gold was more convenient to handle. Exchange by this .method was called barter. Barter is the rudiment of comtnet~ce. It was not practiced on the principle of something for nothing. Arti- cles were exchanged for something else of equivalent value. In the absence of any credit the precious metals gave the best means of exchange ; the more precious the metal the more convenient, the more compact the better liked. Metals to be used for money must be current. Uniformity also is necessary. And currency without credit is not money. All depends upon confidence and convertibility into something of value. A currency of coin some- times meets with disaster, and nations have frequently in times past, had to alter their coin- age laws, and impose penalties for counterfeit- ing and mutilating coins. In the reign of Henry VIII., the government stamp was looked uponas the mark of the coins value, and many private individuals found the temptation to counterfeit too alluring. In Venice coins were pared and clipped. Milled and hammered coins, difficult to counterfeit were then made. These soon became current. But the best money went abroad, the bad money remained in circulation, eli pping and counterfeiting went on regardless of laws, and the currency, commerce and agri- culture became deranged. The government began to reject bad money in payment of taxes and misery followed. The speaker said that the high price of gold is only a symptom and not a cause, and quoted Jefferson's statement,

6 THE :OONCORDIENSI,S .. ,, that the ratio of gold to silver is a mercantile ; problem altogether. The speaker held that the . taws of commerce regulate credit between •. nations. .. government,, aad said that if th.e battalion was organized he would ask Genera] 'Tremain to take comm.and. The proposition was ·g~eeted with enthusiastic app[aule. Speaking of paper m~oney, he said that it· ~entails distress and suffering unless it is convert- . able into coin, that credit is based upon uniform · confidence. H~e cited the case of France during· the French revolution, when distress beca,tne · the lot ofthe most thrifty, and confusion reigned, because of our issue of inconvertable paper . money, which steadity decreased in va!lue. He also traced the history of paper money in our. own country, and said that prior to the adoption of the constitut~on political ills were no com- parison to those arising fro1n financial con- ditions. Every !state had tried its own money scheme. There was no reliable source of pub- lic or private ,money. Whiskey and tobacco did service for money in Virginia, and tobacco was made legal tender for everything from taxes to wives shipped from England. There were so many k1nds of money that no merchant could set a price on anything. The paper money craze in Massachusetts and Rhode Island brought about a state of anarchy. They thought the value rested solely in the government stan1p. This state of affairs eventually led up to Shay's rebellion. Discussing the power which money exerted, the speaker said that the control of a loan meant the control of an etnpire, and the control and discharge of a loan meant the con- trol of two empires. Public loans should be in just proportion to the public revenue, but when credit money is a loan, then it is a dangerous resource. Only a tnan of wealth can live without,money. In conclusion, the speaker said that there is always politics in money. And if we wish sound money, we must promote sound politics. GEN. BUTTERFIELD'S OFFER. At the conclusion of the lecture, General Butterfield arose and said that he and his associates in New York city were enrolling volunteers for the war, and when the organi- zation was completed, he would offer their services to the president. He then made the entirely unexpected offer to equip a battalion of Union college students, and call upon the Union alumni to fill out the battalion. He then asked those to rise who were ready to volunteer. About half of all present signified their desire. The General said that preparations need not interfere with our term's work, for he had been told by ex-Secretary Sherman that all the vol- unteers would not be ready for about three months. He hoped that Union college might be among the first to offer her services to the . [Written by W. C.

I The addition of one more name to the number of Union's sons w bo have served their country in the cabinet, :bas sent a thrill of pleasure through us all. Charles Emory Smith, '61, has been appointed Postmaster-General to succeed James A. Gray, resigned. Mr. Smith's career is so well known that it need not be given here, but we might say that l1e is a Regent of the University of the State of New York, and editor of the Philadelphia Press. He was Minister to Russia from 1890 to 1892. ' I· : .. .. ~·.

' I· ;. THE CONCORDIENSIS. 1 U QiOlJ Defeats West polQt With many misgivings as to the propriety of the trip, the baseball team left for West Point last Saturday morning in the midst of a heavy rain storm. Upon arriving at their destination, however, they were much surprised to find the fairest kind of weather and the parade grounds in excel:lent condition. Captain Smith and his followers were riot disappointed, for they bore in mind a long list of defeats in baseball and football for the garnet at the hands of the cadets. Union has never triumphed over the :Cadets on the gridiron :and, not since r894 on the diamond. lt was with a determination to blot out former defeats that the nine began the ga.me. The game was a. pretty struggle from start to finish and every man on Union's team did himself proud. In the individual work Thatcher easily took the lead. Only six hits were tnade off his delivery and that he p1~oved a puzzle to the cadets is shown by the eight men he struck out. He gave no bases on balls, and made five assists. Thatcher was well supported by the team and especially by Parshall behind the bat, whose work even outshone that of the heretofore in- vincible \Del.\ In this game the fellows played together better than in any of the sea- son's contests, the team·work being a marked feature. · In the first inning neither side scored. In the second Union found Craig's curves and before he could pull himself together four men had crossed the plate. Brown succeeded Craig in the third and held Union down to one run. In the next, West Point with some clean hitting sent two men across the rubber and followed in the fifth with two more. Union scored one in the sixth, and the cadets another in the seventh, but in the eighth the wearers of the garnet put an end to any doubt as to the outcotne by scoring three runs. The story of the game in detail is as follows : UNION. A.B. R. 1E. P.O. A.

The matter of most importance in regard to the Musical Clubs this week is the changing of 1nanagers. As all of the long trips have now been made and there are only a few concerts still :to be given and those in neighboring towns, Manager Sinclair yielded his position to his assistant, Mr. Vander Veer. The manager is at present trying to ,make a date for a concert at Cohoes on Tuesday, May 17, and one for Troy, on Friday, May 20. Then it is also his intention to give concerts at Cana- joharie, Ballston, Saratoga or Johnstown before June. It will be easy for the clubs to give these concerts without interfering with the regular coHege work. As is custotnary the final concert of the year will be given at Schenectady. This always closes the season very fittingly as the college shows its appreciation of the clubs' work by the large crowd of students and alumni who attend it. The music is exceptionally good as the pieces are prepared especially for this concert. The final concert will probably take place this year Tuesday, June 21, but the date has not been definitely decided upon.

If the class of '98 be as true to the interests of their alma mater in after years as it bas been in the past four, Union may be congratulated after next June on the accession to her alumni rolls. IN A. private conversation at the White liouse last -week President McKinley said that tbe two ne-wspapers in the United States whose support he valaed most highly and upon which be prilil~ipally relied in the impending crisis, were the Phila- delpllia Press and theN ew York Mail and Jtxpress.

'The graduating class numbered £fty- seven .men, of whom J. A. Barnes, c·. S., Prest, A. H. Traver, C. G. McMuUen, F. I. Jansen and F. M. Johnston, are aU old Union coUege men. Th:e essayist, Emmott Howd, read an able retrospect of ,medicine, and the degrees were conferred by President Raymond. Th.e address of the day was given by Hon. J arnes A. Roberts., State Comptt·oller. ''If the human family be divided into two classes,\ he said '' those who practice ·tnedicine and those who are practiced upon, it is the latter and greater class who shoud.. congratulate themselves on such an occasion as this that their ills and accidents are to receive treattnent by modern methods rather than by those of the past.'' . The speaker then gave a review ofthe history of medicine, and spoke of the necessity of purity and holiness and personal cleanliness, courtesy and kindness in the practice of n1edicine. ''The competition in professional life in our country,\ he continued, \is sharp and intense. The genius of this world is largely work and the man of modern abilities by systetnatic, patient work can attain eminence. \The physician more than any other man or woman in the community, can exercise great influence for good. The possible power which this gives him should be extended for the wel- fare of humanity. It should be a part of his duty to teach healthful wayi of l~ving, to impart a moral precept, to utter a word of warning or of censure. \More than in any other profession-if your calling and election are made sure-must you dedicate yourselves to humanity; tnust you, for the tin1e, forget friend, wife, child, and cling to the stranger, stricken and helpless. Though your profession denies you much of the so-called pleasure, and requires that willing self-sacrifice become a daily duty, you, far mo1·e than any other profession will receive as a reward a •• wealth of personal friendship and eloquent testi- .monials of affectionate gratitude.\ The address was followed by an eloquent . valedictory from Otis Z. Bouton, which com- pleted the evercises of the day. The Theta Sigma sorosis oftheUnion Classical institute gave a very delightful dance at Arcade Hall,. on Thursday evening, April zr. The dance was preceded by an exceptionally well rendered farce, called ''Psyche, M. D.'' A large nutnber from the hill were present and all expressed themselves as well pleased with the young ladies entertainment. The dancing, music for which was furnished by Gioscia, con- tinued until the wee sma' hours. The following students \vere present : Grif- fith, Deyoe, Turner, Foote, Gambee, Hinman, Medbery, F. T. Wright, Hoyt, Lawton MacCulloch, Paige, Palm,er, Nevins, W. E. Merritnan, Bonesteele, Wilson, H. J. Brown, Nellis, Eames, Vrooman, Closs, R. E. Brad- ford, Strong, Sawyer, Vander Veer, Dunham, Kirby~ P. L. Merriman, J. S. Stewart, Pike, Cullen, Lawrence, Featherstonhaugh, Weed, N. G. Medbery, W. C. Yates, Loucks, H. Strong. Track team work is now going on in earnest under the supervision of Captain Price and Mr. Pollard. Every afternoon at four o'clock a number of candidates may be seen at hard work. Cross-country runs are an especial feature. There is now but a short time remaining before the spring meet, and it is necessary for any re- maining 1nen to commence active training at once. A rubber will soon be engaged. Among the candidates are the following: Price, Deyoe, Hild, Sylvester, Kirby, Merritnan, Hartnagel, Davis, Weed, Wright, Turner, Mattice, Vroo- man, Hodgson, Tummonds, Crichton, Closs, French, Gutmann, Hegeman.

. ·l , ,I • I 10 TRE O:ONOORDlE~SlS. The American· Republican College league has issued an official call for a National conven- tion of the leagae to be held in Indianapolis, Ind., May 19-20. All colleges granting .the degree of A. B •. , B. S., LL. B., or any other degree of equal rank are entitled to have their Republican clubs enter the league. The league is divided into ~tbirteen departments, of which the State of New York with its twenty-two eligible colleges and universities constitutes the third department. It is the hope of the officers of the •league that all colleges having duly organized Republican ·clubs will take steps to send delegates to the convention, and that col- leges not having clubs will imm•ediately organize them. A plan is on foot to hold a convention of clubs composing the Third Department at some date prior to the National convention. Mr. J. Roger Lewis of Cornell University, is chairman of the Third Departm·ent, and com- tnunications concerning the league, the depart- ment or matters in general pertaining to organi- zation and delegates may be addressed to him.
