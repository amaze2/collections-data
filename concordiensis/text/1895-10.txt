Th.e \Sons of Old EU\ Run Up a Score ·Of 26 Against Union's Kickers. Union has start~d in a aew foot-ball era. Last Saturday, for the first time in heT history, she rnet the Yale teatn. It is also the first tirne she has ever tnet on the gridiron a team frotn any of the three ~arger colleges. T!1e gatn.e with Yale could not have been more satisfactory, for there was nothing at all unpleasant in it. The Yale team are all gentletnen, and they used the Union tnen as such. And the wearers of the garnet returned the cotnpli1nent. . There vvas not the least kicking, and a ga1ne never went off rnore stn oothly. Captain Thorne bas surely won a place in the hearts of all true Union tnen. \Vhile Union. was beaten she does not consider herself beaten badly, taking in account that this was her· first game of the season. TJIE CROWD. The crowd at the gatne was one of the largest ever seen on the grounds of the Ridgefield Athletic Club. Yale has n1any followers in Albany, but Union has tnore. Besides, it was a foot-ball gatne, and no one can be up to date unless he goes to see a foot-ball gan1e, and especially when Yale plays. From the thne the gates were thrown open to the public until the teams lined up, there was a continuous string of people pouring in, and when the game finally began it is estitnated that 5,ooo were on the ground. The grand Rtand was filled, and several thousands crowded around the side lines on the opposite side of the field. The 1nanagement of the crowd was good, and the field was kept dear of all except players, substitutes and officials. There were many fashionable turnouts along the side lines, and nearly all had either the garnet of Union or the blue of Yale conspicu- · ously waving frotn the1n. Union men were out · in great numbers, and the people knew they . were fron1 Union, for they y1elled long and [oud, . ; as they always do. The Yale yell, too, was . heard frequently; for while not 1nany of the . undergraduates were presen:t, there were lots of Yale tnen there-and YaJe sisters, too. . The grand stand was a tnass of humanity, and . it was sut~ely a pretty sigbt. Nearly all wo1:e · the colots of either Union or Yal'e, and the tnany beautiful and tasty to i[ie.ttes. blending with th~e hand.sotne and cheerful faces of the wearers . certainly fonned an imposing spectacle. Every lover of sport in Albany was there. I'he old thner looked on with anx:ious gaze as the players rushed through the oeBtre and thought how tnuch different the ga11l.ile was when he played. Business and professional tnen forgot their dignity and yelled like :rnad when a good play was made. The young \would-be'' lo~ked with bulging eyes as a tnan would ad- vance the ball and wondered if he would ever be able to play that way. The fair sex was even more excited than the 1nen. Mothers were there who had boys on the teatn, and at every rush thei1r hearts would rise into their throats as they saw sorne one untangle the struggling tnass of humanity. The sister, too, with anxious and excited gaze, watched her brother tnake 'a run vvith the ball or tackle a man, wondering at the ti1ne how he could ever do it uninjured. But it was the svveetheart that looked on with the closest attention, for she could not tell what n1ight b~cotne of her lover as he dove through the crowd vvith the ball or stopped a centre play. Then there was the girl who went to the gatne just because it was the fad. She was there in great abundance, and the white chalk lines meant no n1ore to her than a base-ball diatnond, for she didn't know what they were. She thought the man J.vith the ball was doing all the work, no tnatter whether he ran backvvards or for- wards, and she could not understand why they were always giving such queer numbers. THE TEAMS. It was n few n1inutes before three when the Yale teatn trotted out on the field. They took

Let us this conl- ing year do even better and show the public that we have something at Union besides athletics, and that our musical ()rganizati()ns cannot be beaten by any of the smaller colleges in the country.

One afte1·noon a few days after college opened M·anager Greenman, of the foot-ball tearn, with his usual contplacent and quiet air, stood on the field watching t.he 1nen practice. A stranger carne along, and of course began to talk foot- baH, for that is the only topic discussed on the field. At a, first glance one n1ight have taken the stranger for·a German, a large oily-faced Ge1·man, for his face was red and plump, and shone like a rnirror. To set it off, encircling his chin was one of the . rnost cha1·ming Van Dykes I ever saw, while a blue coat buttoned tight and a yachting cap gave him . an appearance not unlike a sea captain. But that walk ! How can one ever forget it ? It. was a weary walk, not a weariness that con1es from over- . work, but a weariness known as ''that tired feel- ing,\ which tnany inherit. He informed Mr. Green1nan that he was not a Fresbrnan, but that he thought of entering college and would like to try for the team. He was told that he would be given \ all the show in the world,\ and the conversation finally drifted to last year's tean1. It was something as follows: The Psi U's gave the first dance of the season at their house on Friday evening. It was a very informal affair. Among the ladies pres- . ent were Miss Waite of Sandy Hill ; Miss Whitehead of New York ; Miss Caney .of Am- ster.dam ;.

Instead of a tnnsty-smelling store-room, they were greeted with a cheerfu 1 l, well-furnished parlor upon the open door of which were the letters Y. M. C.

Hved un- der difficulties, being obliged to hold irregular and inftieq uent meetings at such. tilnes as the class-roorns were available, and never enjoying that socia[ intercourse of the 1nernbers afforded by the present quarters. This intenningHng of rnen with .con1mon purposes and interests, is of inestitnabte advantage, and tends to develop that manliness so essential to success in the practice of tnedicine. A :stud.ent can tnake no n1ore fatal 1nistake than to devote his time too exclusively to science, and neglect his social and tnoral developrnent, for though he 1nay have infinite professional skHl, yet, without a pleasing personality with which to win the confidence and respect of his associates he will never be able· to build up a large practice. The college develops the phy- sician, the Y. M. C. A. develops the n1an. The present tnetnbership is about 30, thouglr at the fi1~st tneeting that ntnnber will undoubted- ly be doubled.

U ninn's representatives .cn the international · athletic teatn returned to coHege Monday even- · ing, Oct. 7. The students knew of their com- . ing, and intended that the people of the city • should also know of it and of the great wor~ ' that Kilpatrick and Sands have done during the· past sutntn er. With this end in vi:ew, ~1anager Terry etn- : ployed a band, secure.d son1e transparencies, hired a carriage and proceeded to the depot to · await the cotning of the charnpions. 'rhe band . failed to appear, it is true, probably because they w·ere enjoying the conviviality rendered . possible by the dollar paid the.tn to secure the bargain; but they were not sadly missed, for a college procession can furnish its OV\'n music, · and rnusic of much 1nore exhilarating effects. The train arrived, and the expected ones were escorted to the carriage atnid the welcon1ing cheers of the students. Kilpatrick and Sands . occupied the front seat and Manager Terry and Everett Stnith the back, while with the driver· 1·ode an enthusiastic Sophomore carrying a transparency which inforrned the throngs of. people along the streets that Chas. H. Kil- . patrick was World's half-tnile chatnpion and . the holder of the wodd's half-mile record, and that Geo. M. Sands was Metropolitan quarter- mile champion. This conveyance, escorted by an abundant · crowd of urchins and followed by a line of students arranged in the order of classes, made a tour .of the city. Everywhere the streets were lined with crowds .of people glad to welcon1e back in as royal a manner as possible those who · had done so much to spread the fan1e of the college. There were illuminations all along the line o·t march, and in other ways the citizens showed their enthusiastn and interest. The procession marched to the catnpus, where it disbanded. . BETA THETA PI BANQUET. After the procession was ended the cham- pions were driven to the rootns of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, where was assetnbled the fraternity and a 11un1ber of invited guests to further .extend greetings to the returned. After a fevv n.1o1nents of conversation the company adjourned to Dobennann's, where the Betas gave a supper in honor of the occasion. T'hose present outside of the fraternity vvere, M. A .. Twiford,. D. H. !Craver, T. W. Anthony, J. I-I. Dunhatn, C. E.. Gordon, R. S. Greenrnan, Jatnes H~erring, R. B. Rowe, W. L. Terry, W. A. Catnpheli, Paul Canfield, Hennan Herring and C. E. Parsons .. After the guests had been satisfied with eatables, Mr. C1·aver was ·Called upon and act~d as toastrnaster.. Speeches were called for from nearly aH, and of course they were overflowing with wH _and eloquence. Afte1· :the banquet the people along Union Street were again retn inded of the importance of the occasion ; :a few professors were called upon f()r addresses, and then the celebration was over. Both Kilpatr,ick and Sands have conte~ted in a great nutnher of athletic gan1es this season for the N. Y. A. C., and the nutn ber of prizes and medals that each brings back testifies to the suc- cess which they have had. For tnetnbership in the international: tean1 they each receive a diatnond scarf pilil in the shape of a tnercury foot. Union is certainly glad to welcotne back these two distinguished sons. l.JQi'OI) 8, Caurea te o. Union tnet and .defeated the Laureate Boat Club, of Troy, last Saturday, in a hotly con- tested gan1e of foot-ball by a score of 8 too. While the teatn work on neither side was just what it 1night have been, there were so many brilliant individual plays that other defects were fully compensated for. Union did not play her strongest eleven; Peters, Palmer, Taylor and Bennett all being .absent from the line-up. In spite of this fact she was easily superior to her opponents in all the eletnents of foot-ball. Regardless of this, however, the ball was ad- vanced several times into dangerous proxhnity of the goal, and at one titne a touchdown was averted by the n1e.rest rnargin. All in all the

Rooker, 84, is the one which he delivered· at the religious conference at the centennial celebration last June. Dr. Rooker is secretaTy to Monsignor Satolli and holding such a position is well able to set forth a correct view of the 1·elation of the Catholic chureh to education. This he has done, and we think that it will be of int€rest to all our readers owing not only to the fac,t that it cotnes from such an important personage, but because it is a subject concerning which few people knqw anything. We have published it by special re-, quest,. and we are Inuch indebted both to Dr. Rooker and Dr. George Alexander f0r being able to do so. EVERY J.VIAN in college, and espe.cially the foot.; ball men, should read the comrnunieation which is_ found in another colurnn. The writer strikes the key note exactly. Coach Church tells us that th~

THE CONCORDIENSlS. 11 -=--==-~=========================:::::::::;::===================== n1en will not cou1e out on thne. Sorne are on the field all the afternoon \Vhile others are out for only a short tin1e. If we are to have a foot-ball team that is to be an honor to the college, the . players thernselves 1nust do as as the coach d~sires in order that the best results rnay be obtained. · They n1ust bear this fact in rnind that. a good .tear_n cannot be developed unless systematic practiCe Is indulged in, and in order to have systernatic prac- tice, each n1an n1ust be on the field at exactly the thne he is asked to appear .. h·eshmen. We n1ust depend upon them .for their nev;rs iteins. Besides, the earlier one gets to wo1·k in the competition, the better are his cha nees fo1· getting on the board next year. The editor-in-chief would be glad to confer with any 1nan who is interested in this woth.., and ii~ this way each will know exactly what will be ex- . peeted of hi:m before he enters into the compeU- t~ion. No one doubts the benefits which are to be gained throagh work of this kind whether a Inan intends to ruake journalisrn a profession or not. lt enables hl:rn to express his thoughts clearly and l'l' IS to be regretted that An1herst saw fit to . in a concise 1 nanner and it developes in him that cancel her date with Union last Saturday, for we · quality which every .one now-a-days 1nust have- had hoped to get a chance to repeat the experi- .. that of push. M . G t b Ninety-seven and ninety-eight have still ;fresh ment of last year· · anager reennlan canno · · e . laurels to win in the editorial field, and we wo:t:dd bla1ned, for he did everything possible towards . advise a hearty co-operation on the- part of ea.eh having the gam·e, but An1heTst blankly refused to ' ctass. But they will soon pass away and ninety- stand by her agreen1ent. The first excuse was · nine will he called upon to take their places. Be- that the captain could not bring his tea1n so far, gin now, and when that thne of calling comes you and the next was that they had to have a ga1ne '11 b d. home on that date, because the students were con1plaining .of the few home games. But the team went to Brooklyn, and this seems to contra- dict both of the above reasons for not wanting to play Union. Of course thel'e are n1any surn1ises · around college concerning the 1·easons why • she did not want to play us, but we 'viii not · 1nention any. THE UNION of all depart1nents of the university in .spirit, if it cannot be in reality, is what every · student of the university now desires. This de- sire has been rapidly growing in the college departrnent and is n1aking itself strongly felt in . the 1nedical :and law. Representatives of those institutions are now on all of our athletic tean1s · and n1usical organizations. All ihis draws the departments closer and closer together .and gives . thmn a common interest. But undoubtedly the · journalistic departrnent can have n1ore influence than all of these for it can reach not two or three, but all. For this purpose THE CONCORDI:B~NSIS has been enlarged, permanent space has been given to the n1edical and law, and regular corre- spondents have been appointed. But all of this has been done at the direct financial risk of the 1nanage1nent of the paper. It has all been done to help unite the university; now let the students in the departments help, let them meet the paper half-·way and show their interest in the univ.ersity. Through this paper they will learn not only of themselves, but of their fellow students, and thus their interest will be increased. The university is one; its paper giving all an equal chance should be supported by all. THE CoNCORDIENSIS wishes to urge upon the class of ninety-nine the importance of aJ?. early 1·epresentation on its board.. With an increased list of interests and undertakings in all the depart- nients it is aln1ost iinpossible to find out every- thing that is g·oing on, and especially atnong the WI e rea .y. THE MOVING force in all college and class enter- prises is spirit-college and class spirit. It is that \Vhich enters into all affairs and Inakes them a success. It holds men bound to their classes ~to support thein in all places; it fills 1nen with enthusiasin for their college. and causes thetn ~to uphold it on all occasions. Without this spirit college life would indeed be dull, and a large share of college influence on the opening life of the student would be lost. Of course the 'vork of the classroom is the Ineat of college life, but unless this is 1ninistered to by the spo1·ts of the athletic field and the recreation found in the va·rio:us organizations, the best results from studies cannot be attained. Then, since these organization:s are essential, they n1ust be 1naintained ; and theh ntaintenance depends entirely upon the interest of the students. Whatever, then, legitima.tely arouses this interest or spirit is to be encouraged, and to this end class contests and rivalries should be promote<I. But on. the other hand this class spirit should never be permitted to interfere with matters of general interest to the college. The college and its institutions are first, the class second. But too n1uch importance cannot be given to the right ld.nd of college sph·it-that spirit which will advance the college in every way. By some it has been complained that there is not so rn:uch of this spirit as there. used to be; and if this be the case, where shall we look for the cause ? Is it not beGause thete have not been enough occasions for· the arousing of enthusiasm? The reception given our returned athletes was good, but more :such are needed. Where is the spirit that cheers tne teams in practice or that meets a returned tean~ at any hou1· of the day or night, whether victol·i- ous or defeated? This is the spirit that should be manifested, not only regarding athletics, but all college enterprises. Let the students be enthu~i­ tic, and let them show that they are alive.

The curricu- . lum of a college should be of a thorough practi- . cal nature, and embrace all the natural sciences· Devj:ating fron1 the usual custon1 of giving the students a great deal of vvholeson1.e advice in refer.ence to their studies and their coHege life in general, he at once took up p.hannacy and discussed it as a science and an art. The study of past history reveals the fact that 1)harn1acy . \Vas at one time part and parcel of tnedicine, and the one who was the adviser, or prescriber, was also at !he same tin1e the dispenser of the tnedicine ; pharn1acy and tnedicine were identi- cal. It was in the thirteenth century that drug . stores can1e into existence, and the physician and the doctor pursued two distinct disciplines, the one being the prescriber and the other the con1pounder of tnedicines. 1\'he reo.1edies thus sold were derived altnost entirely fron1 the vegetable kingdorn, and consisted, in the n1ain, of teas, syrups, distilled waters and the like. The collecting of the crude tnaterial by the apothecaries thetnselves developed ~t love for botany which has been· lasting, an.cl is the tnain cause for the great advancement to that science. In titne, the duties of the apothecary nlulti- plied to such an extent that he was obliged to supply himself from the dealer in d1·ugs, and just here, in order to protect hirnself f-rotn fraud, it becatne evident that he should be able to dis- · tinguish between the different drugs oflered, and phannacy proper, n1ore with a view to turn out educated phannacists than scientists.
