Vol. LXXIV., No. 20 SC Clarifies New Election Set-Up To Be Used In Apri] Committee Appointed To Investigate Band; Question of Opening S. C. Meetings Raised The Student Council at its regular meeting lVIonday, .March 3, clarified the l'egula- tions and requirements for the election of class officers and Council rep res en tatives for the following year. Be- cause of the existing confu- sion resulting from the fact that the college is split into eight terms instead of four classes, the Council felt that definite clarification of voting regulations was necessary. Voting by Tt>rms The main point under discussion was the deterrr.ination of the group with which each man is to vote. The following arrangements were reached: Men who are in term eight and those men who plan to graduate in August may not vote; men in term one who are going to Summer Session and will be tn term three next September will vote with the Sophomore class; those men in term one who do not plan to at- tend college this 'Summer will vote next fall with the incoming Fresh- man class; all other men will vote with the class to which they now belong. Election of ciass officers will take place on April 16. The men who are elected to these offices will not be eligible for Student Council positions. Nominations for election to the Student Council must be handed in at the Student Activities Office by Wednesday, April 23. Elections will be held over a two day period, April 29-30, in order that every man may have a chance to vote. The Council is now planning to ob- tain voting machines from the city for use in the elections. Amend Constitution Mention was made of the possi- bilitieg of amending the Constitu- tion of the Student Council. One important change under discussion is the opening of all meetings of the Council to the student body. The decision will probably be made by a vote of the entire College. . A committee was formed to m- vestigate the dissolving of the Un- ion Collega Band. The committee is to ascertain the reasons for not continuing the activities of the band and is to make a report at the next meeting of the Council. Fira precautions in the dormi- tories was again the subject of dis- cussion. It was reported to the meeting that the conditions report- ed previously were being amelio- rated. trnsts FOUNDED AT UNION COLLEGE IN 1877 SCHENECTADY, N.

William Huntley Wednesday, March 5, following a meeting of the Union Col- lege Faculty Council. Retum to the term-end tests follows an unsuccessful trial of substituting extra hour tests and quizzes for final examinations in the term ending in January of the current year. The examinations will cover a~--·-~----- -- ------ ten-day period from May 26 to June 5, with te~·ts slated for morn- ing and aite.rnoon at 8:30 and 1:30. A tentative schedule has been work ed out and will be released for publication as soon as antid- pated flaws are eliminated, the Dean reported. Council to Sponser Dance on March 15 In view of the decided succe~\S of the informal dance held in the Alumni Gymnasium following the RPI basketball game, the 'Student Council will sponsor another such affair after the game with Wagner College the night of March 15. Once again the dance will begin· at ten and run until one o'clock. Band Unlike Othet· Organizations The minimum figme of 30 is con-. trolled mainly by the number of d.ifferent instruments in a band. Scores are written for a definite ratio of one type instrument to an- other, and when the total number of pieces in the band drops below 30 the 1·aHo can no longer be mair.- tained, with a resultant lowering of the quality of the music. Fmther- more, all the members must be present not only at concerts and other events but also at rehearsals. Any musical ensemble function~ as a unit and hence must rehearse and play as a unit. With the number of men !educed below the minimum of 30, Profes- sor Male sti.JI tried to produce something that sounded like music by rewriting the scores to cover up for the missing instruments. How- ever, when members s•tarted to drop below 24 in the past few weel<s, he decided that furthet· ac- tivity was a farce and a waste of time both to hi~self and to the men who did appear at rehearsals. Lack of Credit Cited Chief cause of failing interest was the lack of credit for the work the men were doing. Most schools of Union's size include the band in the curriculum. Definite class hours are assigned for rehearsals and ·one hour credit in music is In giving the examinations, the gymnasium will first be filled, and the overflow will be alloted to the Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, ar.d other buildings. The process will be difficult for both students and faculty, with considerable crowding of the test- ing rooms expected, the Dean pre- dicted. Conflicts reE>ulting from students having two examir.ations at the same hour on the same day will be given individual attention. The music will be provided this given.

B_'ar- rel spol{e yesterday on tJ;e. atms and functions of the Dl~SIOn of Science. This lecture was the third in a series sponsored. by the Stu- dent Council to better acquaint the studer.ts with o11r four main divi- sions of study. Professor Farrell used the slo- gan \Serving through Science\ as a possible motto for division III. In answer to his question, \Why are Mathematics required for all students?\ he gave three responses First. a general knowledge of Mathematics is necessary to under- stand something about the many· new fields that have been opened during the war years. His sec·ond · answer was that all Mathematics are complementary to other courses, such as history, or the culture of races. Our· present- day civilization has attained its present heights only through mathematical and scientific Pl'O- gress; as R matter of fact, he said, all sciences are based on mathe- matical calculations. For his third· answer, he added that mathematics are required for the simple reason that a committee said so. ThiEl committee was set up a year and a half ago to pro- pose a postwar Liberal Arts pro- gram. Their recommendation was based on five main points: to sup- ply the student with a capacity for (1) abstract thinking, (2') und.er- standirg natural phenomenon, <3) applying science to society, (4). the appreciation of values and (5) the ability to live and to cooperate with othei'S. In order to obtain a faun-· dation for abstract thinking, the student must take Mathematics.

Althuug h these faiths az·e un- der many t-i ties. the main differ- ence is where they stress-their em- phasis of worship. The Lutheran faith is centered on the Gospel and is sometimes known as the Evan~elical or \good news for the world,\ continued Reverend Jen~en. \Good newc• was Jesus Christ, come to seek and save\ and all ,of us have work to do for the fut the ring of Cht·istian- ity. \When the Council of Chmches is finally a reality, it will be an or- ganization that will further the brotherhood of man by sevel'ing the great imagined differences between chm·ches.''

Vol. LXXIY,.t No. 21 \.~lli$[~·~.Arn~ll F,F Speaker, W:arns US of Inner Danger• \One Freedom\ Stressed As Basic; Claims South Chained Ellis Gibbs Arnall, former governor ef Georgia, voiced his plans for world peace and freedom in his talk at Memo- rial Chapel Monday evening, March 10. Arnall, recently prominent in the news be- cause of the gubernatorial contest in his home state, spoke under the auspices of Freednm Forum. Mal~e \New world\ Here Governor Ar.nall stressed the fact that freedom and the idea of \One World\ were closely linked. He further said that human nature is such .as to make people prone to improve other people and other countries to the exclusion of im- proving themselves. \We must get our own house in order and start making the new world right where we a_re,\ he said. He pointed out that there is much disagreement in the world today as to how to keep the peace. Some think a strong Army and Navy and more destructive weap- ons like the atom bomb wlll pre- vent anotther war. \However he said, \war cannot be prevented merely by being prepared for it or by creating more horrible weapons.\ The best hope of maintaining peace in our world is the United Nations, he declared. Only One Freedom ' D~ ~ l.igon to Hold Reading Tests S~~ed of R~ading Experiment; · '$tudents wishing· to p~i·tici­ pate in the experiment on im- proving speed of reading should plan to attend four consecutive lectures of ;psychology 1b, to be held in the Old Chapel. They may attend either Section 1 or Section 2 for four times. For Section 1, these four periods would. he: Tuesdays, 1:30---April 8, 15, 22, 29-0ld Chapel. For Section 2, these four periods would be: Thursdays, 3:30 - April 10, 17, 24, May 1-0ld Chapel. Those who are not members of these classes should plan to stay the full hour on the first and last of these four s13ssions, and probably 15 minutes the other two. All members of the student body who wish to im- prove their speed of reading are cordially invited to par- ticipate. Ernest M.

Pointing out that Schenectady, as a community. can offer little- or no help in providing homes for new faculty members, Dr. Davids-en said that the only way .for the Col- lege to retain these men is to .pro- vide houses for them.

Special attention will be paid to the num- ber and age of children in a family and the urgency of the request. We next aslted Governor Arnall about the political and social fu- ture of Georgia and the entire South. His answer was that pros- pects for the South are bright; that the South will be the next great liberal section of the country. Liber·al causes according to Arnall, appeal most to the underprivileged, but only when they have become sufficiently educated to seek that which is to their advantage. He further stressed that education which is finding new impetus in the South, is the one great pre- requisite for social and political improvement. year's competition. five of the strongest candidates Voting Rules Cltl'nged The reason for discontinuing the experiments, which were part of a program for the study of various· Lechniques of prediction in the so- cial studies, said Professor Larra- bee, is that the rules of the voting have been changed so drastically that there is little or no basis left upon which to make a prophecy.

IiI ·,. ''Nels'' Nitchman '30 Logical Man For 1947 [i'lootball Coach Post Mel Hein's resignation as head football eoach, announced Monday evening, came as a sunilrise and a shock to many .persons on campus. Hein has accepted a job as assistant coach with the Los Angeles Dons professional team and will Ieave Union within a month t6 assume his new duties. tiona few years ago, then resigned for a more lucrative job at Colby College. He is now head football and basketball coach at the U. S. Coast Guard Academy. 1t is highly probable that Nitchman would return to Union if he were offered the inducements Hein was given to come here. on various athletic teams of the Garnet. He began a coach~ ing career at Union and served here for about ten years, as assistant and later h.ead coach in both football and basket~ ball. Nitchman left Union in 1941 to take over coaching ·duties at Colby, where he hung up a good recm·d before going in service. This action leaves Union without a football coach for the 1947 season, a .not to0 pleasant !}roblem to face. It has also caused much comment on campus as to who would make a logica!l successor to Hein. Students unfamiliar with the Unhm of the last decade will be interested to know that it was Nitchman who coached the Union grid team through an undefeated team in 1939. This alone should be proof of his ability, but if not, a glance at his record at the Coast Guard Academy will do so. When Nitchman left Union he said that his thoughts would always be with his Alma Mater. Therefore, we would like to see the Athletic Department take immediate steps to return another of Union's capable sons ,to the banks of the Mohawk, whei'e he might further MiNerva's gloi:y.

Bob has the comedy part, which requires a quiclt mind and skillful tongue to do justice to Richard Sheridan's work. The play is a comedy, which makes his· part comedy, on a background of comedy and must be very well done to stand out at all. Bob was doing just that, from what we saw. The picture· begins with sho.ts of 17th Century London and the famous Globe Theater, where Henry V is being played. Every detail of the Elizabethan theater has been painstakingly reproduced including the orange girls, nobles on the stagce, and the rabble in the pit. The French court, in fragility, elegance, spaci·ousness and color, is probably the most enchanting single set ever to appear on the screen. Almost every shot of the French court is like a pre-Renais- sance painting. The battle scene, the most remembered part of the film, begins with a long range shot of the bannered, advancing French army i nail its glorious might, then to a close-up of the pitiful rem- nants ·Of the once well equipped English force. The next scene is the most spectacular of the whole battle; the grand charge of the cream of the French chivalry, in glorious array across the green fields only to be cut to ribbons by the deadly bows of the· English yoemen. This film is of especial value to all literature maj.ors for both its historical value and its presenta- tion of Shakespeare at its best.

Dick Roberts was again top play maker. Jayvees Close Season Pete Nistead's jayvee squad de- feated the Eagles 52-34 to end a very successful season under their new mentor. Losing only one game to R.P.I., which they later avenged, the juniors won five games for a season mark of 4-1.

Things still appe!l,r to be in the elementary stages for the cage is not due to be ready for use until Thursday, and until that time, activity is re- stricted to pepper games, throwing to the plate, and batting grounders. New men report each day, som·e veterans of last year's fine club, some who starred here before hte war, and many new men who are waiting eagerly for the chance to shoW just what they have to offer to Coach Lawrence. Noticeable among those who have returned to once again wear the Garnet of Union are \Mule\ Haas, Truman Rice and Ed Br-eeding. Coach Lawrence is counting heavily on those who return from last year's powerful club. Among those who last season piled up such a fine record are Bob Bartlett, Carl Arm- strong, Harry Philo, an.d Mr. Slug- ger himself, Hal Enstice. The pitchers have begun to throw to the plate, and their real ability is beginning to show itself. No cuts have been made yet, but Coach Lawrence, although he hasn't committed himself, pretty well knows who has his stuff, and who hasn't.
