Soiree in Dece1nber At a meeting of the Junior Class after chapel Thursday, it was voted to hold the ] unior Prom in February. Several members of the J ttnior class were in favor of holding the affair in May, but a large majority of th·e class favored the earlier date. Earl Vaughn, the chairman of the committee, an- nounced that efforts were go[ng to be made to secure Wittstein and Ward's orchestra to play at the £.unction again this year. The purpose of the class in having the dance right after the close of the first semester was to even up the time between the Sophomore Soiree and the Senior Ball. \Shorty\ DeBois have been showing •!• President William . an et - •\' periment and a. use o t e tmagm~tton. d ff d h t .1 ales 1• 11 t!Je· •t• son of Smith College, will lecture •!+ Science has ltttle use unless rt be. goo stu an ave orn ·1 . h 1 \Th .. . . . .

The a111mal faH meeting of the Board of Trustees of ·union Univer- sity was held on October 28, Tuesday o.f this week A number of matters of unusual importance to t'he s]tudent body were brought to the attention of this Board. President Richmond in opening the meeting, announced to the Trustees that H. Melville Hanna, LL. D., ·O.f Cleveland, 0., a member of the class of 1860, had contributed $25,000 tow- ards the fund for the erection of a memorial chapel. At this meeting the campaign for the new chapel was formally inaugurated with $88,000 \in hand out oi the $200,000 necessary for erection. \'While the present incapacity of the chape1 is no doubt a source of delight to those Sen.iors who only have to attend half the time, it is nevertheless a sad state of affairs that must he remedied. The proposed chapel is· to be a memorial to those twenty-six Union men who paid the supreme sacrifice in the \Vorld vVar. The Board has raised the entrance requirements to fifteen units, whereas only fourteen have been necessary in the past. It~ addition the Board has also stipulated that all technical men must take a course in elementary economics. This action arises from the recommendation of Dr. E. W. Rice, president of the General Electric Company, and a trustee of the col- lege. Dr. Rice . thinks it is a vital rna tter that all technical men should have this training in this day and generation. This lack of sound economic training is daily empha.:.. sized by current events. The schedule of tuition was also re- arranged, the Board making a flat rate for all men in college. The tuition for the technical and pre-medical courses will be $225 a year; the A. B. and B. S. men will pay $140. This sum includes everything except 1athletic fees. New men entering next year will pay $250 or $150 per year, accord~ng to their classification. Certain significant figures were \ brought up at the meeting, showing the growth of the college. In the past ten years the budget of the col- lee has trebled; in the same period the endowments have more than trebled. Registration in 1909 total 326 undergraduates; this year's registra- tion numbers 615. In addition to the undergraduates there are at present 40 res~dent graduate stude11ts and 344 others taking the extension courses.

He had no faith in the \hypo- critical rigorists\ of the Church, as Dr. Neilson termed the members of the \kirk sesslions,\ who tried breeches of th·e moral code and having been brought !before them for offenses, the poet was none too gentle in his treat- ment of them. These satirical poems are written for the most part in dia1ect, contrasting with his so-called \preach- ing poems,\ which a-re written in Eng- lish. •The reason which Dr. Neilson ascribes to this difference is the fact that as· the Bible w.a·s written in Eng- lish, that language came to be the ve- hicle ·of rhetoric, while· the dialect was the mode of expression of the com- mGn people in aommon circums.tances.

In the first half the pigskin was never out of Columbia's territory and twice the Garnet almost scored a touchdown. Once when a forward pass. was tipped and spoiled for \Heine\ Goff. who was over the line, and again when Lyman had made a beautiful end run only to have the ba.U bro.\1ght hack fifteen :;ards for holding. Law Comstock led the team like the general he is. \Hal'' 'Wittner made his home town friends sit ur and take notice. Homer Goff was in every ·play and played a game that was beyond reproach. In the line Captain Hanley, Eisenberg, DuBois, Gregory and Beekman showed the winning punch while Hany Foster and Art N otman worked like Trojans on the ends. Beyond question was the fight of the team and at tin1es when things went slightly wrong the boys were up and at them with the spirit and fight that must win. Once after Shaw, one of Columbia's star half- backs, had made an excellent end run the Union line tightened up and was as so much steel and the ball went to Union on her own ten yard line. Time and again when the ball was in Union's territory, Columlhia was up against a stonewa,ll. In the third quarter Eisen- berg sustained a sprained ankle and Klein went in to replace him and acquitted himself well. Law Com- stock was injured in the last quarter and had to be taken O·Ut. \Vittner re- placed him while Murray took Hal's place. First Quarter. Eisenberg kicked off to Columbria's 25-yard line. Columbia failed to gain and punted. The ball was a bit slip- pery and Goff fnm.bled and recovered on the next .!llay. He took the ball again and gained. Lyman carried the ball through for a good gain. Colum- bia penalized for off-side. Union first down. Hal went throt1gh the line for two yards. Comstock made three around the end. Wittner added three more. Columbia again penal- ized for off-side and it was Union''s first again. Union failed to make the ten and Hal punted. Columbia failed to gain and \Thornton punted. Union failed t•o gain and Hal pumted. Colum- bia made her first down. Hal Witt- ner intercepted a forwal'd pass and rail (Co11:tinued on page .o!)

The New York, Nov. 1st, 1919. \Union played Columbia to a standstill on So·uth Field yesterday in a game of football \~-'hich leaned first one way and then the other, like Pisa's fa-mous tov\·e,r, and ended in a 0 to 0 score. \The men from Sche-nectady have been charged with lack of fight, lad< of organization and lack of everything-, since their crushing de- feat at the hands of \Yeslcyan a week agu, Lut they said nothing, gritted their teeth, threw aside an appJ.rent indifference and refuted every charge in a way which sent every Union man home with a feel- ing of elation. ''They not only plaved a game that might well have been a win- ning- ;Tame on a dry .field and with dry ball, but they showed a fight and drive from end to end which did much to save a game which they could not win. '•It was a case of two ·well-coached, well-matched teams which might have gone on inclefinitel:,-' without either being 2hlc to gain a winning adyantage. and Columbia earned equal credit with Union for th(· fig-ht made and the game played on a soggy, muddy field, and with the bal las slipepry as the metaphorical greased pig.\ Let us congrtulate Columbia _nupon her excellent defense against with the ball as slippery as the metaphoTical greased pig.\ The Obsolescent Art. The college has recognized the need of a course in argumenta- tion and debate and has established it. But with the advance of thic; science in the curriculum a corresponding decline has o•ccurred 1n the interest in debating as an extra-curriculum activity. This in- different attitude towan-d a matter which used to occupy a promin- ent place in every college, is bound to be reflected in the history of the coming generation. Oratory and debate. in Congress today fail to inspire the inter- est which attended the Lincoln-Douglas contention.s of half a cen- tury ago. It cannot be that the iss-ues are less :important; the League of Nations is something to quibble about. In fact, the speeches which have ben made about it seem to be regarded more as quibblings than debates. They do not receive .the profound inter- est of the public; a certain dignity is lacking. Whether the oratory of today must become old in order that its merits s-hall become ap- preciated is doubtful. There are not, in the rhetoric of today, the essentia-ls which made Lincoln's speech at Gettysburg, or Web- Stter's at Bunker Hill, classics for all ages. institutions of higher learning, and Editor The Concordiensis: particularly the coleges of liberal arts, Union College and the under- should leave on their graduates the graduates thereof have 110 apologies mar of distinction in the use of the to make for the football eleven of languag·e.

The !Sreat moralists of the ages haYe striven, not without con-: siderable disagreen1ent, to postulate the characteristics o£ the ideal gentleman. All seem rnorc or less settled upon the point that the observer of the \golden mea11\ is that ideal; he who is neither too ascetic nor yet too maHeahle. The ground of difference lies in the means bY which such a result is to be achieved. Cicero treated the subject in his letters to his son; Hm~ace argued it in verse; Plutarch dre·w from his \pasture of great souls\; Spenser in his \Faicrie Queene\ strove to \fashion a gentleman of noble person in young• women congregate in an instit1l1tion of lea.rning, they quick·ly ·discover that they have interests outside the class room a:nd apart from hours which they rcserv.e .for inteHectual work.

Many prophesy a reaction from the moclern tendency of specialization to a curriculum >vhich will be broader in its aspect. The advocates of intensiYe education build their rloctrines upon the old theory \from one, know all'' implying- that the human mind is of such meager dim.ensions that one phase o£ the world's work is sufficient to demand its whole output of thought and energy. In direct opposition to this hypothesis, a Union professor ex- pressed his views on the subject by stating that his ideal schoQl \vas the school which would nicely combine engineering, scien- tific and academic training, and yet not lose sight of the importance of athletics. In this last activity, he ernphasized the value of the so- called minor sports like tennis, golf, and so forth, arguing that in the after life o.f the student these can be brought into usc as methods of physical development, whereas football and baseball will seldom be played outside of college. \The unive.rsity being a place of study, a student has no right to neglect his stud i·es even for r.thical and religious work or edi- fication, and mt1ch less to gratify an histronic ambition, or to win the so-called 'honor' of elrction to the editorial or managing board of some undergradnatc- publication. ''The chief end of tbe stmleHt is to stu;dy. So long as he is privileged to remain in the university, so long as these precious years of preparation for life are vouchsafed to hi,m, his supren'lc duty is to study hard. \In man there is nothing great bttt mind.

There are in- deed ancillary activities, but essentially considered, student activi- ties are stllldious activities.\ Dr. Schurman's \happy medium\ is the \summum bonum\ of the ancient philosophers, the \gentle discipline\ of the :NGddle Ages, the \temperance in all things,\ of the modern moralists. The love of moralizing has continued down the ages, and the echo of the previous generation has been heralded anew in each succeeding one. The relation of cause and effect has been thrashed out a thou- sand times. Each generation has loved a golden mean as much as any other. There is no 1onger any need to dwell on what it is,- who, when, where, and why have lost their magnetism. There is but one word todav, \HO\Y?\ . \How shall we dea·l with extra-curriculum activities in the future?\ is the question before Union College today, and its con- sideration commends the thought of the best mi,nds in the faculty and student body. The Inspiration of Engineering. (By Prof. Frank P. McKibben). The criticism has been made of Union that it supports too manY extra-curriculum activities. This is not exactly the case. There should be as many activities as the whole :aggregation of students has hob hies. The fault to be found in Union's activities is that there are too few men participating in them, and in order to keep things going the work is apportioned upon the shouldeors of a few. The value of athletics ca11not he over-estimate, but the benefits of physica.l developn1.E'nt go to a compa.ratively small number of men.

For mere lack Opportunities in Engineering. of time they cannot d() their best in any and have to slight all a Engineering now affords greater opportunities for success than little. Work becomes drudgery for the participant, and he is the ever before. Many young men enter the profession each year and only beneficiary. The great mass of the students gain little from they have manY chances to show .ability anrl reap the benefits of the reading of his hurried editorials and quickly constructed de- industry, for never 1)efore have there been problems of greater bates, while he comes to reflect only the dull monotony of doing' magnitude and importance than await solution at the .present time. one task after another and lacks the glow of enthusiasm which is Opportunities exic;t in abunclance for reducing g.reat eco·nomic and necessary to produce excellence.

Wherever, therefore, human beings some together, to engage in work, other interests spring up, find expression :;.nd receive attentioH. \We say that the good citiz·en is the man who not only does faithfully his daily wo1·k, but who gives some care also to the inter- ests of the community in which he lives and of the state and nation to which he belongs. \Somewhere a 1ine must be draw11 between the two groups of competing claim~. There is a happy medium if one can only find it. \What takes place in that state on a large scale finds its· counter- part in the university. \The university is primarily a place to study. As an institU'tion, study is what justifies its exic;tence. But when young men and Most of the young men who join the profession an willing to spend four years of time, and, \vhat to many of them are, large sums of money, for training in our tecbnical schools and colleges. Others, for lack of resourct\s or for other reasons, enter the raJnks di·1~ectly without the preliminary training. By whatever path they find their way into the great profession of engineering, they should 1:\ealize that it is only by diligence, perseverance and a high-minded 1·egard for its traditions and its ethics that theY can ultimately occupy positions of responsibility ancl trust. Every boy who enters the engineering profession should do so because of his love 1or the work and because he is better fitted for it than for any other calling.

Besides, the fact that I've had a couple bad corns on my right foot for the last two weeks and haven't been abl'e to play much has sort of disheartened the team, and since they don't seem to get any better for all the Blue Jay plasters· I've used, I guess I'll have to call off any more playing this year.

They are ,also frattght with golden opportunities for the college. The school that does not seek to build the inside forces of her students is not serviBg her generation. Today, when ideals a:re confused, and wrong-, and injustice is rampant in the land, the stttdent who. does not devdo-p these inside forces is \'following wandering fires, lost in the quagmire.\ The thing most needed is not to whiten the seas with the SJa:ils of commerce, nor to erect marble to the fortieth story. The student who will make the greatest contribution in the futuo.-e will be the one who adds to the quality rather than the q1,1antity of her en-ergy and interest h1to a bit of me about class matters.

For back of it is the General Electric Com- pany's main office building, accommodating 2300 employees. And just next door is its laboratory with tbe best equipment for test- ing, standardizing; and research at the com- mand of capable engineers. Then down the street-a mile long-are other buildings where everything; electrical, from the small- est lamp socket to the huge turbines for electrically prope]ed battleships, is made by the 20,000 electrical work~rs who &lily stream through. What a story this gate weuld tell, if it could, of the leaders of the electrical industry and business, of ambassadors from other insti- tutions and from foreign lands. The story would be the history of electric lighting, electric transportation, electric in- dustrials and electricity in 1he home. · This gateway, as well as the research, en- gineering, manufacturing and commercial resources back of it, is open to all who are working for the betterment of the eleFtrical industry.
