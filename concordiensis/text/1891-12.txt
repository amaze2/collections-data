(Continued.) Tl1e last orator that the time will allow me to present is Wen dell · Phillips. This man was the occa- sion of a new. definition of oratory. \The perfection of oratory is the per- fection of talking.\ If any person has ever lived who acquired this art of talking to perfection that person was Wendell Phillips. He was rightly called the silver-tongt1ed. Though possessing by nature all the gifts of the orator, he cultivated his powers with the most persistent effort. He conducted himself on the platform-- even before the largest audiences-as tl1ough he was conversing to a. few acquaintances 'in a dra·wing-room. You lost sight of the fact that he was making a speech. Probably no speeches when read simply ever gave so false an impression of the manner of theiP delivery. One would naturally think Fron1 these facts concerning some of the greatest orators of the worlcl, selected from all ages and countries,. what follows~ What indt1etio11s have we a right to . draw from them ? What observations can we justly make concerning the conditions of successful oratory ? We will observe firRt of all the non-essentials to st1ccess in this matter . 1. .A fine physique, though a gi~eat help to a public. speaker, is one of these non-essentials. Demosthenes and Cice-ro were both of them men of feeble co11.stitution, and no one doubts of their success. ~[.lhiers was so insignificant in person as to be almost an object of ridicule, and Robert Hall possessed Sllch feeble physical powers that there was hardly a day in his life when he was. free from suffering.
