Starting out of New York some beautiful June morning, seated on the deck of one of the elegant steamers of the Hudson River Day Line, the picture presented is as won- derful as it is varied. The bay and harbor of New York presents the appearance of a seemingly endless pro- cession of tugs, steam boats, lighters, tows, ferry boats and every manner of sailing craft imaginable. To the southward we behold the enchanting panorat11a in the New York harbor, and glancing over the great city we can easily see towering above the other buildings the spires and domes of many noted edifices, including Trinity Church spire, the Western Union 'Telegraph Company's Build- ing, St. Paul's Church and the buildings of the lrib1tne and Tim.es.

When the facl:l ~ty allow us, every fortnight. a certain amount of · time, taken out of our regular recitation tirne, in which to hold our student mass meetings, · it is a privilege that we ought to accept with a great deal of heartiness. Not only is the · chapel a very convenient place to hold these meetings, but the time at which we are allowed to hold them is also very convenient for us, being as it is immediately at the con- clusion of the chapel exercises, at which all the students are supposed to be present. This does not necessitate the trouble of C(i)·l- lecting the men together for they are already collected and they only have to wait befofe beginning the business of the meeting until the faculty have left the chapel. Now it would seem that every student oug;h t to take a great deal of interest in these college meet- ings, much more even than in his own class meetings, but this is not the case with some. Regularly, just before a college meeting .. a certain number of the men get up and leave, see1ningly caring no more about what is to be done in regard to some base ball or fo.ot ball matter, or other i tern of interest that is to engage the attention of the students, than they do as to the whereabouts of the man · don't Hke the men who are nom~inated for · some .office get up and notnina:te someone . else and if he is the best man he will probably get elected. If you have some plan or idea that would be of interest to the students don't be afraid to get up and state it. lt is a fact, and a £act to be regretted, that the Juniors and Seniors do most of the talking at the college meetings, while the members of the two lower classes seen1 to think that they are prohibited from speaking their sentiments. This mistaken idea is not to be encouraged. Every ~man, Freshman or Senior, has an equal right as regards speaking in these meetings and we, for our part, \Vould like in the future to hear more from the underclassmen. But even if you don't care to take an especia11 y active part in these meetings, make it a point to attend every college meeting that is held during your college career and your standing among your fellow students wUl becotne higher and your chances for becoming an honor n1an in your studies will not be lowered by so doing. * Now :hat the foot ball season has passed so successfully. there corn es the question of making the base ball season as successful. There is one thing absolutely necessary, viz: that the men go in to the

THE CONCORDIENSIS. -- -~~~-=c=-c-~-'--- --~ ~- ~- ~---~- -~-- ---- ~ ~- -------~---~ =====;=============~=-=---=--~=- =~=--~~-=-====--=- \ gyrn \ for regular practice. The practice has al:ready com tnenced and it is to be hoped that more men may make their appearance. The Freshmen have some good material · which will be developed by the compulsory . '' gyrn '' work they are now doing. All the ~ positions on the nine are open to competition and every tnan has the san1e footing at the start, so that no one need despair of gainjng a position frotn the fact that the position has been heretofore filled by someone now in . college. If the aspirant can better fill the position it will be his. The time set for prac- tice in throwing the ball is from two to three. The bar.k stop will then be in position, and all the rnen are urged to take as much as possible of the practice. General exercise is from thr~ee to four, and class exercise from four to five. Every man should be present at one of these hours. * * * ANOTH\ER i rnportant factor in the success of the base ball season is the finances. A new scheme has just lately been decided upon by the students to raise the necessary money for base ball expenses. The idea is to give a grand production of the tuneful little opera of H. M. S. Pinafore. The members of the glee club and a fevv other students, whose voices are fitted for it, will constitute the male chorus, and also take some of the leading parts. The fern ale parts will be taken by a number of the best singers among the young lad1es in the city. The two or three leading male parts will probably be taken by certain men in the city who are recognized as accomplished actors and ~ingers. This performance is bound to be a success from an artistic point of view, but nevertheless it needs the hearty support of everyone in col- lege. Let every stu dent, for the honor of Alma Mater and the success of the ball nine, constitute himself a comn1ittee of one to see that the opera house is crowded with specta- tors on both nights of the performance of Pinafore. The opera will probably be given on the evenings of Feb. 5 and 6 at the Centre Street ·'Opera House. CRE.MA TION .. HE annual cremation of Algebra occurred too late for n0tice in the last 1 CoNcOR-- DIENSlS. This in1portant event of Fresh- man year took place on the raorni ng of Dec. 17th. For some time previous ciass spirit ran high. Both Sophomores and Ffeshmen thought themselves deeply wronged and vre pared to avenge with blood the insults and indignities they had suffered. The Freshmen were very cautious and secr,et in their movements and strove in ·every way to outwit the Sophon1ores. As the end of the term drew near and the time within which the Cremation must occur was narrowed down, the excitement increased and various conjectures were made concern- ing the exact date. Preparations w·ere com- pleted and about three o'clock in the tnorning the :B\\'reshmen began to gather in Memorial Hall which vvas to be their starting point. Here they dressed thetnselves to suit the occasion and awaited the arrival of the drum corps. Out of respect for the wishes of President Webster the march was confined to the college grounds. At the conclusion of the march the body was cremated with appropriate ceren1onies and the two classes shook hands and par·ted as friends. The nun1ber of outsiders present was very small and the affair passed off quietly. REVIEWS_ The Christmas number of the Columbia Spectator lies before us. It is a very inter- esting nun1ber. The literary work is original and varied. The number is made especially attractive by the many cuts that head the articles. The ,poetry is pleasant and witty. The \gags\ are for the most part new. One article, a story entitled \ The Night Before Christmas,\ is especially noticeable. It is

THE CONCORDTENSIS. 7? - ------ - ------;----- -------------- ----··· . -- --·. -- --- --- well written and very suggestive. The scenes and characters there depicted doubtless will be recognized by many a college man as being exoeedingly realistic. Indeed the editors of the Spectator are to be congratulated on the production of so well written, so weH illus- trated and so entertaining a ni1mbe;. The 7iiftonian for Christmas is a credit to its editors. It is interesting froni the begin- ning to the end. The editorials are thought- ful and well written. There is an abundance of literary work much of which, unlike that con1mon in -most college periodicals, is inter- esting to the outside world. Especial1y is this true of the articles entitled \ Some Famous Literary Workshops.\ There are several pieces of poetry of son1e merit but. which are of a rather more serious strain than that which is generally found in college papers. The paper as a whole is a thought- ful production and presents much literary ability. H.A RV ARD'S BETTER SELF. The stal)dard of conduct at Harvard is not only higher now than forn1erly, but it com- pares favorably with contemporary colleges. When a recent class took their Commence- ment dinner together at the Hotel Bruns- wick, barely a man \vas intoxicated in a class of over two hundred.
