In order to accomplish this goal the committee sought to allocate funds sparingly,. audit these funds carefully, and initiate fund raiSing programs to supplement tax revenue. Throughout the fall term, the committee met with a representative from each student activity. At these meetings, the committee reviewed the financial activities of each organization for the past year and the year to come.

This · announcement was received with mixed reactions froin many groups on campus, including the Planning and Priorities Committee. The committee, which makes all policy decisions concerning budgetary matters on campus, decided to require that all use of the President's discretionary fund for faculty hiring be subject to the approval of the Educational Policy Committee (EPC). In effect, the committee said that the President should not hire the Art Historian without the permission of the EPC. fund to . pay his. salary. l.f the . hiring were approved.by. the EPC it would become a part of an overall program, the funding of -which will be sec1,1red before the EPC approves. it. Without EJ>C appro'-:~1_ arbitrary. expenditu~es by the President might.come back the next ye;tr to haunt the Planning and Priorities Committee. Professor Joseph Macieriello, chairman of the Planning and Priorities committee, stressed the point that the committee was not acting in any way against the President. The committee is \not attempting to hamper the Prestdent or his use of the discretionary fund.\ The committee is just making sure that the \full implications\ of the action are dealt with. BONNER DISAGREES in· existing- programs and·.: wait ·many. years· before chaa_ge can be programmed m. Bonner feels that \too much power; through the lack of challenges, has .been· given to the (governance) structure\ and feels that the discretionary ·fund should retain as much autonomy as possible. There exists · no official definition of the powers of the discretionary fund and other than size this appear~ to be the only limit imposed on it. As it turns out the EPC approved the appointment of an · Art Historian out of the President's discretionary fund making any further discussion of this specific case meaningless. The larger question dealing with educational innovation and who has responsibility for it is still unanswered and will have to be dealt with by the college at some future date. ' . .. . .. .... , ... : = ·~ ... l . ~ .... ~. Temporary Personnel Director Ambrusko GOVERNANCE SYSTEM The concern of the committee in this matter. seems to be a preservation of the governance system and the avoidance of unwanted and unexpected costs in coming years. The first argument for the action taken is the fact that there presently exists a structure through which educatio11al change can occur and the idea of allowing the President the freedom to hire extra faculty undercuts the authority and legitimacy of that structure, namely the EPC. Only if EPC is consulted prior to any such action will any such violation be avoided. President Bonner does not totally agree with the committee action or with Professor Macieriello. He sees the problem as more basic and crucial than does the committee. For Dr. Bonner the question that has come up is one of educational Discussion Group Meets The second argument is a concern over where the money is going to come from should the Art Historian remain for more than one year and the president decide not to use· his discretionary innovation and leadership. The Sports. Schoolwqrk. The last governance structure, as it exists test. The next test. Girls (or Guys, now, resists most innovation. This de·pending). It seems that most usually works out for the best as conversation around Union new programs are very carefully revolves . around these topics. scrutinized before they can be Granted, there are other big implemented. Although it is subjects, such as the latest way to necessarily slow this .screening get high or .how bad the weather process prevents innovations that is. And if you're desperate, you superficially seem good but lack 'can always fall back on standard inherent educational value from topics: majors, next term's coming to fruition. In certain courses, and hometowns. cases, however, Bonner feels that On the whole, this is all far quick innovation on a small scale removed from the intellectual fare is necessary in getting the college most of us expected when we moving toward one goal or began college. While no one another. Without some financial '1magined that we would all leeway the college can get mired parade about in robes and mortarboard spouting Kant and Camus, some did hope to be able to talk about something a little more profound than how much you can drink without getting sick,. or the marvels of nitrous oxide. . That's the complaint. Here's the idea: Informal discussions. Spontaneous debate. Intelligent talk. Beginning sometime in the next few weeks, the Positive Action Group will sponsor discussions: For tlie most j:iart,- these will center around the novels and ideas of writers such as Ayn Rand (whom many here already know and love), JRR Tolkien (Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit),· Carlos Casteheda, Sylvia Plath and Saul Bellow. 11tese discussions will occur in small groups and will meet in different places at. different times. ].nterested faculty members will be invited. The discussions will be free and as spcmta-neous as J'Ossible. There will be no ·tests. So if yo'u start feeling mentally starved and want to share ideas .and feelings, look for these <liscussions in the days to come. Placement Office Federal job information centers and area offices.

The chances that the athlete will go to an Ivy League school are much better, and this ha~pers the coaches' recruiting efforts. Other complaints of NESCAC were: due to restrictions on some ,post-seaso~ tournaments, the league doesn't let the athletes excel to their fullest levels; there are no league standings for the athletes to strive for; and there is .no requirement that NESCAC schools have to play each other, something in which Harkness expressed a desire; since the ·hockey team plays only two of the other ten NESCAC schools. Some of the coaches expressed fears that there could be scheduling difficulties if Union .pulled out of NESCAC. Cahill admitted that he would hate to lose the five NESCAC teams that play Union in football. Scanlon said that he had heard a rumor that the other NESCAC schools : yvo:q.ld'· nQ~. play·. us. if we left NESCAC, but he added that if he could be assured of a good schedule, he would rather leave NESCAC.

Professor Marrin of the Chemistry Dept. would rather see Union do what it feels is best, and if NESCAC wants to kick us out of the league for violating the rules~ that's their business. But .if , they accept our actions, then we have gained much. · Clint Braywood, President of Schenectady Chemicals, is very sure that the business community will support Union more if Union drops out of NESCAC. Al Verrigni, President of the Hockey Boosters, feels that the businesss community would support Union's. capital campaigns for reasons of identifying with the school and the hockey team. The arguments for going to Division I in hockey or not were just as numerous as for the NESCAC issue. Professor of History Joe Finkelstein believes that the faculty as a whole weuld be against going to Division I in hockey. He also believes that since the faculty makes or breaks a college, in this case it would not be wise to go to Division I. Professor of Electrical Engineering Ed Craig, told the Committee that he's not so sure that the faculty is so against going Division I. Professor of Administration and Management Joe Maciariello looked at the Divison I question from a financial aspect only. Due to increasing costs, new money has to come from somewhere other than from tuxtlon. Maciariello thinks that Division I hockey can supply the school with that extra money. Maciariello estimated that the extra cost of Division I would be $29,000 but student Trustee Andy Koblenz is not convinced that the figure is that low .because Maciariello failed to include any additional coaches, trainers, or a Sports Information Director in his computations. Coach Cahill spoke ,of instances where teams have not only made big money in sports, but they have lost big money too. Koblenz remarked that the benefits of Division I seemed to be mostly on economic lines, when they should be educational. Student body President Jim Trump added that since sports are for the benefit of the students, if the students get no benefit out of sports, sports should not be here. In effect, there should be more to sports tlian getting a name for Union that the alumni can boast about. D·ue to the increased competition for students among schools similar to Union, AI Verrigni feels that Union must sell and market the school. To do this, identity is needed. Verrigni sees Division I hockey as a a great way to get' Union's name out in the forefront. This point was echoed by Rich Guardian, another student who spoke, and coach Cahill. Howie Lax, Editor Concordy, claimed though that Union's reputation as a hockey school will do us no good. Coach Harkness, after saying that he would have liked to have seen a separate report on hockey, went on to say that as far as Division I or II goes; it's only a number. The quality of play of the team 1S already Division · I calibre, so in effect \we are there\ already. Professor Finkelstein said that he sees in Harkness a great coach, but also as a threat to the values and philosophies of what college is all about, and what direction it should go in, in that hockey is something nonacademic and is getting more attention than the academic side of the college. Coach Cahill would like to see Union take first things first.He mentioned that Bowdoin was the Divsion II champ last year, yet they are not on our schedule. Also, we've never won the Division I I championship three years in a row before moving up to Division I Coach Cahill would like to see Uition take first things first. He mentioned that Bowdoin was the Division II champ last year, yet they are not on our schedule. Also, we've ne:ver won a Division ll crown ourselves (and the University of Vermont won the Division II championship three years 1n a 'row before moving up to Division I), so Cahill would like the school to take things slowly and in order.

CONCORDIEN_SIS Dutchman's Rathskell8r by PAUL CASTRATARO With the advent of th~ Dutch Hollow Pub to Union College last spring came considerable concern on the part of those in charge of the already established RathSI<ellar as to now the campus' only drinking hall was to withstand the effects of what a·ppeared to be . dangerous competition .. The Rathskellar had none of the atmosphere, none of the variety of facilities, none of the assortment of food and drink, and none of fhe ''class\ of the Dutch Hollow Pub, and was in danger of losing a large portion of Is the Skellar dead? Try to find yourself. Moribund? a clientele that had perhaps grown tired of beer and hamburger specials. It was understood ·that even if the possibility of st1,1dent preference for the Pub was ruled out,. the addition. of the Dutch Hollow Pub would perforce effect a smaller intake of funds by the Skellar because of a wider distribution of a fixed amount of money available to the Union community for .entertainment. These; coupled with t.he popularity of any new institution introduced to a college community .eager to try something new, did indeed result in a significant drof.l in the Skellar's sales last spring. TEMPORARY .LURCH . The financial lurch, however, proved to be but ternporary as the excitement over the novelty of the Pub began to wane at the end of the spring term; by the beginning of the faH term, the Skellar was received with much of its pre-Pub popularity, and had, in fact, regained a sizable portion of its losses. Furthermore, as Richard Siegal, manager of the Skella:r, pointed out, the Raths.K,ellar's record since the establishment of the Pu h h a s n o t b e e n unsatisfactory, in terms of what has always been its financial policy. The Skellar, according to Mr. Siegal, seeks merely to remain solvent, and is influenced in the m·ost limited sense by the pmfit motive. Therefore, the Skell_ar competes with the 'Pub only in view of preserving its autonomy and G>f remaining a service to the Union community. 1t is with these aims ill mind, then, that the Skellar continues to emphasize the sale of beer <1nd of hot dog and hamburger type foods, rather than the sale of mixed drinks and special dinner foods which have become the Pub's fare; for these reasons, too, the Skellar avoids holding specials on the Pub's special food nights. The Skellar realizes the essential difference between itself and the Pub; it knows it cannot hope to compete on the Pub~s semewhat more sophisticated level; and it uses the difference to its best advantage, and to the advantage of the ·,college~ HOW TO SURVIVE Given then that the acquisition Financial Aid Notices •{)f profits does indeed play a small part in the · .determination of Skellar policy, the .question might arise as to how the Skellar manage$ to survive in the event of a financial ·crisis like that' of last spring: How does the Skellar stay in business w.hen it has no reserve funds left over from previous profits? The Skellar is maintained and operated by SAGA, the mammoth food concession that runs the food service system at West Dining Hall: it is the This is the start of a new series of communication with · the college community regarding financial aid. The area of financial aid is complex, at times confusing, and certainly undergoing constant changes in one segment or another. It is felt that there is a need to expand on the intermittent articles · and announcements that have appeared in the . past in the various media on campus, into a regular, more informative and detailed treatment of the rriany facets of financial assistance. The objectives of the Student Aid Office and the Committee on Student Aid are to promote a greater understanding of financial aid in general and the College's philosophy, practices and procedures in assisting students through its · program. This expanded knowledge, it is hoped, will lay to rest some of the more persistent and unsubstantiated rumors surrounding the area of Flea Market Held The first Union College Flea Market-Book Sale-Bazaar was held last Tuesday afternoon in Carnegie Hall. It was a success for all those involved in it: both for those who got great buys on the great variety of things being sold, and for those clever enough to take advantage of an opportunity to make good money, selling their wares in_ a display of entrepreneurship rarely seen within the gray reaches of Schenectady. All manner of things were on sale: textbooks, posters, a large quantity of science fiction, handmade jewelry. paintings. hotplates, records, and all sorts of Stuff, including parachuting equipment and T-shirts with a genuine Lester Weiss masterpiece printed on them. Music was suppliedby WRUC, and there was free wine and cider as long as it lasted. Hopefully this first Flea Market gave members of the college community a feeling for the potential of future markets. It is a chance to l.eli your old textbooks - but it is much more than that. It is a chance to display the fruits of your talents - paintings, sculptures, leather- work, or whatever else you're into. It is a chance to unload some of the stuff that is cluttering your room and limiting your movement. It is a chance to sell whatever you can get a hold of. Keep all this in mind: due to the general success of the Flea Market and the interest shown in it, there will be more in the future. For those of you unfortunate enough to miss this first one, be thankful you will have another chance. Foil Term Abroad Interested in spending a ,t:rm in another country? Next fall Union offers you the opportunity of spending the term in France, England or Italy. Terms abroad are open to all students regardless of their major field of study and each term counts for two credits toward the fulfillment of Compre- hensive Education requirements.

An attempt will be made to avoid becoming too technical in these presentations. However, that is a real 'Challenge because financial aid, unfortunately, is not immune to the usage and proliferation of bureaucntise and acronyms. We'll try to minimize this when po~sible and . clarify technical terms when compelled to use them. The first step in understanding financial aid is the acceptance of the rationale, function and procedures of the College Scholarship Service (CSS), an adjunct of the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB). CSS is involved in the determination of financial need via the information provided on the Parents' Confidential Statement (PCS), which has to be filed each year in order to be considered for financial assistance. Union College was one of the original founders of the Colle.ge Scholarship Service in 1954 in response to the expressed need of post-secondary education institutions for a consistent and .equitable approach to the awarding of student financial aid. With the support and advice of the educational community~ the · CSS developed an objective, syste-matic · ·m.ethod for determining parents' ability to m~et ·educational ~~penses. Fundamental to the analysis used in the CSS system is the concept of financial need, which states that all financial assistance be awarded on the basis of a, demonstrated financial need as computed by the College Scholarship Service. The over 2000 schools that make up the College Board membership subscribe to this widely accepted · principle that enables the greatest number of students to begin and to continue their education.· Our next article will cover the theory of need analysis: Measuring Parental Ability to Pay. . Tjpii:al n)Oinen.t ,in s~~llar , I I • I ,· l ' ' \' responsibility of SAGA to either absorb the losses or receive the profits at the end of each .'ac~de~ic per.i_o,d ... Be.nea th SAGA's financial jurisdiction is the Rathskellar Board Corporation whose purpose is to survey the general climate of the Union community, and tnen to report its findings to the Skellar's managers, in the hope of mainta~omg solvency and of keeping SAGA interested in the Skellar as a practical investment. But. are we all so mercenary as to consider the 'value. of an entity such as the Skellar solely in terms of its financial feasibility? Isn't there a more basic and more important touchstone of the worth of an organization like the Skellar? As eloque_ntiy stated by Mr. Siegal, \If the only reason the Skellar isn't financially sound is that it has ceased to be needed by the Union student, then to keep it open would serve no purpose:\ Mr. Siegal said this with more than a note of optimism in his voice. He is aware that the Skellar has always been immensely popular with the Union student, and that the chances of such a dissolution are small. . A discussion with any of the students who frequent the Skellar would certainly attest to its popularity. The opinion of these veteran Skellar-goers was that the Pub and the Skellar play two entirely different roles in providing for the needs of the Union community: the Skellar is without a qoubt the place to go if one is looking for an informal atmosphere to meet with one's friends, to sit in casually unrestrained conversation, to be boisterous without feeling out of place, to loosen up and to relax, or just to put one's feet up. The Pub with all its \class\ cannot offer any of these. Rich Siegal defines the Skillar's appeal as a kind ·of rustic \charm;\ I would tend to explain it more as the result of the necessity something like the Skellar as a part of the Union Experience.

CON_q_Q_RDfENS!S, Wedne-!d~y. Jan. 12, 1977 Page5 arts Patti. Smith to Play Fri by Ira Goodman and Jeff Forman On New Year's Eve of 1977., 3800 people jammed New York City's Palladium_ to witness a performance by the field marshal of rock and roll: Patti Smith. The concert (which also featured John Cale) had the audience on their feet from the moment Patti and her band came on stage until they concluded their rousing encore two hours later. This Friday night at 9 p.m. in Memorial Chapel the Union College community will have the opportunity to experience what the Village Voice has called a \don't miss chapter in the continuing saga of Our Heroine's romance with rock stardom.\ Pa.tti's music, which addition to her sold-out performance at the Palladium, Patti has played to standing room only audiences at A very Fisher Hall, the Schaeffer Music Festival, and the Bottom Line ( 14 consecutive shows). Patti is excellently complemented by her band, which includes Lenny Kaye and (van Kral on guitar, Richard Sohl on keyboards, Leigh F oxx on bass, and Jay Dee Daugherty on drums. She will be preceded by John Cale, an excellent performer in his own right. Cale (along With Lou Reed} was one of the founding fathers of the Velvet Underground, the legendary originators of what is to~a~ known as punk rock. Cale's tough and expressive style is a prefect prelude to a Patti Smith concert. ln addition to his impressive qualifications as a musician, Cale also produced Patti Smith's first album. There are still tickets available in the Student Activities office in Carnegie Hall. This is the first major concert that the Social Committee has presented this year and it promises to deliver the type of excitement that has not been seen at Union College in years. cultur~ Patti Smith, queen of punk rock .incorporates her own poetry (of which there are ·three published works), creates a brand of rock and roll ·that is guaranteed to bring you to your feet. Her first album, Horses, was picked as the #2 album of 1975 by the New York Times ·behind Bruce Springsteen's Born To Run. (As is well known by now, in October of 1974, Springsteen performed in Memorial Chapel before he skyrocketed to superstardom). Her second album, Radio Ethiopia 9 has been critically acclaimed as a giant step forward for Patti, and demonstrates her potential to become .one of the giants of American music. In Top Ten Rock Reviewed by DAN ROSENBAUM There was so much good music made in 1976 that it began to overflow onto the Top 40 airwaves. It was very tough picking out the best ten of the year, so I'll put the honorable mentions first: Starcastle (Epic), a Yes sound-alike that will do fine until ' the originals regain their footing; AI Stewart, Year Of The Cat (janus), nicely textured rock fmm a consistent performer produced by Alan Parsons; . Ambrosia, Somewhere I've Never Travelled (20th Century), not as good as their first but plenty good, another Parsons project; Gordon Lightfoot, Summertime Dream (Warners), a durable performer comes through with what he does best; Billy Joel, Turostiles (Columbia), not as gootl as Piano Man, but then, what is? He's the John Denver of New York; Heart, Dreamboat Annie (mushroom), 1976's Cinderella story and Ann Wilson's V()ice is gorgeous. David Bromberg, How Late'll Ya Play •til? (Fantasy), a double set with an album of live music; great for fans and converts. Now for the 10 biggies: I. Stevie Wonder, Songs In The Key Of Life (Tamla). A pure joy to listen to though some cuts tend toward preachiness or repetition. People have been looking for the Beatles of the '70s. Here he is, Stevie Wonder. Truly an awesome j.ob. 2. AI DiMeola, Land Of The Midnight Sun (Columbia). As some of you may know, DiMeola was the guitarist for Return To Forever, in its last configuration. Although the others help out here, DiMeola shines with some impressive fireworks, as well as some mellow acoustic work. As it happens, the best cuts are those not written by him. This is not a rock album - it is decidedly jazz. Still, it's some of the best music of the year. Tom Akstens, coffee house performer 3. Michael Franks, The Art Of Tea (Warners) Who is this guy? I honestly don't know. All I know is that he wrote an album of songs that were performed live by Coffee House Hosts one of Joni Mitchell's backup bands. It is a delight. The overall sound is a happy, light jazz feel that's irresistible. Songs from this album have been recorded by Van Morrisom, Melissa Manchester, and the Manhatten Transfer. They must have liked it.

An MIT grad, he quit his job at Polaroid to be a rock and roller. All his spare money went into a basement recording studio and this album is the result. It's brilliance is precarious when parts of it threaten to turn into mindless AM rock or self-conscious tech- rock, but it always saves itself. Boston has learned well from the Who and Aero Smith. It is smoking, straight ahead mck. 6. The Pousette-Dart Band, The Pousette-Dart Band (Capito~. What happens when New York soft-rock meets Nashville production? Pousette-Dart is a happy answer. This album is a surprising and impressive debut. It runs the gamut of soft-rock style, without sounding artificial or derivative. Not that it doesn't get up and go, it just doesn't rock hard. Just as well. Irs fine the way it is. 7. S£eve Miller Band, Fly Like An Eagle (Capitol). Steve Miller has been around for as long as I can remember, but this is the first album that's gotten any recognition. It's about time. There isn't much on Eagle that misses. Still, it is something of a departure for Miller. The music is somewhat less bluesey, and the lyrics are more accessible than usual. An example: his previous album had a song called, \Shoo- Ba-Da-Doo-Ma-Ma-Ma-Ma\. This album has its deep-end lyrics, too. Listen closely to the lyrics of \Rock 'N' Me\ sometime. 8. Joe Walsh, You Can't Argue With A Sick Mind (ABC) I wasn't very impressed with Joe Walsh until I heard this unretouched live album. He's really something using a style that creates a kind of circular sound. It is biting, tense, and clipped. .. Turn To Stone\ is turned from a lethargic studio piece into a live, vibrant masterpiece. Boy, could the Eagles use him ... 9. Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Night Moves (Capitol). If there is any justice in the world, this is the album that will get Seger into the public limelight. After nin!! albums. it's about time. He is the only person to be a superstar in one state. In Detroit, he sells out left and right;, outside of Michigan, nothing.' Seger has only one semi-hit to his credit: \Katmandu\. But here, he has refined his wntmg and performing to a fine polish rivaling Springsteen. Fine stuff. lf this album doesn't go, Capitol's promotion people should be fired. It would be everyone's loss. 10. Peter Frampton, Frampton Comes Alive (A&M). I don't like this album. It is pablum rock. Still it's sold 6,000,000 copies in six months. Success like that is hard to criticize. How can I explain the sales of a double set recorded live. that have only previously released songs on it that didn't sell the first time? I can't. Neither can anyone else. That is why the album is so important. Record Execs , don't know why the album works. So, since they look for a trend, everyone from Seals & Crofts to Led Zeppelin put out a live set this year. I don't know if anyone else will have a monster hit with a live disc, but you can bet your bottom dollar everyone will try. So wraps up I 976, a seminal year for music, for sure.

Page8 J~!.l· 12, 1977,. CONCORDIENSIS Report Assessed After many months of waiting, the long overdue ·~Report of the Task Force on Athletics\ became public in mid-Decemh~r. Please Listen, Jimmy The last three parts of the report deal with subjects of little controversiality, and tile task force's recommendations clearly are favorable to the needs of the C()llege. There can be little deliberation over the need to strengthen both women's athletics and the campus' recreational facilities. Similarly, the report's suggestions with reference to the administration of the athletic department are not hotly debatable, and th.e President already has acted in accordance with the primary recommendation on this issue. Part two of the report speaks to the further development of intramural activities, another non-controversial issue. In this section, however, the task force recommended that .. Union again require all students to participate in a physical education program.\ This return to the P.asl is both regressive and unnecessary. Athletics play a role in everyone's life, but the degree of personal emphasis on physical activity should be determined by the individual. This is not an ancient Greek gymnasium, and the College's main concern always should emphasize the development and exercise of the mind, not the body. The establishment of a mandatory program poses the serious threat of the entrenchment of one more irrational and counter- productive requirement (a la camp. eds.) that will waste the time and money of students, while adding one more obstacle to the road toward graduation .. The main thrust of the report is the first section, and the issue, obviously, is hockey and NESCAC. The report recommended remaining in Division II for the former and retaining our affiliatien with the latter. We agree with and support the task force on both counts. We stand very little to gain from leaving NESCAC. True, many of the conference's rules are hypocritical and of questionable validity. The established guidelines, however, apply to all of the colleges involved. If Union cannot effectively recruit players, neither can its NESCAC rivals. As the report points out, \NESCAC has always represented more of a concept than a playing conference.\ The conference is prefaced upon a philosophy of academic as.cendency and athletic restraint, a viewpoint which Union reputedly adheres to. It is within the framework of this philosophy that the Union teams should compete. The College is in dire need of this external restraint. Regardless of the overtures of concerned faculty and students, there have been a number of incidents involving admissions, financial aid, grading, and other areas that point to highly questional;>le practices with reference to athletics. Even with the rigidity of the NESCAC rules, the warning of excesses are clear; without those restrictions, as haphazard and arbitrary as they may be, the NESCAC philosophy will be vioJated even more frequently and on a larger scale. Lastly, NESCAC is symbolic ot a tte that transcends athletics and embodiesanacademic'; alliance between Union and commensurate colleges. Again the r~port isolated this salient point: \Union. affiliated with NESCAC as much for academic (or, at least non-· athletic) reasons as to advance its athletic objectives.\ This loose- knit brotherhood is where Union academically belongs and athletically should remain. The real significance of the report, at this time, is the issue of hockey. Believing as we do that Union, above all else, is an academic institution, we think that to permit hockey to play Division I would be both detrimental to the College and in transgtession of the school's philosophy. Division I status would create tremendous disproportions in the athletic department program, open the dikes on a torrent of athletic excesses which already seem to be seeping into the College's structure, necessitate the granting of a functional carte blanche to the hockey program, and violate the dominance of academics. Division I play in any sport is totally anathema to the theory of education upon which Union is based. Athletics should subserviently follow academics, not walk by their side, let alone ahead of them. Union stands to gain very little of substance from Division I by Steven Lapidus The writer of this f,lrticle, Steven lApidus, has spent the last four months working in Washington D.C. for Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana. Jimmy Carter will be inaugurated as the 39th President of the United States on January 20. With his inauguration, a new · era in American .politics will commence. President-elect Carter, a peanut farmer from Georgia, unknown to most Americans only a short year ago, will become the leader of the most powerful nation in the Western world. With the actual inauguration, the most phenomenal rise to power in American .political history will be complete; Mr. Outside will become the inside that he tan against. Carter will become President in a most troubling time. While no immediate threat of war or depression exists, the new President will face a situation with a number of important problems whose time for solution is rapidly running out. He will be faced with a situation where if a number of problems are not solved soon, they might never be resolved and a serious crisis will become a reality. As American citizens we can only hope that the new President can accomplish the things that he promised during the campaign. Whether Democrat or Republican, Carter voter or not, it is our duty as Americans to give Carter our initial support. We must work our hardest to help him fulfill his promises, for the, obstacles faci.ng him are formidable. Mr. Carter promises to invigorate our faltering economy. He needs our support, the support of diverse groups such as labor, business, industry, agriculture, to break the binds of unacceptably high inflation, unemployment and deficits that threaten to destroy the fabric of our society. Our support is needed if he is to right the wrongs of an unfair and regressive welfare and tax system that hurts most those in the -least position to be hurt. He needs our help in unraveling the maze of confusion and waste knownasthe American bureaucracy. In these areas and others such as health policy, foreign policy, energy policy, Mr. Carter, as our President, deserves our help and support. Jimmy Carter comes to the Presidency at . a ti,me of great turmoil, Americans no longer believe in their government's ability to work for them, they no longer trust those in elected office, and in many cases they could not care what takes place there. We have been so warped by Presidents fighting wars we don't believe in, harassing and wiretapping private individuals, meddling in our li\es and lying, cheating and stealing that we have lost respect for the very fabric of the institution .. He has told us that he will heal our wounds and never lie to us. Let us hope he can remain truthful, but we must remember other Presidents saying the same thing. After all, - one recent occupant of the office told lis that he would bring us back together. Instead, he shattered us completely. . . . Washipgton l.s alive wjth ·the excitement surrounding the dawn of this new era. People are excited about the new Presidept. They sense the arrival perhaps ofa new age in American politics and history. They hope that Jimmy Carter means what he says. They , hope that he won't disappoint us as many of those before him have. They hope that he will heal our wounds because, to use a catch phrase of another era, we need it .. now more than ever.\ Jimmy Carter is corning to power in two weeks; all I can say is \We hope ... \ hockey. Visibility through athletics will not yield substantial institutional benefits. The College needs to attract students of a certain academic caliber. More likely than not, these students are not particularly interested in the quality of athletic teams. Any swelling in the applicant pool because of hockey would probably be the result of increased applications from students whose primary consideration is not academics.

Page8 Jan.12, 1977, CONCORDJENSIS C TV - Report Assessed After many months of waiting, the long overdue \Report of the Task Force on Athletics\ became public in mid-DecemhPr ., he last three parts of the report deal with subjects of little controversiality. and the task force's recommendations clearly are fa vorahle t0 the needs of the College. There can be little deliberation over the need to strengthen both women's athletics alld the campus' recreational facilities. Similarly, the report's suggestions with reference to the administration of the athletic department are not hotly debatable, and the President already has acted in accordance with the primary recommendation on this issue. Part two of the report speaks to the further development of intramural activities, another non-cotltroversial issue. ln this section, however, the task force recommended that \Union again require all students to participate in a physical education program.\ fhis return to the past is both regfessive and unnecessary. Athletics play a role in everyone's life, but the degree of personal emphasis on physical activity should be determined by the individual. This is not an ancient Greek gymnasium, and the College's main concern always should emphasize the development and exercise of the mind, not the body. The establishment of a mandatory program poses the serious threat of the entrenchment of ont:: more irrational and counter- productive requirement (a Ia comp. eds.) that will waste the time and money of students, while adding one more obstacle to the road toward graduation. The main thrust of the report is the first section, and the issue, obviously, is hockey and NESCAC. The report recommended remaining in Division II for the former and retaining our affiliation with the latter. We agree with and support the task force on both counts. We stand very little to gain from leaving NESCAC. True, many of the conference's rules are hypocritical and of questionable validity. The established guidelines, however, apply to all of the colleges involved. lf Union cannot effectively recruit players, neither can its NESCAC rivals. As the report points out, \NESCAC has always represented more of a concept than a playing conference.\ The conference is prefaced upon a philosophy of academic ascendency and athletic restraint, a viewpoint which Union reputedly adheres to. It is within the framework of this philosophy that the Union teams should compete. The College is in dire need of this external restraint. Regardless of the overtures of concerned faculty and students, there have been a number of incidents involving admissions, financial aid, grading, and other areas that point to highly questionable practices with reference to athletics. Even with the rigidity of the NESCAC rules, the warning of excesses are clear; without those restrictions, as haphazard and arbitrary as they may be, the NESC AC philosophy will be violated even more frequently and on a larger scale. Lastly, N ES CAC 1s symbolic ol a tie that transcends athletics and embodiesanacademic·: alliance between Union and commensurate colleges. Again the r~port isolated this salient point: \Union affiliated with N ESCAC as much for academic (or, at least non- athletic) reasons as to advance its athletic objectives.\ This loose- knit brotherhood is where Union academically belongs and athletically should remain. The real significance of the report, at this time, is the issue of hockey. Believing as we do that Union, above aH else, is an academic institution, we think that to permit hockey to play Division I would be both detrimental to the College and in transgression of the school's philosophy. Division I status would create tremendous disproportions in the athletic department program, open the dikes on a torrent of athletic excesses which already seem to be seeping into the College's structure, necessitate the granting of a functional carte blanche to the hockey program, and violate the dominance of academics. Division I play in any sport is totally anathema to the theory of education upon which Union is based. Athletics should subserviently follow academics, not walk by their side, let alone ahead of them. Union stands to gain very little of substance from Division I hockey. Visibility through athletics will not yield substantial institutional benefits. The College needs to attract students of a certain academic caliber. More likely than not, these students are not particularly interested in the quality of athletic teams. Any swelling in the applicant pool because of hockey would probably be the result of increased applications from students whose primary consideration is not academics. The real problem confronting Union is not in the numbers that apply, but in the number of accepted students that elect to come here. ·1 hose that are not accepting us are going to Williams, Amherst, Hamilton and other NESCAC schools. And the reason is academics and academic prestige, not athletics. Rather than trying to bolster Union's reputation through cosmetic surgeries, the campus community should aim at improving the school a~ an academic institution. People seem to be enamored with the idea of improving the school's image without improving the school. We are presently aspiring for a reputation of excellence without trying to reali1.e such excellence. I he only benefit of Division I play is better relations with the town and increased interest amongst alumni, and the concomitant product is money. Finances are not something that can be ignored, but when the College must put on a show to raise money, the theory of private education (and Union) is proven worthless and bankrupt (in all senses of the word). Being without any profe<;sional or highly visible college teams, it is only natural that the town loves hockey. The College, however, is here for the educational enlightenment of the students, not the entert[J inment of the townspeople. Alumni thrive and even seem parasitic upon sports. It is little wonder that no one bothers to work for the strengthening of the school when all the alumni seem to care about is a reputation on the sports page to boast of. lhe best interests of the College are served by remaining in 0Ivision Il hockey and highlighting the importance of academics over athletics. The College's priorities and commitments must be firmly hnkcd to academic accomplishments and excellence. Now, if a II t ho!>e who donate \for the good of the school\ would contribute to Umon\ sorely needed academic development, we might just be ahle to achieve a level of outstanding academics (and, hence, a dc,en cd academic reputation) and improve the entire school, not Jmt the hockey and athletic programs. Please Listen, Jimmy by Steven Lapidus The writer of this article, Steven Lapidus, has spent the last four months working in Washington D. C. for Representative Lee Hamilton oj Indiana. Jimmy Carter will be inaugurated as the 39th President of the United States on January 20. With his inauguratiol!l, a new · era in American politics will commence. President-elect Carter, a peanut farrnerfrom Georgia, unknown to most Americans only a short year ago, will become the leader of the most powerful nation in the Western world. With the act1:1al inauguration, the most phenomenal rise to power in American political history will be complete; tvt r. Outside will become the inside that he ran against. Carter will become President in a most troubling time. While no immediate threat of war or depression exists, the new President will face a situation with a number of important problems whose time for solution is rapidly running out. He will be faced with a situation where if a number of problems are not solved soon, they might never be resolved and a serious crisis will become a reality. As American citizens we can only hope that the new President can accomplish the things that he promised during the campaign. Whether Democrat or Republican, Carter voter or not, it is our duty as Americans to give Carter our initial support. We must work our hardest to help him fulfill his promises, for the. obstacles facing him are formidable. Mr. Carter promises to invigorate our faltering economy. He needs our support, the support of diverse groups such as labor, business, industry, agriculture, to break. the binds of unacceptably high inflation, unemployment and deficits that threaten to destroy the fabric of our society. Our support is needed if he is to right the wrongs of an unfair and regressive welfare and tax system that hurts most these in the least position to be hurt. He needs our help in unraveling the maze of confusion and waste known as the American bureaucracy. In these areas and others such as health policy, foreign policy, energy policy, Mr. Carter, as our President, deserves our help and support. Jimmy Carter comes to the Presidency at a time of great turmoil. Americans no longer believe in their government's ability to work for them, they no longer trust those in elected office, and in many cases they couid not care what takes place there. We have been so warped by Presidents fighting wars we don't believe in, harassing and wiretapping private individuals, meddling in our lives, and lying, cheating and stealing that we have lost respect for the very fabric of the institution .. He has told us that he will heal our wounds and never lie to us. Let us hope he can remain truthful, but we must remember other Presidents saying the same thing. After all, one recent occupant of the office told us that he would bring us back together. Instead, he shattered us completely. Washington is alive with the excitement surrounding the dawn of this new era. People are excited about the new President. They sense the arrival perhaps of a new age in American politics and history. They hope that Jimmy Carter means what he says. They , hope that he won't disappoint us as many of those before him have. They hope that he will heal our wounds because, to use a catch phrase of another era, we need it \now more than ever.\ Jimmy Carter is coming to power in two weeks; all I can say is \We hope ... \ The Farcical Comp Eds by MATT BRIEF This is another column ridiculing the Comprehensive Education system. No one likes to beat a dead horse, but the Comp. Ed.'s aren't dead, they're alive, silly, and pernicious as always. As a senior. I'm particularly sensitive to this as1mne requirement. Seniors somewhere around the end of fall term usually discover to their chagrin and dismay that their Comprehensive Education requirements have not been fulfilled. ·1 hey panic, look over courses like Metropolitan Land Use and try to petition their way out of the requirements. The word is out this year that the Associate Dean of Faculty's office will be very strict in granting waivers of Comp. Ed. requirements. Basically, what this means is that seniors will have to follow the inane guidelines set up under the {'omp. Ed. system. Let's assume that the purpose of the Comp. Ed.'s is to give the student a sampling of a well- rounded, liberal arts education. What remains t.ruly farcical and downright insulting to the dignity of a liberal arts .college are some of the schedules taken by students that are turned down for Comp. Ed. credit. Below are real-life examples of students who must take Comp. Ed.'s in addition to the courses they've already taken: An English major who's taken Physics and Calculus must take a Science Comp. Ed. to satisfy graduation requirements. A science major waits to see if he will get Comp. Ed. credit for Improvisation, a drama course, or if he will be forced to take an Option in Creativity. A student who has taken courses in English, History, Chemistry, and foreign languages is told that he must take Comp. Eds. to fulfill graduation requirements. Students who have taken various Psychology courses aren't given Science Comp. Ed. credit. They can, however, take \Psychological Concepts of Man and his Behavior,\ a psych Comp. Ed. for science credit. These examples point out the paradoxes of the entire Comp. Ed. system. Students who take the \real thing\ (i.e. physics, calculus, drama courses, psych) aren't given Comp. Ed. credit and are forced to take often watered- down courses given in the Co mpre hensi ve Education system. The point to remember is that students ought to be taking somewhat of a well-rounded education. Whether it's through Comp. Ed.'s or not is irrelevant. Time passes on, no one proposes a viable alternative to Comp. Ed.'s and students continue to have their schedules plagued by the system. There might be one solution to the entire imbroglio suspend Comp. Ed. requirements.

Page9 On The Firing of Joe Nyquist FRO·M THE PRESIDENT'S .DESK On November 19, just before Thanksgiving, the Regents of the State of New York voted 8 to 7 to fire a man of honor, competency, and decency in one of the most unusual spectacles .in the 200-year old history of the Regents. Ewald B. (Joe) Nyquist was fired as Commissioner of Education for reasons not yet made public. As he and his wife left for a holiday, he nevertheless urged his staff and colleagues \to be of good cheer.\ In truth, Nyquist was fired for a combination of longstanding political and personal reasons that had nothing to do with the performance of his office. The Governor bas disclaimed any responsibility, despite recent .public ~ttacks on Nyquist by members of the Governor's cabinet, yef the Chief Executive has not yet called for a public hearing by the Regents to air this unprecedented action. Like every Governor before him, he has resisted the constitutional independence of the Boar<J of Regents and now doubtless welcomes the spectacle of Nyquist's demise. Let no one mistake the importance of this action. The Regents have been weakened as an effective force in education for months and probably years to come. Why should Union College be concerned? Of what interest to Union students is it that the Commissioner has been deposed? First of all, this College is the oldest college chartered by the Regents and our fortunes have been inextricably intertwined with theirs since 1795. The first real commissioners of education who served the Regents were Union graduates. They helped establish the principle of the independence of the Regents from raw political pressure in order to protect education as the first priority of the State. In recent years, the Regents. have played an important role in developing a Master Plan for all higher education in the State and strongly pushed the programs of Direct Institutional (Bundy) Aid and Tuition Assistance, which have a direct financial impact on this College and its students. Now, the private colleges of New York must look for new sources of strength to protect and integrate them into the vast system of higher education in the State. New York alone has preserved a healthy and vigorous independent sector that continues to compete effectively with public colleges as in no .other state. The Regents have been largely responsible for the balance that has made possible the tenacity of colleges like Union in the face of competition of state-subsidized institutions. I have called for a public hearing to clear the air thatsurrounds the Regents' action. I believe strongly that the Regents' decision will not stand the light of day and should be reversed. I hope that thousands of citizens will join in forcing a resolution of this serious crisis. In particular, I hope that Union students will see their stake in an independent Board of Regents free of the taint of politics and injust,i.ce. qnlon college • , concor01ensts Editors-in-chief.. ................................................ howie lax, mike rotondi News editor ............................................................................. matt bnel Features editors ...................................... mirian david, andrea ccrttlrnan Culture editors .............................................. .fern flmnenhaft, joe millet Sports editors .................................... dann) wojnilo11er, deblnc polettu Copy editor .......................................................................... todd miller Business managers ...................... barbara stern, marla lux, harri; hal pert Classifieds editor ........................................................ martha rubenstem Subscriptions editor ..................................................... _ ..... harri; hal pert Layout editors ............................................. joe cappucio, nancy murphy Photography editors ............................................. steve gnll.

Gomberg ••• and In italy To the Editors: Here at Union College we are accustomed to getting an \education\ mostly in the classroom. Life is set around our classroom and our work because basically we came here to get an education. However; we also get an education as we grow and mature outside the classroom. This past fall I went to Italy on the term abroad program, and had a totally different learning experience. Instead of getting most of my education in the classroom I was able to get the best education. I've ever received out of the classroom. The education l got came more by everyday living and experiences I had. I realize at tlnion or at any otllet school ,~hat mal~tr. learn as . and\ meet - different people. However> f'Ol.l <:artn~t possibly Jearn ,as mueh f.rom experience and people you meet here, as compared to e~periences and people of a foreign nature. A person from Scarsdale ~an only have so many cultural and background differ~mtJes as compared to a .person from Woodmere. (I am sure you get my point.) The first great experi1::nce 1 had was living with my Italian family in Florence. When you are used to having such basic luxuries as water (cold for drinking, hot for showers), meat and enough food to fill your stomach, it comes as a shock when tbey are no l<mger there. 1t seems to me people don't have the impression that Italy is a very poor nation, but it is. The majority o.f the people there have little money and more or less live day to day. When I went to Italy 1 was not used to having to fiJI myself up with bottled water and bread after every dinner. It sure makes you appl\eciate things you have taken 'for granted all your life. By no . means is this a complaint of my life in Italy. Believe me it was great not having enough food sometimes, it really opens your eyes to things around you. After this you can really imagine how people in third world countries as well as the people in Harlem really live. When we had something resembling steak (which was about two or three times during the ten week span) it was a big deal, and you could see how those people real!y appreciate<! having it~ These kinds of things really make you think. The second great experience I had while I was away was coming into contact with people from all over the world. It really is a terrific feeling meeting a person who is from a foreign place and getting to know them. Because you. have so many things that are not common between the two of you in a way you then have something in cotnm'On that you want to find out as much about each other as possible. One night while travding in SwiU:erland, Jeff Foreman, Joel Sherman and I ran into an lsraeli guy about the same age. Immediately we became iivolved in a great conversation. It turned out this young Israeli hM led 6- paratroopers during the Yom Kippur War. He also mentioned that if he was in Israel · during the raid on Entebbe that he would have been sent on the mission. This young man's life was quite a bit different than ours. We learned how Israel rests everything on the shoulders of these young people; while in the US, at the same age, we really have very little responsibility. While living in Florence I took piano lessons from a 19 year old Italian girL As we talked more and more l found out she was a Communist and a firm believer in Mao. We totally disagreed right from the start mainly due to my ignorance. However, after she explained it to me and related Mao to Italy, it made at least some sense. We both learned a great deal from each others' viewpoints. Another fantastic experien<=e was meeting 4 Canadian girls while in Switzerland. This experience typifies how travellers enjoy meeting peop~e. We were taking each each other's names, lt was a . great-experience becomin$ sucn good friends in such a short period of time with such · total strangers. As you can see, the education 1 got while on the term abroad is something no one could get in the classroom.. Living in a different cultuFe and life style makes you realize how lucky we are. Meeting people who are different than you is the most fantastic experience one can have. I really recommend taking a term abroad somewhere. Sincerely, Peter Aron$on garnet pep c/o . tbe Editors: To the C.ampus Community~ This is·a special thank you to everyone who contributed in a number of ways to the success of Garnet Day and the. Pep Rally last term. It was especially gratifying to see the visible support of our faculty as they wore garnet during the day. Thank you also to all of the students who participated as members of their dorms and fraternities with cheers and · activities at the pep rally. The participation of the cheer- · leaders; the winter sports teams and their coaches; and the judges and the MC., added to the program. What was there was really good. but more people would only have made the program stronger. The next time you're looking for something to do - take the time to show your support for our winter sports teams - attend a men's or women•s basketball game; a swimming, wrestling. or indoor tra~k meet; or a men's or women's hockey game, Show all .of our athletes that you support the time and effort they contribute to our school. P{)sitive Action Group ptl on eo111p eds Tn the Editors: In an otherwise useful article on .. Intellectual Guts,\ Hope J. Fabian inaccurately reported in \The Campus Voice.. that Comp Ed was \totally\ the \creation\ of the faculty. In point of fact, many members of the faculty, including myself, consistently voted against the program. The majority of the faculty in the Social Science division, objecting to the painfully vague objectives of Comp Ed, did not support it. One important reason, if not the most important one, for the \creation\ of Comp Ed was the rather heavy-handed insistence on its adoption by Ted Lockwood, who was Provost of the college at that time. The new general education :program . should have two characteristics. First, it should introduce students to the salient features of civilization, past and present; second, it should be taught by Union's most effective teachers.

They're missing the experience. whole point of education. l really Concordy: You've commented a . would like to address that. few times that we're short on faculty. Would you 'like to see an improvement in the student- faculty ratio in a long term budgetary plan! Brownlee: Frankly, I would love to see it if it didn't eat into other needs such as faculty salaJies and so pn. Yes, 1 would love that above all else. Concorcly: Do you think independent studies should be encouraged? Brownlee: Yes. As long as the student . is mature enough to handle it. I wouldn't necessarily encourage it in very many Freshman students, but by Sophomore year, certainly Junior year, most students absolutely. Concordy: Have you observed a good deaJ of academic \pressure\ at Union;' i.e., aniount of work, competition, the gi'ad ·. school crunch? Brownlee: No more than at Rutgers. All students are going to feel that, it's the nature of us feeding thr·ough a narrow .Jtott~neck out into the workaday world of Graduation aHd good Grad schools. However, I would SilY · ac~ually there ,are .. some compen.sations. Th<~t ,is, r kp.o~ about the Calendar issue;\ but there are advantages to my mind for the three course at a time system. I know it'.s crammed into ten weeks which kind of compenSates a little bit. Concordy: Some schools have four course semesters. Brownlee: Yes they do. For four courses, they have four meetings a week. 15 weeks. Concordy: A few weeks ago at the Intellectual Cabaret, at I -\''!.\, • '• • • • ·• the College was discussed. It seemed like there were a lot of people saying, \I've been cheating, I know about .cheating and don't report it.\ Do you perceive a serious problem? Brownlee: I don't, but I fear there will probably always be some. At the moment, there's very little documentation of how serious it is. There are some people here who are very concerned. 1 think that we should make the whole question of academic integrity, why a Jcholarly community has to be honest should be addressed very carefully with incoming freshmen, any opportunity one gets a chance. I would like to say one th'ing that I am quite distressed about. I wonder what we should do about it. That is in what is I think a very nice campus where there's a lot of. attention paid to what the buildi.ngs ,and Concordy: Oo you encourage students to stand up when they know about cheating or have first hand knowledge? Brownlee: Yes, it takes great - ...-~~ \I think in most cases students are well-advised in their departments. \ moral courage. Concordy: The whole West Point situation. Brownl(!e: Yes. We the staff of the faculty have g9t to support the students in any way we know how when they have the guts to do that. Concordy: Do yon think professors on ..campus aa·e prone to flattery from students? Brownlee: Some. Sure, we're all human. Concordy: Have you heard about fac~lty biases for .or. agamst . blacks, women, frat brothers, Jews, athletes; any sort of prejudice either way? Brownlee: Pretty much as there would be in any population. Though I don't think that faculty members on the whole are all more open-minded and see their own prejudices if they exist and try to forget them wherever they can. I really myself hope that we can work towards making this college the real home for minority ·students that it should be so that they belong and are absorbed into the community as anybody else. Here, I have to say there are very few women faculty. Concordy: Do you think we need an increase in black and women faculty members to serve as role models, etc.? Brownlee: Yes, but with absolutely no loss in quality. Concordy: So you're not for quotas or Affirmative Action? Brownlee: Absolutely not. What we need to do is redouble our efforts in ·recruitin,g to find those qualified women and minoFity faculty. Concordy: But you're sure they're out there? Brownlee: I'm sure. I know they're out there. We have to find them and attract them and make it attractive here for them to come and stay. Concordy: Let's give a hypotlletical situation; a black candidate for a faculty post and a white candidate, or a woman and a male, who as far as all standards can be gauged, are equal and you'd say for educational purposes to take the woman or black. Brownlee: Yes. Of course in practice you never really get anybody who's truly equal. It's very complex. Concordy: Do you know of any instances where coaches of teams · have called up faeulty 'members fo speak to tllem about players on shouid· be absolutely fascinating. I' attract the very best students and the team for information or even don't know why they don't come be able to· retain them.

Concordy · So you wou~d~ t be m . . · . favor of lower admission or · missions but they are going to go where they can really be valuable. Like all of us, they only have so much time.

I m really ' not an expert; I don't really know more. What can i say but that one is never satisfied. The demands on Faculty here are intense, they are given a big load which may limit participation. Concordy: What have you thought of the student's extra- curricular contributions here? Brownlee: They're more active than Rutgers. Again, not active enough. It's different and I can't really ~ay. I certainly regret that for example, that you don't see 1 students at the excellent concert · series, and it's free. I think it's amazing we can ·do that series with· the Schenectady Muse 11m. When I look around, I can hardly spot any students there; they're missing such incredible opportunities, similarly the inaugural Garry Wills' lecture. Here, l'll say that I hope students · .Mme. ouUor· Pr<rl'essdi N.ichofs: .ft much about it, but I would doubt the Union College student body, which is. relatively small, could absorb even a moderate number of very different students. I don't know what \very different\ means and if that's really the case. If; in order to play a. Division l sport, we have to get in a very different student group then I don't think we're large enough to absorb it, say, as Harvard, Syracuse, or Cornell., Again, there is a very complex issue and I understand that it does bring community and alumni support of a different sort. Concordy: Do you t~ink it's important that our mean SAT's, particularly in our Verbals, are Concordy: How can UniOn go lower than most of the colleges about attracting students from we would . consider our regions where they traditionally competitors? haven't attracted high school Brownlee: First of all, I'd like to students? know if the data was really Brownlee: I have to admit that comparable.

Brownlee: As far as I can see, I think he's doing a fine job. Concordy: Do you think Jimmy· Carter will bring pubUc awareness to Union? Brownlee: 1 hope so. Concordy: U Carter couldn't speak here for commencement and you had to pick a man to somewhere else. i'he same certainly for Rutgers; they were always comparing themselves to Princeton. So there is a tendency to look for someone better. That's not bad as long as it's constructive. It would worry me terribly if students came to Union and felt \Gee I didn't make it into Brown or Harvard.\ Damn it, Union can offer things Harvard and Cornell absolutely cannot and that's the job of American higher education, the diversity Qf choice and quality, ,r· \Vandal ism has no place in what I known that you can always get more out of what you have. Let ·me put it this way with our opera·ting budget, we can probably do many of the things we want to do. We probably can't make a dramatic increase in the student-faculty ratio or expansion of the Arts without additional funds. Nevertheless, Union still has enough in the budget to do a very fine.job. There a,re strategies one can use to make a little money go a l.ong way: Keep your ear to the ground and your eyes watch what kinds of things you can get. Foundation support, like the Provost, has so very successfully gotten and I think the people on Planning and Priorities like to think of as a.n intellect_ual community. \ have tried to come up with this kind of strategy with the Internal Education Foundation, which is a ad~ress the Seniors, who would it be?

Report Goes On. Th.e Task Force also recommends that greater attention be given to women athletes, noting :that the status of women's athletics is \markedly lower\ than that of men's programs. Attempts should! be made, says the Task Force, to fill at least one of the two authorized fulltime women's coac.hing positions, with stress given to assurances that women have the same rights' to able coaches as men. A required physical education ·program for a:ll freshmen beginning with the class of 1981 is suggested by the Task Force. \We think physical education has a proper and valid role in the overall, 'total,' education of Union men and women,\ the Report says.

Jan. 12, 1977, CONCORDIENSIS Letters t.o the Editors cont. Continued from .,$ge ~ ·student and faculty; about \learning together;~' about the · ''process of discovery\ through interdisciplinary education, and the like. Emphasizing vague novelty fQr the sake of attracting the unsuspecting · student to Union, the .new . ~neral education progra:r;n will shy away from a rigorous definition .of what a college- . educated young person should know. My pessimistic prognosis is based on the lack .of student demand for a · structured education. 1 am delighted that students have at last been ,arouse<l to complain about the meaningless experience Comp ·Ed, as a general ellucation requirement, is and has always been, but what ab<lllt the future? What kind of general ed.ucation do you want? Do you think Union College student$ should be taught expository writing, history, and exposed to the ccmputer-- revolution of our .age, or do you think they shoul-d take a general education course entitled \\flies Have Dirtv Feet?\ • Concerned about grades, many, if n()t most, students will want a program full of \options\ and ''choices.\ Concerned about the image of .. the college and how we \project\ ourselves through the catalogue, many~ if not most, administrators will push for a pr-Q.gram that comes under the rubric of .. prl)gressive education\ (whatever that means), And the faculty, divided as ever and unable to agree on \'hat it is that students should learn in a general education program, will put its stamp of approval on a watere<l..,(iown version of whatever will be proposed. And then, five or ten years from now, when \Concordy\ will accurately call the general education program \Intellectual Guts,\ I will submit a letter to the editor, disclaiming responsibility for iL For I will not have voted for it and will therefore resent the char~ that it was my .. creation.\ Charles Gati Dept. of Political Sdence LET'S GET TO THE POINT! THE TRAVELERS We'd like to tell you more about The Travelers. Our College Relations Off.icer will be on your campus Jan.25 Please make an appoint- ment through your Place- ment Director. rink dekets To the Editors: Once again. the management of the ·Achilles Rink has initiated a policy which relegates the interest of students to a positi<>n of secondary to that of the general public. Like the initial ticket distribution policy of last year, the recent decision to require students to enter Achilles Rink through a single side d()or is inconsiderate and another example of poor planning by the management. While we are grateful for the attempt to expedite entry into the rink, the requirement of showing a college ID at the door serves only to unnecessarily delay the entry proced\tre. Furthermore, we do not recall any lengthy extra delays when all spectators entered the rin~ through the main doors. It is appalling to us that students should have to stand out in the bitter cold largely because of the above mentioned requirement which is already enforced at the time ·of securing tickets. This change. in entry prO\:etl~re, and particularly the requirement of · ID presentation, should be · reconsidered. Chilled· and Angere<i, Mike Rehr Jay Kasner thanks, mainteuanee To th'- Editors: Here at Union College one often hears a large number of complaints about a chosen group of college services and activities. One of these services is the Maintenance Department. I am writing to disagree. On the first Monday of this term l plugged in a lamp in my room. The lamp immediately smoked, fizzled, and caught fire. I dedded it was broken! (l am a pretty perceptive guy). I called · Maintenance at 3:00. Much to my surprise, it took not weeks or months for Maintenance to . respond, but 24 hours. By 3 the next day l bad a new lamp. (Boy, oh h<ly). So, at least I can no longer make fun of Maintenance. Sincerely, Bill J~t1kins You want a satisfying, challenging career. We need good college graduates with an interest in data processing and at least 9 computer science credits. Maybe we can get together. Consider some of these advantages: o Extensive EDP capabilities: applications expanding daily; most sophisticated equipment available; separate 5-acre Data Center. o Nationwide operations: more than 100 offices in all 50 states. o Opportunities for continuing education-reimbursement for job-related courses, courses leading to academic degrees or professional designations and excellent in-house educational facilities. o Dynamic business (has to be to keep up with constant changes in economic environment, computer revolution, emphasis on consumerism, and to maintain our position as one of the largest diversified financial institutions in the country.) o Rewards: good starting pay, ample room for advancement, wide insurance coverage (including dental), savings and investment plan, liberal pension, sick leave and vacations.

Please help me. \Desperate on Four Wheels\ Dear \Desperate\, It's obfuscative bombasts like you who give Union its bad name. Why don't you try being a bonfire at a pep rally? Dear Geek, I am a homosexual with a problem. I find more and more that women are what I really want. Even small farm animals do not whet my appetite anymore. I have great fear that I am going through that period (pardon the expression) when homosexuals have doubts. Doctors call this \hormone shift\.

UNION 12- BOSTON STATE 4 Kip Churchill was clearly the standout of Union's scoring rampage, tallying 5 goals for the evening in this rout of a weak Bo.ston State. His hattrick already established at 13: 16 of the first period, Churchill scored again at 0:09 of the second period and once more ten minuteS later. Dean Willers scored~ his first Union hatfrick, getting his third goal with only 14 .seconds left in the game. Mark Jenkins figured in all three of his .goals. UNION 9- OTTAWA 2 After looking.ratber impressive in· the early going, Ottawa's GGs slackened towar-ds the- end of the first period to .give. Union a· 3-0 lead. · Good hockey. prevailed through the second,, period· and the ·first half ofthe third until at 9:52 left to play, the . g!lme degenerated into a brawl. With his team behind 6-I, Ottawa'!! coach, distUrbed by a call, stood up on the side boards yelling at the referrees until he received a bench penalty for heaving a stick onto the ice. In the same stoppage a GG was charged with holding and Ottawa almost received a third penalty for refusing to take a second man off the ice. Just 19 seconds later Union scored a goal which was soon follQwed by a holding penalty and 10 minute misconduct for obscenely gesturing at the referees. Major fighting broke out at 12:09 which saw an Ottawa skater evicted from the game with a . police Goalie Baster sights puck UNION 14- McMASTER 3 .. · .escort as the rough play got out of control.

COLBY 1 26 s'hots and 5 goals into the net The Dutchmen, although opmton, was their sloppiest period of the season. The opening period was marred by sluggishness and a failure : to connect on . more than several passes, and Union couid not seem to get its offense to click. Despite this lack of usual sharpness, a 2-0 lead. was opened . by Bernie Kaminski and Chuck Pappas, who returned to the lineup after giving his ankle a one-game rest. Union came out strong in the second period, putting early pressure on Colby's net-tender. Pappas scored the lone goal of a period · which saw Steve Baker charged with 'highsticking while trying to force an opposing player out of the crease. Three more goals were tallied in the third period by Grant Judd, Brad Hinterberger, and finally by Doug Feasby on a pretty backhander. The shutout was spoiled at 9:41 when a screen shot . escaped Baker's glove. UNIO~ 8 - BRYANT 3 Coming off a two game slump, the Dutchmen broke the .game open in the second period With a pair of goals in nine seconds to take a lead they never relinquished in this victory over a surprisingly tough squad from Bryant College. Union was caught off guard. midway through the first period when Jim Grimm of the visiting Rhode Islanders fired a shot from the point which a screened J,im Baxter never saw, the fi~st shorthanded goal the Dutchmen have .allowed against them this season. Grant Judd tied the game at one apiece nine seconds into the second period but the tie was broken 46 seconds later as Union could not stop a two on one breakaway. Kip Churchill ended .his dty spell just 1'4 seconds later to tie the gall,le at 2-2 and at 16:29, with Union down a man, Brad Hinterb.erger intercepted . a . Bryant pass in center ice and let lo·ose a boome_r from just across the blue line in enemy territory which a tough Bob Fisette {57 saves) could not handle, Just nine- seconds later Judd scored again to give Union its second goal in the same Bryant powerplay. :54 seconds into the final period of play Dean Mathewson increased Union's lead with a goal from a Churchill feed. Tom O'Rear scored his. firsi career goal Brad Hinterberger aims goalward shot. The Dutchmen capped their scoring for the night when Doug Feasby came alive to score one goal at 12:09 and another at 12:46, both assisted by Dean Willers and Don Marshall. An unfortunate element in this game, which upped Union's record to 9- 0-1 was the reinj uring of his ankle by right-winger Chuch Pappas, who will be sidelined for several games. UNION 4 ...... BUFFALOS Last night, the Union College hockey team met their toughest competition of this season. In a hard fought contest, matked by exciting action throughout, the Dutchmen lost a very close game to tb.e University of Buffalo by a score of 5-4. The match was both tight checking and wide open with Union holding on to a 4-1 lead during' the exciting final period. After Buffalo scored the equalizer, Union lost a great opportunity when they failed to score during a third period power play while they held a two man advantage. In the waning moments Buffalo scored, giving them a one goal lead. With less than one minute remaining Coach~' Ned Harkness pulled goalie Steve B~ker and attacked with his six strongest guns but it was to no avail as the final buzzer sounded and Union was defeated for the first time this season.

Second, Union has not exactly been on fire so far this season. During their first 7 ballgames, they shot a frigid 35.6 percent. The sharp outside marksmanship of last season has yet to be in evidence. .Before a finger is pointed at anyone, though, keep in mind that no one man in particular can be blamed. The team as a whole has gone through a cold spell, and there is no Saturday night, Union was' outmanned by a superior Hartwick squad. l happened to have overheard one of the Hartwick players saying thai they were going to make up for previous years.

At halftime, Hartwick was favored by a 30-17 lead. The Warriors cleared their bench with 13 ~inutes left; their lead markedly mcreased and the score 48-19. Dana Gahres was the mailtstay by 30 points.

• '!1'. CONCORDIENSIS. Jan. 19, 1977 .Page 3 _Dowling Delineates Policy by K~N STONE As the new term begins, so too begins the first full term for the new Housing Pirector, Suzanne Dowling. In a recent interview, Ms. Dowling told Concorcfy about some of the current problems that have come to the attention of her office. Ms. Dowling is a recent graduate of the University of New Hampshire where she earned a B.S. in organizatiomd 'behavior. She then went to work as an administrative assistant for General Electric. However, she wanted to work in a college administration, and as a result, she foundherway to the Housing Office at Union College. In approaching problems that confront. her, Ms .. Dowling's goal is to settle them with fairness. Typifying this are her fe~lings against squatter's rights. . She believes that this policy is detrimental to the majority of students who do not reside in preferred housing. Because there will be no squatter's rights, next year, the lotterv this sorimz will have to accommodate· mainy mot:e stu- dents tha'n if!. the past. Ms. .Dowling will work closelY with the Housing Committee · to organize the lottery 1md . working_out something for Spring Term. Despite this problt:m, the Housing Office has received fewer complaints this year regarding West Dining Hall than in th~ past. Part of this is due to the recent painting and carpeting. (However, there have been a few complaints about the new color scheme.) MORE COED HOUSING? There have been stories on campus recently to the effect that there will be more coed housing on campus next year. Ms. Dowling confirmed that she is studying the issue with · the Housing Committee, yet she declined to speculate on any final decision. She told Concordy thl'J.t she will have offered hei ' own recommendations at yesterday's meeting of the Housing Committee at which point her opinions would be made public. One of the main reasons for considering any changes for next year, she stated, is that presently there are not any coed dorms with cooking facilities. However, she · emphasized that student opinion will wdgh heavily in the final decision. · · The Director of Housing's is also involved in the feels that this would set a bad precedent. However, she would . certainly consider a request for housing once they have become a functioning organization. Regarding the physical plant, the capital budget which is used for dormitory expenditures; is being cut by 84% next year. This-means-that money will have to be spent on priorities such as safety, before anything else. In addition, as carpeting wears out in the derms, it will be replaced by tile rather than new carpet. This is a result of the high maintenance and re.placement cost of carpet, which Ms. Dowling states, is an abused luxucy of the students. The Director a·lso · stated · t-hat dormitory prices would probably go up next year. Comp Eds: i•neither i:ompreh_imsive nor educational.'\' .

She Ayn Rand Discussed by BRUCE LUBER This is addressed to any Union CoJlege members who think they know who John Galt is. I am not only referring to that one- dimensional character in Ayn Rand's book, Atlas Shrugged - John Galt is also .an entirely diffetent approach to life. Perhaps an approach which could give mean-ing to humanity's gray existence. Or perhaps an approach better left in the pages of fantasy. Is selfishness a virtue? Does Ayn Rand have anything worth saying, or does she just exploit old romantic themes of power, glory, and passion? · On .Sunday, January 30 at 3 p.m. in Strauss Lounge, you are invited to discuss the merits of Ayq Rand's thoughts, or anything you feel is related to them.

This discussion is sponsored by the Positive Action Group. It will be the first of many covering a wide range of topics. These discussions originated in the feeling that Union life outside of the classroom provides very little in the way of mental stimulation.

Page4 CONCORDIENSJS, Jan 19, 1977 Employees' Attitudes Towards Students by WHIT KENNEDY In a small college like Union, there are a number of factors that contribute in formulating · the immediate · college ··atmosphere and environment. Usually the first factor that comes to one)s mind are tnc;: representation· pf students and faculty. It is· only natural for such a hroad image of a college to focus on these two factors, for they certainly work together to mold the basic cliaracter of the college. who generally keep the college grounds in healthy condition. T~ere is security, not the FB'l, wlto do a commendable job of ma·intaining order on campus regardless of the abuse they receive.

OPPOSITES From the two opposite extremes, the students have been the most vocal toward expressing any kind of sentiment in favor er against the functioning bodies of the college. Bluntly, it has been the employees Who are the brunt of the students' criticism and scornful sarcasm. We, who are part of the student body, must recollect that running the college does Il()t come trom tbe tiiihon of the student body, but from the work Qf employees a·s well, as enrollment of students. students year after year, it doesn't make it easy for the maids to feel for the students. But Mrs. B. Relyea said, \They like to see the kids come back every year, that's what it's all about.\ The two supervisors characterized the maids' opinion as. ''very concerned,\ \no problems at all\ and \they take things in stride ... The maids get a little bent-out of shape, but never complain.\ kids.\ Her only desire she confessed, is, \1 order for the kids to ,respect me, and I respect thet.:!l. You've . got to go halfway with them. Thes~ kids are not so bad, but they're full of the devil.\ CHANGE IN STUDENTS In s,pel!king wi.th Scotty Stewart, a maintenance workman, he presented a very sophisticated perception of students and how they have changed. He claims, ''In the last 3 years thete have been a lot of changes c in the student body; primarily, they· don't give us as much sarcasm. The students' attitude has shifted I 80 degrees What would students do without a security as covert as the CIA, SAGA serving dishes like the Ritz, and maintenance as successful as those \Watergate plumbers?\ In all sincerity, the employees of Union college deserve much more recognition than they currently receive.' Consequently, this article is aimed at givjng the college {:w.pmunity .•. aJ1-~d~a.,of hgw ~e!i-tain;:andomly­ . selected empJoyees feel toward the student body. Representing the college maintenance crew, Mr. Dick Mills, who is assistant director of the organization, comments on the student body. \The vast majority are nice people here for a serious purpose, and have respect for what most people work hard for ... The ones we tend to notice are the bad · ones, because they cause the problems.\ Mr.· Mills · emphasized that, \There :are· always a- few student-s every year with whom I have an enjoyable ·working ·r~lati(mship ... In the vast majority of cases here, they get away with a lot more than they would in the real world. I'm not sure if it's a bad idea ... It could be part of the learning experience: however, certain times it is allowed to get out of hand.\ MAIDS' VIEWS spoke with Mrs. B. Relyea and Mrs. Mary Gardner, who are maid supervisors, and they voiced. the opinion for all the dorm maids. \The general attitude is very happy; maids wouldn't be here for 20-30 years if they didn't like it.\ Mrs. B. Relyea declared that the kids had been very helpful, and in return the maids respond by inquiring about the ill stuclents' health... They feel like mothers.\ She said that a few students expect individual maid service but overall the students help out more than they impede. At times the students will come to their defense when the maid's boss gets on their case. For example, \Jeanette would not do anything good, hut her love for the students kept her on the job.\ With the constant turnover of SECURITY ABUSE Secqrity, who .get abuse from b9th sides, &tuderits an~ fa~ulty, had spme of the most l.'emar~able remarks a.bout the students.

It has become a game... Students are no different than they wete 25 or l 00 years ago ... If you can't get along with them, you don't belong in the job.'' Jannette Fennicks, the friendly lady who serves food behind the line at West college, has been an employee for 30 years. \I've had a lot of fun with those darn kids,\ she says, \the only trouble I've ever had was when one boy refused to be served b_y me. I said 'the black won't come ofr.\ She emphasized, \Students are always nice to me; even when I fight (hem they come back. Students are all my kids, tney are· a'll' fresh \In working in a girls room this fall, the girl was friendly, con:versationwise, whereas before, female students were usually timid and frightful of me.'; Scotty noted particularly, \I have gotten to know 12 or so students pretty well, and there is no longer that big spiel to get somewhere.\ Taking yet another angle of -opinion, I ,gpoke with Birdie Rod dis, who. is· a 1976 graduate of Union. She is a secretary if~> •.the ma:intenance office.·· Her general attitude of students was a bit different. She felt,_ \there is a minority, certainly I hope it is a minority, of students who give the majority of the student body a bad name. They've got a screw loose someplace... They are so used to having things done for them that they .expect a great deal.'' She presented an instance where some students expected maintenance to come down and paint their room. She confessed to be very perturbed by this and other acts of childishness by students. \The maintenance staff is on the whole very tolerant, more tolerant than me.\ . 1n retrospect, the pnme emphasis must be placed on the role that employees play in the College's ability to run smoothly. Employees always seem to be talked about in negative terms, never positively. However, they · have a high opinion of the student body and student/employee relations would be much better if students we~e as ·to-lerant as school workers. by J The So Union C exciting n which wil this aca<i Schneller, Sociology with Ter1 the point majers ne would pr cross-sec participati prior soc necessary.

CONCORDIENSIS. Jan. 19. 1977 Page5 Sociology Internships by JEJ:F FORMAN The Sociology Department of Union College is offering an exciting new internship program which will begin Spring term of this academic year. Professor Schnelle.,-, chairman of the Sociology Department, along with Terry Weiner, emphasizes the point that not .only Sociology majors need apply .. In fact, they would prefer to have a valid cross-section of s-tudents participating in this course. No prior sociology experience is necessary.· Wbat makes this program different from most internships is that this is actually a course, the basic idea of which Dr. Schneller has br-ought with him from Duke University. The course, Sociology 61, win be titled INTERNSHIP IN DELIVERY OF SOCIAL SERVICES. There are twenty- five positions available in a total of approximately twenty different placements .• · These include planned parenthood among others, some of which will be descdbed below. COURSE STRUCTURE The course structure. primarily revolves around . the work tb.e student will do in their particular · organization or agency. At the beginning of the term, . the class will meet once a week to talk about the social sciences and organizations to give a perspective and an analytical view of what is to be accomplished. The classroom format will give way, after a couple of . weeks, entirely to work in the organization, which could be approximately fifteen hours per week. The scheduling is decided entirely between the organization and the student. The only requirement is a report' on the internship; the structure of. the course is very open~ :rhere will be meetings at the end -of the term to get an overview of service delivery in the capital area but throughout the course both Dr. Schneller and . Terry Weiner will be available for any necessary assistance. The applications should be completed by February 7, and are available at the Sociology office in the Social ScieQ.ces building. The career and academic interests of the students will be considered in choosing tile interns; e.g. an economics major may be well suited for the internship dealing with budgetary problems at the United Fund. Importantly; if a student is already· wor_king with an organization and wishes to have it continue as an internship contact Dr. Schneller, with whom he .'she may talk about the possibility of a change. These internships w11l involve time at the top of the organization working with the director as well as in various parts of the agency: the students are expected to work ·but will not be exploited. internshiPs will involve time at the top of the org~nization working with the director as well as in various parts. of the agency: the students are expected to ~rk but will not be exploited. Dr. Schneller a:nd Terry Weiner will meet with all applicants at 8:30 P.M. on February 10 in the lounge of .the Social Science building to discuss various aspects of the caurse and tc:> describe the internships and to give people a chance to clarify aU questions they might have. A list of some ofthe sponsoring organizationScas well as a brief description of the nature of the internship follows. -HEAD START The Schenectady Communjty Head Start is an educational program for 3-4 year old children . whose families meet federal low income guidelines. The interns here should possess a strong interest in pre-school -children as well as a desire to work with the parents of tl:~ose chi'Jdren. The lnter-nsh·ips _ wiJl .. include educational assistants who will develop and make educational materials -for handicapped children and assisting parents in : making and using those materials with the children. A family assistant. is needed to help patents identify family needs and assist in · finding resources to meet these needs. A health assistant is needed to coordinate health · services to children. The Capital Area CommunitY. Health Plan will offer the area's . first pre-paid medical group -practice plan in early 1977. The only prerequisites for this internship are an interest in health 1 services as a future career. The: program is designed to provide an understanding of a new health delivery system by participation in its operation. Depending on the student's interest, guidelines may be shaped to allow an · exposure to certain areas of clinical operations where future career goals may be targeted. HUMAN SERVICES The Human Services Planning Council does social , welfare planning, public and private. They work in the areas of the . aged, criminal justice, family and individual services, health and rehabilitation, and youth and recreation. They are involved in legislation, in the recruitment, training, and placing of volunteers within the public and private human service system and in providing staff and volunteers training opportunities. Planned Parenthood of Schenectady is looking for a male student, not from Schenectady and not a Senior, who is out- going and willing to talk with groups of youn.g people; comfortable with birth control and sexuality as topics of discussion.The intern will work with the Stl,ldent advisory committee of the board of directors. He will develop and give school class presentations on family planning with a member of the educational staff. Possibly he will also work in the vasectomy ' clinic and in the contraceptive clinic and have the opportunity to ·observe tlte workiqgs of all aspects of the agency and its three branch clinics. These are only four of the possible twenty internships available and there are complete lists available in both the library and the Sociology office. It must be stressed that there are no .prerequisites for this internship and that it is linked to a course. If you have any questions please inquire at the Sociology office, R.oom 215 of the Social Science \-uild ing. The cluttered halls of trivia. Sorority born to Campus by CAMMY LAPENTINA Union College, the mother of fraternities, is experiencing a new kind of birth pains; a sorority is about to be born. Interest for a sorority arose during the fall term of this year among a group of girls living in Richmond. The girls approached Dean Smith on the subject, and he assured them that, to his knowledge, there was no ·existing legislation prohibiting the formation of such organizations, as many people have erroneously believed. Judy Rosenberg and Liz Yager, the sophomore women who head the effort for the sisterhood organization, explained their involvement in a phone interview with Concor-diensis. They see the creation of a sorority as a way to add not only to the social life of women at Union, but also as an orgamzation which would be able to fight causes that they feel would better the school as a whole. Nancy Smith, the group's advisor, and a member of the Dennison chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma, feels that the entire school will benefit from a formal women's organization. She sees the negative aspects associated with sororities as being unlikely to develop. There will be no . pressure for women to join; rather, as Ms. Smith hopes, it will provide an open opportunity for all those students who are interested. During the fall term, the group held an open meeting to inform people of their activities and to measure campus interest. Roughly 45 people attended, Spring-Plantings SPRI~G PLANTINGS Dr. William Huntley, .chairman of the Campus Planning Board, has been working steadily behind the scenes · to help keep the campus beautiful. The target area for this spring's plantings is the hockey rink, which desperately needs sorne greenery. The plan calls for a ring of Quen;us p-alustris, the pin oak, to surround most of the rink, and a variety of shrubs and small trees to spruce up the front entrance. In addition, the walks, ramps, and curbs will be reorganized, and thick oak rails will line the walks to guide the hockey fan up the oft' icy walk. This plan also includes some pines to cover the interesting, but unattractive, heating plant. Preliminary estimates show the plan will cost approximately. $16,000. As yet, Professor Huntely has obtained $5,000 from the alumni council, and trustee Bill Vanneck is matching with money from • the Baily fund, whatever Huntley can raise. Also, Sigma Phi has shown interest in providing .a handsome thousand dollars. Exact plans are being drawn up now, and Professor Huntley assures us the project will be completed late this spring.

This term the women have been in contact with National Sororities, learning of the various .options they 'have in establishing a national chapter here at Union. Rosenberg sees the addition of sororities as one more step towards making women an integral part of the college community; it will provide a center for women alumni to return to, and strengthen communication ties between the female alumni and the college.

The Theory of Need Analysis: Measuring Parental Ability To Pay The primary purpose of fil'lan~Jial aid programs is to permit attendance at post- secondary institutions by students who cannot afford the expenses themselves. The need analysis system of CSS is designed to serve a national standard of objective measurement of ability to pay for higher ·education. The CSS system. is based on several assumption!!, and its levels of expectation are related to current economic concepts and the best available evidence of parental al:>ility to pay for a college education. I. Parents have an obligation to pay for the education of their children to the extent that they .a~ able to do .so. 2. Family income is the first and primary source of support for education. >: ·IS'Jf·tookS ···to Expand by JUAN ENRIQUE TORO home-away-from-home capacity. ln case you are interested in adding any fine touches, stop by on Saturday at 3:30 and lend your local support. One concrete plan is to co-sponsor a dance with the Black Student A~iiance (BSA) on Saturday Jan. 29. The lSA will be supplying the beer and manpower to help out. With the combined effort of these two organizations the dance promises to be excellent! 3. Accumulated ~s~ets-equity on a home, savings acco,unts and investments~must also be considered. The treatment of . assets in the need analysis system · is very mt1ch tnisu!ilderstood.- Assets are indicative of some financial strength in the family, although most assets, such as home equity, do not possess a ready conversion to \liqui<:)hy;\. consequently, only a small portion of the total assets in a family (f2% ). are .conv.er~eQ to income · in , determining finally : the parents'· contribution. Allowances are made from assets for retirement income and this allowance will vary deperrding up_on the age of the wage earner. 4. An objective syste.in of financial need analysis must treat all families equitably~ recognizing the peculiarities of each family's situation to the greatest extent possible. It can recognize only expenses that are not a matter of family choice Allowances are ~ ' ~ for the number in the. family, num6er 1n college,. (!:lP to $1,500 is deducted from income for a motlter's expenses such as lunch, carfare, babysitting, etc. if the mother is working), any unusual medical or dental expenses, and other obligatory expenditures, such as the payment of taxes, basic support· for family members, losses due: to theft, and costs from accident or catastrophe. All of these eA.penditures must also be considered beyond the choice of the f~mily. 5, CSS uses the concept of ''available income\ in its procedl,ltes for calculating ,parental .cgntri_!)ution: Available income is defined as ihat income avcillable to the- family after ·au the allowances mentioned in ( 4A) are taken into account. · 6. The final portion of the CSS rationale for determining the amount parents can reasonably be expected to cont·r'ibute concerns the 'adjl.l.sted available income\ of the family. A.djusted ·available income is the available income plus the supplementary income derived from converting·the assets in (3). A. Adjusted available income reflects the economic strength of the family resulting from a combination of its income and assets. The parents' contribution toward education expenses is ·derived from this amount from the Parents' Contribution Table which shows contributions of zero at the lower rung of the. income scale to contributidns that can cover the complete college co~ts. Our next article will discuss \The Theory ·of Need Analysis: Measuring Student Resources.\ Not many students recognize the name International Students Organization (ISA). This is due mainly for two reasons: 1) Our activities have been centralized around international parties and 2) our · active membership is limited to foreign students. Although the latter lends our club a sense of unity we are trying to expand our club to include more of the Union Cpilege conimunity. The original pur.pose of the ISA was to provide a plac~ . ·for students sharing ·a similar experience to meet and get to know one another. The common Ex-American Returns Home • experince is living in the United States. There are forty undergraduate students from all over the world here at Union and for most. it is their first time in the U. S. The club has been successful in umtmg these stud·ents, and we are fortunate in maintaining close ties with the international students of other colleges in the area. Our present objective is to attract more of the Union campus community. The ISA is not only for foreign students; in fact, some of our more active members are U. S. citizens. · James Veneris sp.eaks f1u\nt English. He . was born in the United.

Mr. Veneris has lived in the People's Republic of China for the past 23 years, and the influence this has made on his life and philosophy was evident in his lecture last Wednesday night. If a Chinese who has adopted American culture is a Chinese-American and the converse applies, then Jim Veneris is in every way an American-Chinese.

He and a friend surrendered themselves to a Chinese guard and were greeted with kindness, told \We Chinese People's Volunteers have a policy towards prisoners. We don't ill- treat captives. When the war is over we will return you to your loved ones.\ Veneris recalls how the Chinese gave all the prisoners clothing, food, and medical care and allowed them to write home. He remembers a young Gl who· was unable to read or write who was educated by his captors. The Chinese also allowed freedom of worship, celebration of holidays, and set up an inter- camp olympics. The guards constantly renumerated, \The American PEOPLE are a great people. They are a peace loving people.\ As Veneris says, \It's a damn crime that stuff wasn't told to the U.S. or people in America.'' Wa:r Ends When the war ended the prisoners were allowed the right . to read the peace agreement and go anywhere they wanted to. When Veneris and 21 other American and British soldies and officers decided to go to China they were denounced as cowards and traitors and their back pay was cancelled.

He cold have stayed in Peking but decided to return to Chengyang where his friends were. Jim Veneris remarried upon his return to China and now has a wife and 4 children there.He spent a considerable pa,rt of the lecture describing his daily life at home. He gets up at 5:30 in the morning, jogs, eats breakfast, and goes to work around 7:15. He noted the difference between aU. S. factory and his, noting that in China there are no gates; no guards, and no timeclocks. Work ends at 3:30 and if there were no problems during the day which have to be discussed, the workers can leave.

He has since travelled throughout the country, visiting friends and speaking to · people. He claims that despite the technological advancements, the nature of the American people has not changed much in 23 years. Although their level of domestic and international political consciousness has expanded, the people are still a . warm people. But with all good there has to be some bad and he sees an increase in crime, vice. and use of drugs. But as the U. S. has taken care of itself in the past he thinks we will find a solution to our problems in the near future. Before taking a break after which many of the 50 plus members of the audience returned, James Veneris made two comments which he said he want~d to be sure everyone understood. ··u is my duty\ to warn you, he said, of the collision course the that U. S. and the USSR are heading on. He asked that everyone be careful not to let the two most powerful countries in the world get out of control and trigger off a third world war. Secondly, he repeated that the American ,people and the Chinese people are great peoples and that they would live in peace forever. Those who attended the lecture realized they were listening to a Chinese visitor and not a r~turning American.

The raspy, tough, greaser type voice is hauntingly reminiscent of a more famous . greaser from Asbury Park, New Jersey. Add to this a Mick Jaggerish British twang, that changes the world chambermaid to \chime~ermayed\ and you have a vocalist that gives the impression that he wants to jump out of your speakers and let you know that he really believes in what he sings. for good measure. · Parker's lyrics deal with familiar topics: love, past, . present, and future, but mostly past failures. For example, from the cut Black Honey, \I wish we never parted ./ 1 wish we had a choice I cause now I roam these bitter lands I a face without a voice.\ The lyrics . are not especially profound, but that's · mostly because · they are pale compared to Parker;s voice and the !tumour's stormy backing.

That makes 156 hours on the air per week out of a possible 168. This is the first ttme that WRUC has gone all night on a regular basis since they began broadcasting on. the FM band in May, 1975. Then, . they broadcasted only in the afternoon and evening hours. The next fall saw a gradual expansion of broadcast hours mto the morning hours as competent staff became avatlable. 'RUC has never ventured past the 2 a.m. sign-off before. The expansion of programrmng makes a greater diversity possible. Now, 6 hours of disco are scheduled per week, on Satur~ay night, from 5 to 8 p.m., and fr<>m 2 to 5 a:m. Also, jazz is played every weekday afternoon from 2 until 5.

England abolisfied the death penalty was because an innocent semi-retarded many was executed for the crimes that the infamous lady kiUer John Christie had committed. Alas, if we can rid ourselves of social miscreants like Gilmore, the sacrifice of an innocent man once-in-a-while isn't to.o bad . Perhaps now the \Gilmore\ hysteria might end. No more sick jokes or skits in the dorms or on television or radio sho,ws. In H.ale House on Monday several students found iuruly difficult to believe that Gilmore was really executed. The sick joke was given his punchline by five Utah gunmen. Next week, another murderer is to be put to death in Texas. Maybe another one the week after that, and then again a month after that. The names will be anonymous, . not worthy of · mention in the media. Perhaps we'U become . inured to the concept of society killing its own.

In the last ten years alone over 1268 major shade trees, 2892 smaller trees, 2391 shrubs, and 7537 plants were planted on the campus. Many of our trees are very young, and as time goes by, they grow in size L ri in beauty. · ..,d now 1977. We have a new ho · rink, barren, surrounded by 1 ~n dirt. Not much of the Achille~ gift was left over for attending the appearance of the outside of the rink. Plans were drawn by the Saratoga Associates (who do much of the planning on campus - more than committee members!), and fund were needed. Well, guess who had to approach the reluctant alumni council, the Trustees, the provost again? The main question is, should Union College have to depend on one person's efforts to raise the money for the beautification of the campus? Isn't it about time that the Campus Committee (or the Campus Planning Board if you want to get into bureaucratic titles) had a yearly budget of its own to help maintain and improve the aesthetic appeal of the campus to students, and to applicants, to everyone? Of course, large projects will still require major donations, but there will always be small areas that the committee would love to improve. Surely, the beauty of the campus should be a primary concern of the administration and the Committee on Planning and Problems. ..

A commission appointed by Governor Carey to help determine the future of higher education in New York State took testimony from college officials, students, and the general public. As President of the ltost college, I had the chance to testify on the important role that Union has played in collegiate education in the state. For nearly 200 years Union College has been the birthplace of movements for public support and coordination of higher education in New York. This was the first college founded after New York became a state and the first chartered under the state's Board of Regents. Our initial support came through donations of the citizens of Schenectady, and, in that sense, we were the first ''community college\ in the state. Union was also instrumental in promoting the growth of state support for higher education in the .form of land grants and a famous state lottery operated by Eliphalet Nott in behalf of Union and Columbia Colleges, then the only colleges in New York. The College even issued currency based on income from the state and other sources. It opened its doors to students barred from admission at Harvard, Yale, and other eastern schools. It supplied the graduates who became the first presidents of the great public universities in Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, and more than 80· other pioneering colleges .. ft thought of itself always as a public college serving a public mission in behalf of the people of this state and beyond. Thro~-~:ghout, roo~t of the state~s l,tistory ,the indepen!;lept.colleges , . · were the public's colleges. Indeed, until the 1960's, the majority of young people in college in New York were enrolled in independent colleges. This alteration was the product of the introduction ,o'f massive public monies into the state, city, and community college 'systems. Even after the growth of the government-sponsored colleges and universities, it became clear that they did not always serve the public any more widely or effectively, often enrolled fewer minority students, and cost about as much to operate as most \\\' private colleges. But the tuition gap between public and independent colleges has grown by leaps and bounds. While the public sector, now including the City University, has been given greatly increased state tax support to offset rising costs, the independent ~chools have had to rely overwhelmingly on tuition increases. Though costs are roughly the same, the pric.;e of attending an equally efficient independent school is escalating out of reach. Only the Bundy aid program of direct support to private colleges and the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) have spoken directly to the differences in educational pricing between private and public schools. At Union College the Bundy aid provides less than 5 per cent of our annual operating budget, but that represents $300 additional tuition that we have not had to charge. Even more helpful to students is the'Tuition Assistance Program for New York State residents of modest means. It is clear from State Education Department studies that TAP does, in fact, significantly influence decisions made by· our students. The grants not only provide many students at Union and elsewhere with the opportunity to attend college, but greatly expand the students' ability to choose among colleges. According to the Department's figures, nearly one-half of TAP recipients at private colleges would not have attended the same institution without an award. It is, therefore, the position of Union College and the Commission of Independent Colleges and Universities (ClCU) that future public policy in the state should look to increased TAP and Bundy support in order to prevent further growth in the \tuition gap\ and to stabilize enrollments in the private and public sectors of higher educ:ttion. Looking ahead five to ten years, the position of CICU is that the combination of TAP and Bundy aid should reach a third of the costs of educating a student in an independent college in order to accomplish these aims. Hence, the importance of the hearing and state policy to Union's fut\Jre. The College is now represented on the Executive Committee of CICU and on a new organization of trustees called Committees of Correspondence. Even mor~ importantly to Union students. we are now a member of the Independent Student Association and are represented on the board of that student ~roup. All of us have a stake in th~ P!ograms being developed by CICU, and I am particularly glad that students have become involved. 1 hese programs pl~ty an important part in our planning and !>tratcg) for Union's future, as 'We seek to hold tuition charges down. \\hile Stfll providing ~he highest quality of academicand student program~.

-. To the Editors: In his letter to last week's Coneordy (commenting.. on CompEd), historian-prophet qtJarles Gati lays out a two- decade career for himself as pessimist and na,y-s~yer. For those concerned with general education beyond Gati's own excellent department, the attitude is pretty disceuraging. The easy way to be a sure prophet is to forecast doom and decay in any human endeavor. Plan as we will, time and entropy will have their way with us. And in matters of curticuhxm, ten years may be about the cycle, I'd say. But thcinevitable need for change, for rebuilding, surely can't be a reason for not building, as carefully as We cart, in the first place. If Gati were given a wholly free hand in designing a pattern of general education (if, indeed he really believes in it at all), his scheme too would suffer the same fate in time. Need he be dismayed at that? It's even easier to forecast doom if you can help in bringing it about. First, issue . dire predictions of failure; then refuse to help for ten years, sniping all the way; and finally say \I told you so\ at the collapse. That's an infallible way of bl;:ing right An easy way. This letter is not a defense of the CompEd program, nor a defense of any other pattern of general education. I too think ifs time for rebuilding ~gain, and some sense of history tells me how it will go. We'll be: .partly foolish again • .and partly wise again- of course. We'U hope for a little too much, and settle for a little too little - of course. Some of us will be naively optimistic, and some of us will sullenly drag our feet - O'f course. Should a good p-olitical scientist expect : anything else from human efforts to order human affairs? What Gati brings us is not news but an attitude - a damaging and wearisome attitude, I think. Of course CotnpEd has had its failings. Of course it's titne for a change. But just as ·Of course, Comp Ed has had its successes, too; and both its successes and failures are qualified with complications too subtle to be handled by the rhetoric of a Gati or a Brief. As we see the program in its waning days, we are understandably more attentive to its failings; but those of us with longer memories ought to know, surely, that CompEd moved our education here into some new paths that were sorely needed. If those paths have now become ruts; if it has become rigid and even (as Matt Brief says) \farcical\ sometimes, then it's time to find other paths and ways. But not, I hope, a return to the same ruts we lifted ourselves - out of when we laid out the trails of CompEd in the beginning. .Blame? ihere's plenty to go around for all of us. Some narrow-minded students, some equally narrow and foot- dragging faculty, some unsuppl)rtive administrators too satisfied with \image\ and too careless of much else. Even when the motives were pure (as they usuully were), we managed, as human beings do, to tarnish our own dreams by lethargy and egotism and myopia. Sure: aU of us can share in all of that. No news there. The whole story of the \failure\ of CompEd, seen in a decent perspective, has yet to be written, and this is not the place for that. M<:anwhile, what we see in Concordiensls is only the Brief ridicule ~ sometimes Justified, sometimes not of any system's anomalies. Meanwhile; as the -scapegoats are sacrificed, I await . more positive letters. What, then, should general education try to do and be? But that would be another, and longer, letter. For now, I speak only of !tn attitude, and my hope fo'r a change in that attitude. It's altogether too easy to carp cynically about the past, expect nothing in the present, and promise more letters five or ten years hence _ c_OJJ.y>laining of failuresthatthe letter~writer mrriselr nerp~cr to· bring about. That's .prophesy~ on-the-cheap. All of us, including Mr. Gati, deserve something more intelligent than that. Sincerely, - Alan Nelson Devartment of EngliSh hoekey team•-rue To the Editors: We feel compelled to write this letter as a result of the broadcast of the Union hockey game of last Tuesday, January t l, against the University of Buffalo. ·. Tn begin with, we feel that a broadcaster's job is to present an accurate account of the game as it occurs. We are not finding fault with the broadcast in this instance. But, the comments made after the third period of the Buffaln game, when Union had lost 5~ 4, made us ·realize many remarks which we would like to comment upon. We feel that comments stating that the team will now realize that they are not \invincible\ and they they are not the \crea:tn of the crop\ are · not indicative of supportive announcers. We are not saying a constructive criticism summarizing the game is not useful, but we feel in this case. the remarks were sneering and vengeful, characteristic of people who have negative feelings towards the team. Just like any function in this school, the hockey team is a segment of Union College and needs support. lt is not easy to maintain the position they have been assigned to, and it is about time the broadcasters, for one, and the rest of the Union College community, also began to realize this fact. To compound this situation, other events have also been made known to us by reliable but unrevealable respurce0 which add to our anger. Firstly, it has been said that after Union lost to Buffalo there was laughing going on at the WRUC studio. All we can ask is, \What kind of sickening reaction is this'?\ Maybe these .peQple are jealous of the talented hockey players, or, some other explanation may be found, but is it necessary to have such biased people represent Union College on the air? Secondly, once agaih, there was said to be laughing by the WRUC announcers when a Waterloo player, in the home game of January 15> was injured in the third period. As befor¢, reasons fort}.)i$ type of· behavior may be hypothesized, but, it seems to certainly characteri:z,e people who are not fit to be ,in a position of representing our campus. To end, we would like to say tha.t if certain individuals who are working at WRUC cannot contain their personal negative feelings towards.._ the team while they are representing the school, then they should res~gn. Also, we feel that the hockey team deserves some credit and respect because they are talented people who work hard to maintain their winning record. It is not fair that so many people here are determined to prevent them fmm achieving success, make them unhappy, and make everything so hard for them. When will some people on this , campus realize that a variety of talents is art asset for enrichment of a college community and that respect for those different talents must be recognized. And most of all, just remember that everyone has feelings! Sincerely, Cyndy Pearce Janie Schuster Dennis Brown numbers eleared r () the editors! Consistent _ With . my fall cam.paign 'to get· more members of our community to read the college ,,rules and regulations as confained in our catalogue, and in response to a report in your last issue, i write to point out that one member (not eight members} of .last year's hockey team made the Dean's list. This honor, also achieved l>y 250 other members of the class of 1979, was awarded according to criteria listed on p. 76 of last year's catalogue.

Page 12 CONCORDIENSIS, Jan. 19, 1977 Concordy INTERVIEW with An interview with Professor Hugh Allen Wilson, Chairman of the Arts Department by Nancy Murphy Com:ordy: Could you give us a frank appraisal of 'Union's arts program right now, both its strong and weak points? Wilson: Sure, its very strong points are the quality of the faculty. And a potential weakness is the lack of breadth, as we see, in relationship to the way in which we'd like to expand the simply to take care of the students that we have, because. of the fact that we have far more students applying for places in out courses than we c~:>uld conceivably take. Of course, if there is a substantial increase in our program, we must be very aware of what that student-faculty ratio is, because we would certainly, in any plans we make for the future, expand the nature of the ·program itself, by the gradual bringing in of new programs, new pregrams for y,.hich the students are clamoring. For instance, a well- integrated program in Him, in dance, and bJinging in professional musJctans, find a new set of alumni supporters for the arts, indeed. In fact, I have information going back a few years that would indicate that. Reports have gotten back to me that alumni would prefer ~o reserve their fundings for the growth of the arts and increase the facilities for the arts. I should think that .there are a great many people ar.ound who have gone out of Union who would be very interested in funding the arts program here. Concordy: What about the possibility of national grants for the arts? Wilson: Well. we're aU awaiting come from. And as far as I'm concerned, this is secondary. I think that the primary thing is that the College must become aware that unless Union does make an administrative and collegiate commitment to the arts, they will continue to stay away from being what we consider a genuine libefal a<rts institution. And I think that when I say \I I am reflecting the thinking of my department. And I think that this will have a considerable amount to do with some problems of the breadth of. our student body. Now I'm sure this is not priv.ileged information, but I was talking to Jay Shupe Concordy: Do yo~ a~re~ ln general with most of the findings of tlae report? Wilson: Yes, I think we· did, yes. Concordy: As a member of the All-College Senate~ do y9u find tl!_is a sympathetic body towards the arts? · Wilson: Well, by feeling, yes. But, no deCisions have been asked for in relationship to the arts aj this particular point, so that so far as giving any official position of the ·Senate, I would say that they have taken no position. 1 am sure that they are supportive in general of the Report of the professional performers, who will do something else besides their performance duties. They would also teach other courses, which would allow us perhaps to cycle in a different way than we do now. Concordy: Do you think that student government has been supportive enough -of an increased arts program? u ••• the College must become.aware that unless Union does make an administrative, and collegiate committment to the arts, they will continue to stay away from being what we consider a genuine liberal arts institution.,, program. Also, we're turnmg down as many students eve-ry term as we take, simply because tile demand is far greater than the faculty can manage. Wilson: The student government, and the student forum especially, has been very active in their support of the prog~am with their initiation of the symposium and their continuing interest. They are certainly continuing to keep in contact with me and with the Provost and convey information back and forth. Concordy: Are there any particular trustees perhaps supporting the arts program? Wilson: Well, I think that Bill for that marvelous Union graduate J i111my Carter to see what he is going to do in relationship to the arts. And of course, there is this new tax bill, or proposal, that is J think in the House of Representati-ves at the moment, which will permit Americans on their income tax returns to indicate monies that they wish to be put towards the arts. And polls have been made throughout the United States on this, and apparently there is a .considerable amount of the population who would not object to giving from one to five dollars simply at the time of their income tax hallucination, or whatever it But We do have a magnificently strong faculty. For instance, Bittleman, Rosenblum and L. Weinberg would be welcomed on any arts faculty in the country. And· modesty forbids me to go -any farther than that.

Concordy: One thing that they proposed in the Visiting Committee Report was to have a separate division for the arts, eq~al i~ status to the humanities .

What we'n: doing here, it seems develop our faculty, and develop the students who are comii1g io Union wha will have an interest in the arts, and keep these in balance with ou.r plans for a building, so that, at so!r_!e point in uThen there is also the matter of morality or ethics; that is, can we be a liberal arts institution, and call ourselves one, and not have the Fine Arts and the Humanities .at the center of the curriculum?\ ..._.,.._-- .......... ~. to me, is what S() many other institutions, larger and smaUer, ate doing. In our attention to the sciences, we are .preparing people specifically for jobs that may not evenbe there in. ten years. And I feel that certainly with the Union students that I know and know well, who do exceedingly well, there _ i_s . a _ . certain lack of. resilience, a certain im1bility to go out of here, very .particularly trained, and meet up with a situation where there is no job for which they have been trained; they suddenly find that they are unable to do anything else. One of the things we might be doing is . preparing our students to do no thing, not nothing, but \no thing,\ but to do it very well, which theq.t gives them some ch~nce ofadapting fr.om having a tremendous breadth of background and of sensitivity to the world. . . . And you know, there is this correlation of mind between the applied sciences and the arts. The creativity that is required of b<!~l!,. and :the . intuitions a-nd. sensitivity : l\ •• -; ''~ _,,.. ' • • . j. ; -~.. t • 'the future, we don't find ourselves with a building that we have either too many people for or not enough for. Concordy: Could you cite some other schools somewhat comparable to Union, and compare out arts program with theirs? Wilson: Right off hand, I don't know of one college of Union's size, excellence ·and potential breadth who has such minimal arts facilities as Union does. To look at schools around us, it's very hard to ~et one that corresponds. Well, take Dartmouth, Williams, Amherst, or Skidmore. For instance, RPI. They are putting forth a tremendous effort to, as it were, \humanize\ its engineering and scientific students. And they're far ahead of us in some respects. Concordy: Without extra funds right now, do you see any way to enhance the arts program within its. own·· ~dgetary constraints? · u Right off hand; I don't know of one college of Union's size, excellence and potential breadth who has such, minimal art~ fa_cilities as U1_1ion does.\ is nurtured by an · Interplay between these two areas. For instance, I would like nothing better in this department, so far as the music is concerned, than.to see a required math course for all art ma:jors. There is that kind of a· logical 'phis intuitive way into the . mystenes of nutn&ers that does ' develop types of sensitivities, but without the fine arts as the counterpart to that, the division is one-sided and even lopsided. Concordy: Do you ea,vision a new arts center in an expansion of · the arts? Wilson: If there is to be an extension of the arts department. we've. got to go somewhere~ we have nowhere to go at the moment. I feel very strongly, and we've said this repeatedly, that to · u •••• ·w~ can design, we have designed repeatedly I may add, and give the admin:istra t ion vision· of what our the arts program here should be in. the year 1990/' have an arts center just sort of spfirt?.YJ?i- ~~qw,li~e ·~!?J?,S~~);VO~J~> be ndiculous. What we nave to do is to develop our programs, Wilson: None. We're operating like every body else, on a very · tight budget. And there are some general considerations being talked of throughout the college, for instance, of setting up funds to bring more people throughout aU the disciplines onto the ~Cirtlpus, and to make it possible for members of this faculty to participate on other campuses rnuch more than they have. Concordy: Do you have any feelings about establishing an arts manager to coordinate the different interests in the .arts? Wilson: Yes, we do, yes. ·rhel'e are lots of way's of ro'okirig. at' lt. We can do it in terms of getting an administrative dean, who. is aho something else, for instance, an art hil:itorian. The iqeal situ~tion probably would he to have two people, one ofwijomvas essentially a manager to take care of the business end of this .rather large operation, which requjres a great deal of publicity · work, bringing together the vast number of prqgrams that are under the aegis of the department of the arts. You see, these, in a way, take away vast ~mounts of time of the faculty members, that is, the administration of these, not the teaching of them, not the . ~cademic overseeing qf them. So the ideal situation would be to have an ar.t historian who could ·be an academic dean of the department. and then, in addition to that have a sort of arts manager. Short of that, to get an art historian or a te11ching dean who could also handle some of this would be a second solution. A t.hird .. solution would be to bring in a person .as secretary of .the department who w·ould have a much expanded seope over what our present very excellent secretary has. Concordy: Has the arts department requested someone for this _position yet? . Wilson: Oh. it's been proposed by the department, yes. The first reaction to it was an either-or sort of thi~~· one or the other; We 1 ' One. of the thzngs we migftt be doing is preparing out {Union) students to do no thing, not nothing, but ~no thing,' but to do it very well, which then gives them some chance of adapting, from having a tremendous breadth of background and of _ Sl!rzsitiv~ty to the world.\ And that's where we are now. We can simply tread water foreve·r until a decision is made by the college as to what they have d,ecid~d tl,l,e funct~o~, of tl).e fi11e <Jrts. is to. b~. ·.its. jipportance.; And ·of course, l'.ve also given you our · concensus of thinking as to what Union will be with. it and what Union will be without it.

But the problems are of a different magnitude. For instance, we can design, we have designed repeatedly I may add, and give to the administration our vision of what the arts program here should be in t~e year 1990. Well, this is. fine, they can etther , say yes or they i:an say no.

Garnet H oopsters Continue Downslide by LANCE BOBROW The Union Dutchmen are off to their slowest start in quite some tir:ne wit~ a 1-6 record, their only wm commg at the expense of a Middlebury squad by a scoFe of 63-55. There are several reasons for this slow start and they aFe worth delving into. First of all, Union lost their forwards due to graduation as well as star guard John Denio. In addition, center Roger Symonnette is no longer with us although it became apparent that his style of play did not mesh with the Union attack. ln a nutshell, Union has lost a large portion of its team from last year. Second, Union has not exactly been on fire so far this season. During their first 7 ballgames, they shot a frigid 35.6 percent. The sharp outside marksmanship of last season has yet to be in evidence. Before a finger is pointed at anyone, though, keep in mind that no one man in particular can be blamed. The team as a whole has gone through a cold spell, and there is no mystical superstar to spark the team and relieve the slump. Another problem concerns flexibility. As previously pointed out, Union is just not the same ballclub it was last year, so coach Scanlon has had to go with young ballplayers to round out his squad. Last year, Scanlon had the luxury of a Pete Meola or a Mark Rekucki coming off the bench. This year, they are starting, although right now Rekucki is shelved with all injurv .... Saturday night, Union was outmanned by a superior Hartwick squad. I happened to have overheard one of the Hartwick players saying that they were going to make up for previous years. Union came into this ballgame with a 5-game win streak over Hartwick. The outcome here was never ill doubt as Hartwick raced to early leads of 15-6 and 24-10. At halftime, Hartwick was favored by a 30-17 lead. The Warriors cleared their bench with 13 minutes left; their lead markedly increased and the score 48-19. Dana Gahres was the mainstay for Hartwick; he scored 18 points on 9 of II, shooting many of these long distance shots of the 'facial' variety. On the Union side of the ledger, AI Walker led a lethargic Union offense with 13 points and 9 rebounds. Three of Union's starters did not score. The team shot 15 for 45 and this is not the way to win ballgames. Coach Scanlon tried his patient offense at first and still managed to lose by 30 points. No motion has been seen yet in the Union offense and it is hard to imagine Union getting beaten by any more than it has been. Union will journey to Williams to play the arch-rival Ephmen this Saturday. Williams is not one of . the better teams Union has played this season, and it will be interesting to note what changes will be made to give some gas to the sputtering Union attack. You can. tune in to the game at 7:55 over WRUC, or better yet, take a drive up to Williamstown and enjoy the game.

Page !6 CONCORDieNSIS, Jan. 19, 1977 Six-Year Bio-Med Program, con't. Doug Henning: - . Continued from Page 1 anticipated (as compared to a ratio of 2: I for regular admissions). The first announcements of acceptances will be received toward the heginning of February. Attractive Option Besides being a very attractive option to the superior student interested in pursuing a medical career in fewer than normal calendar years. the six-year rued- program should prove to be an important asset to Union College too. By its very nature the program will undoubtedly be much sought after by academically capable students who perhaps would not have otherwise considered Union as a possibility, thereby giving Union a better reputation in science~ related fields. Mr. Schupe hopes that this will in turn create an awareness of Union \across disciplinary lines,\ attracting non- pre-med students of higher caliber who have heard of the excellence of the Union pre-med program. Dr. Roth. though stressing the premature nature of such speculation, sees the virtue of the p.rogram not only in terms of offering another outstanding option to the prospective student, but also as a mean~ of bringing to the attention of the generalpublic how fine an institution- Union really is. Another asset of the program to Union College is the creation 0~ upperclass vacancies for qualified transfers after the transfer of the pre-med undergraduates to Albany. Aibany Approached Union As a point of interest, it shoUld be noted that Albany Medical College aproached Union and requested that it take part in the program - not the other way around. For nearly a decade RPI and Albany have maintained a program similar to the one Union is instituting this year, with nearly 40 students enrolled arid with the emphasis primarily on bio- medical engineering. But Albany felt the need of a somewhat stronger liberal arts orientation and of a greater sensitivity in the areas of the Humanities and Social Sciences. As Dr. Roth expalined, \It is very desirable for the medical profession to produce physicians whose backgrounds are more varied.\ For this reason, Albany has reduced the number of six-year pre-med students to 20 and has given the other twenty positions to Union. It must be stressed, as Jay Schupe did when interviewed, that the real commitment involved here is on the part of Union College: the student is under no obligation,. either legal or moral, to continue with the program should he find it too strenuous. His options are quite flexible: he may transfer into the regular Union pre-med program; he may continue with the program for as long as two years Student Forum Meeting, comments from the audience. Only two issues were challenged; namely, the proposed creation of a Director of Women's Programs post and the recommendation to remain in NESCAC. A Union co-ed voiced disapproval of the planned creation of a Director of Women's Programs post. She warned that such a position would establish an \administrative separateness\ within the department. She felt that this recommendation would set the groundwork for continu\'d differentiation between .men's and women's athletics here at Union. Why is such a post necessary for women when a similar post does not exist for men'? Supporters of the report argued that, at this stage, women's athletics are Indeed different from men's and that the new women's post would facilitate the movement towards equality. At a time when the women's program here is being built up, the ability Student Forum Meeting - Thursday, January 20, 1977, Davidson Lounge, 7:30.

Some students felt that the women's post would help fill the inherent administrative void. On the NESCAC issue, the students present were unquestionably dissatisfied with the league as it .stands now. They were split, however, with regard to whether or not we_ should abandon it. Those in favor of terminating our association with NESCAC cited the league's rules against post-season competition and recruiting. They proposed that the league is stifling our hockey program, which has the potential to develop at an exceptional level. Those students supporting the proposal contended that leaving NESCAC would do more harm than good. Without a viable alternative, such as a new league, they felt that the move would be unwise.

In support of this, the case of Norwich College was cited. Norwich is a school which is presently unattached to a league and is finding it literally impossible to set up full schedules for some of its teams. Jim Trump added that it is understood that no N ESCAC schools would play us if we left the league. No other objections were raised concerning the report's recommendations. There was some support offered for the recommendations concernmg increasing the .maintenance budget and for the relocation of the football field. After the meeting had broken up, Forum members expressed disappointment at the turnout. Due to the limited response of the student body, neigher the student representatives nor the trustees could get the kind of consensus they had desired. As a result. the students will ret·urn to the various governing bodies without the strength of student sentiment to support them.

But Albany felt the need of a somewhat stronger libera,J arts orientation and of a greater sensitivity in the areas of ~he Humanities and Social Sciences. As Dr. Roth expalined, \It is very desirable for the medical profession to produce physicians whose backgrounds are more varied.\ For this reason, Albany has redwced the number of six-year pre-med students to 20 and has given the other twenty positions to Union. It must be stressed, as Jay Schupe did when interviewed, that the real commitment involved here is on the part of Union College: the student is under no obligation,, either legal or moral, to continue with the program should he find it too strenuous. His options are quite flexible: he may transfer into the regular Union pre-med program; he may continue with the program for as long as two years Student Forulll Meeting, comments from the audience. Only two issues were challenged; namely, the proposed creation of a Director of Women's Programs post and the recommendation to remain in NESCAC. A Union co-ed voiced disapproval of the planned creation of a Director of Women's Programs post. She warned that such a position would establish an \administrative separateness\ within the department. She felt that this recommendation would set the groundwork for continued differentiation between .men's and women's athletics here at Union. Why is such a post necessary for women when a similar post does not exist for men'! Supporters of the report argued that, at this stage, women's athletics are indeed different from men's and that the new women's post would facilitate the movement towards equality. At a time when the women's program here is being built up, the ability Student J<'orum Meeting - Thursday, January 20, 1977, Davidson Lounge, 7:30. Student Forum Meeting Thursday.

Some students felt that the women's post would help fill the inherent administrative void. On the NESCAC issue, the students present were unquestionably dissatisfied with the league as it stands now. They were split, however, with regard to whether or not we should abandon it. Those in favor of terminating our association with NESCAC cited the league's rules against post-season competition and recruiting. They proposed that the league is stifling our hockey program, which has the potential to develop at an exceptional level. Those students supporting the proposal contended that leaving NESCAC would do more harm than good. Without a viable alternative, such as a new league, they felt that the move would be unw1se.

WALTER hockey) would be unable to maintain their schedules at the present leveL In support of this, the case of Norwich College was cited. Norwich is a school which is presently unattached to a league and is finding it literally impossible to set up full schedules for some of its teams. Jim Trump added that it is understood that no NESCAC schools would play us if we left the league. No other objections were raised concerning the report's recommendations. There was some support offered for the recommendations concerning increasing the .maintenance budget and for the relocation of the football field. After the meeting had broken up, Forum members expressed disappointment at the turnout. Due to the limited response of the student body, neigher the student representatives nor the trustees could get the kind of consensus they had desired. As a result, the students will return to the various governing bodies without the strength of student sentiment to support them.

Its importance in providing leisure time activities is complemented by the fact that . it brings people with common 'interests together.

The stu&nt cent-er on ~he third flo~r of security system, as most facilities of this nature should have, and it . >1s7rom tiifs negligence that I believe the problem derives. In the most precise and concise terms possible, I will clarify the dilemma; it is related to a specific numerical problem. i.e. the changina of the total · number of books in the library in an uncontrolled and felonious manner. You see. -each night bnoks are believed to be smuggled into the library through knapsacks, . pocketbooks, ·. und·erneath swgaters and there is even . evid;ence of an· undergr-ound network of black~market book dealer$ tJUt to thwart the . ~ it i -~ 1 ~ there . are so many m~w volumes to t.lOOtend with tha~ possibly they· have become lost in the shuffle.

My faith in the student body of this college is. considerably higher than this, and it is for this reason ! search for the Mr. Big whom 1 am certain must be behind this mystery. This problem is not a new oue; in fact, the late Dr. Tolan,· past head of the library. was quite aware of it Each year he had a standing bill in the Budget and Priorities Committee to p~r~has~ · an electronic sec'urjty' sy,stem for this library and each year it had been refused. In conjunction with an officer of this college, whom I shall call Dean; a fellow student, whom I shall call Otto; did research · into the cost and efficiency of this type of system at the librafY- of Hofstra University. The pri~;e, $19,999, is sub- stantially less expensive than that of replacing . missing volumes (obviously now existing in duplicate), but for some reason this proposal bas been continuously r-ebuked. It is for this reason l am· convinced that the total number of volumes must be increasing rather than decreasing. If the school was actually being robbed of so many expensive articles, I am quite sure they would quickly take action. But, if, as l believe, the number is increasing, this would explain their complacentness and willingness to spen._d such vast amounts of it\bney to continuously reorganize the existing or remaining volumes. Whatever the cause, the problem remains, more money is spent in maintaining th.e · level of competence of this library than would be needed to install a security device which would do the same, and possibly allow for the improvement of ·what is not · one of the better libraries on a co.llegiate level. And sir, if you thlnk me mad, question any student who has searched for a book. only to find out from the librarian it has neither been remrived officially nor is it occupying its ordinary location. It is, as we say ~n the sleuth vernacuJar, MISSING lN ACTION. - Sincerely, Jeff Forman

During the first portion, the relative dearth of anticipated sex scenes incited the predominantly male crowd to suggest alternative plots su~h as, ·\OK now gang bang her\ or \Stick that picket sign up her\ or ••come on, rape her.\ But later when a woman, evert in a dream, (or was it) had the audacity to restrain a group · of men with a rope, shoQt a man with a shotgun, and then apply a knife to his genitals, a cry of sympathetic reaction arose from the crowd. Obviously the same group of people think that women enjoy rapf,! and other forms of subjection to violence but men do not. If you agree, then ask another person who is a woman and then ask yourself again. Sincerely, l<od Aldrieh martin luther kin~ To tbe Editors: It will be recalled that the College Senate voted last spring to commemorate each year the birthday of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In accordance with the Senate's action, President Bonner appointed the undersigned to chair an ad hoc committee to plan an ~ppropriate celebration. The committee decided fhat Dr. King's birthday this year should be marked by a major convocation which would be addressed by a speaker who had been distinguished by his or her position of leadership in the civil rights movement. After some discussion, we chose from a long list of names about a half dozen and the chairman, along with Profes$or William J. Daniels, was charged with making the arrangements to bring one of these speakers to Union during the weeks before or after Dr. King's birthday on January 15, Letters of invitation were sent out over President Bonner's signature and a suitable budget to provide for a substantial ho·n ora ri um wa.s made available by Dr. Bonner. Although our first overtures were made to a potent·ial speaker late last spring, and our efforts persisted until the past week, I regret to say that we havefailed. Neither of the two best pr(>spects as speakers, the Reverend Jesse Jackson and Bayard Rustin, both truly outstanding figures in the movement for racial justice and equal rights and~ closely identified with Martin Luthet King, Jr., were able to arrange their schedules to permit a visit. to Union. Several other people who were ,approached, including UN Ambassador- designate Andrew Y otmg, also regretfully declined our invitation. We do not wish to let the birthday of Dr. King pass unnoticed on this campus because it should remind us that the great work he did is far from finished. May I urge each member of the Union College community to commemorate the occasion by · giving thought to what he or she can do to continue Martin Luther King's struggle to eradicate discrimination based on race, religion, W:tijon~lity or sex, and to advance the cause of human rights. Martin Lichterman, Distinguished Professor of History and Higher Education pa-tti s1nith To tbe Editors: Is the Union College Social Committee serving the students or the townies? Although the Patti Smith concert was sold out, there seemed to be a disturbing absence of Union College students at the concert. It appears obvious that the Social Committee has lost touch with the tastes and wishes of the students it is supposed to serve. The majority of students I've talked to seem to feel this way. Rumors have floated around that for the same price of Patti Smith, we could have had Commander Cody here or for $500 more, Jimmy Cliff. I don't know about the truth of these rumors, but surely there are more talented and broader~ appealing acts to students than Patti Smith within her price range. Besides wasting our Student Tax money on a hyped~up, obscene anduntahmted, dime- a--do;zen punk rock act, the Social C01nmittee also brought a sideshow of the weirdest townies I have ever seen. As a townie myself, l have never seen a weirder and more obnoxious. crowd at a concert in Schenec.tady or any other place. The catering to townie tastes is a dangerous precedent for the Social Committee to take. After all, this is our campus,. not theirs. All 1 can say is, wake up Social Committee and do your job right! Sincerely, Rudolph Lu, '77 ·game reotu To tile Editors: Recreation is an imp.ortant facet of any college community. Its importance itt providing leisure time activities is complemented by the fact that it brings people with common interests together. To fulfill this basic requirement, adequate facilities ate essential. . Unfortunately; Union CoU~ge is failing_ to p.rovide adequate facilitiel! in certain areas. lhe student center on the third floor of Carnegie Hall immediately comes to mind as a case in point. This archaic facility now provides the Union student with the use of two billiard tables, a ping pong table and an AM-FM radio. During the holiday recess a foosball' table, a pinball machine and an •_elecjronic' game machine were removed from the center. Jf the meager facilities do11't convince you that then; is a problem, go up there some Friday night to shoot a game of billiards. if you. arrive after 8 p.m., the door will .be locked. The Student Center is dosed Friday and Saturday nights <turing prime recreational hours. If you do manage to visit during open hours, you will probably find a gang of 13 or l4*year old adolescents monopolizing both pool · tables. At present, children of staff are all()wed to use the facilities. I have no complaint with this, but the situation often gets out of hand. The . one employee's child will bring in 10 of his friends and consequently the Union student .who has paid the- $30 activity fee will have to wait as long as an hour to play one .game of pool. Something must be done to improve this recreational facility (a euphemism); it must be renovated, the hours must be changed, and stricter controls must be observed on the use of the area. I urge you to take an active interest in this problem as well as other recreational problems within the Union community. Sincerely, Jim Loree librar~· erusade • c/o The Editors: Dear Mr. Holmes: I am directing this correspondence to you with the belief that your expertise is needed to deny the diabolical scheme I have uncovered from persisting in its p.resent course. I am an undergraduate student at Union College in Schenectady and for three years have been suspicious of evil goings on in the Shaeffer Library on said campus. Many people in various administrative levels . of this hierarchical organization are astutely aware of the problem and yet fail to take proper action to remedy the situation. I will briefly outline the situation supplying the necessary details and background with the hope you will kindly offer your highly sought-after services to this institution. The library in question has two entrance (and exit) doors through which there is totally free access during most hours of the day. There is neither a security guard nor a modern security system, as most facilities of this nature should have, and it ; is from Uiis negligence that 1 believe the problem derives. In the most precise and concise terms possible, I will clarify the dilemma: it is related to a specific numerical problem, i.e. the changing of the total number of books in the library in an uncontrolled and felonious manner. You see, each night books are believed to be smuggled into the library through knapsacks, pocketbooks, underneath sweaters and there is even evidence of an underground network of black~market book dealers out to thwart the academic progress of this . institution. · · · There has i.)een debate as to whether the total number of volumes in this library has been increasing or decreasing but there is positive statistical . evidence that this number is changing ctramatically. I will outline eviclence to confirm my belief that possibly the number is increasing but I seem to be in a minority of one and would . appreciate _your expert opinion concerning this matter. The Union College Library has never been accused of being an · excellent source of highly sought-after and ditticult-to- obtain material$, but for some . reason these villains have chosen it as . their target. The first piece of evidence is that many volumes, some rare and quite old, seem to be difficult to locate., and my belief is that thert;! are so many new volumes to contend with that possibly they have become lost in the shuffle. Many skeptics. not as learned in criminology as I, have placed the blame on students, who for either convenience or out of maliciousness, see fit to borrow numerous volumes without informing the proper authorities and forget to return them. My faith in the student body of this college is considerably higher than thi$, and it is for this reason I search for the Mr. Big whom I am certain must be behind this mystery. This problem is not a new one; in fact, the late Dr. Tolan, past head of the library, was quite aware of it. Each year he had a standing bill in the Budget and Priorities Committee to purchase an electronic security system for this library and each year it had been refused. In conjunction with an officer of this college, whom I shall call Dean; a fellow student, whom I shall call Otto; did research into the cost and efficiency of this type of system at the library of Hofstra University. The price, $19,999, is sub- stantially less expensive than that of replacing m1ssmg volumes (obviously now existing in duplicate), but for some reason this proposal has been continuously rebuked. It is for this reason I am convinced that the total number of volumes must he increasing rather than decreasing. If the school was actually being robbed of so many expensive articles, I am quite sure they would quickly take action. But, if, as 1 believe, the number is increasing, this would explain their complacentness and willingness to spend such vast amounts of money to continuously reorganize the existing or remaining volumes. Whatever the cause, the rroblern remains, more money IS spent in maintaining the level of competence of this library than would be needed to . install a security device which would do the same. and possibly allow for the improvement of what is not one of the better libraries on a co.llegiate level. And sir, if you thmk me mad, question any student who has searched for a book cmly to find out frotn the librarian it has neither been removed officially nor is it occ~pying_ its ordinary locatron. It IS, as we say in the sleuth vernacular, MISSING IN ACTION. Sincerely, Jeff Forman

In an away contest, they suffered a disappointing 9-1 loss, only to come back in a home game and lose by one: 4-3. Needless to say 1 the Union Women's Hockey team has come a long way.

Grant Judd, who put on a performance of hard skating and strong checking, took a pass from Kip Churchill and let loose a powerful wrist shot on goal.

Iceinen of the Week This past week, the Union Dutchmen played only once, trouncing the highly ranked University of Waterloo from Canada by a score of 8-2. The two outstanding players were centermen .K..ev 111 Kardos and forward Dean Willers. Kardos, a hustling sophomore, who haih from Livonia, M lC;htgan, played an excellent two-way game and was an imtrumental part of many of the L mon go a 1 s, even though he only rcgt~tered one assist. Besides helping to set up two goab by ·1om Pahap11l and the first Umon tally by Jack Rankin, hts stick control and elusiveness resulted in him being personnally responsible for numerous Waterloo penalties, some o1 which led to Union scores. His skating ability makes an excellent penalty killer, an asset he also exhibited against Waterloo. Willers, a freeshman from Toronto, Ontario, had an outstanding offensive game, scoring his ninth and tenth goals of the year and assisting on two others. One assist was the result of his beautiful lead pass that sent Kip Churchill on the way to a breakaway goal. His ten goals are the most among the freshmen and he is sure to score many more. Both of his goals were a direct result of strong forechecking and, combining it with his consistent backcheckmg, made for a sturdy two-way game, which is Dean's trademark. rebound to tie the game at 2-2. BAKER GETS ASSIST On a 5 on 4 powerplay Tom Pahapill took the rebound of a ChuCk Pappas shot and at 14:38 put the Dutchmen on top for good. Steve Baker figured in the next goal, the first time a Union goaltender has done so, when 21 , seconds later he cleared the puck to Willers who hit Churchill at the Waterloo blue line and drove it home for the conversion. Just 14 seconds later Pahapill notched his second of the night, assisted by Pappas and Kevin Kardos. The Dutchmen lit up the red light for the fifth time in the period at 17: 12 when Mario Giallonardo hit Churchill down in the face off area to the right of Waterloo's goaltender. Churchill centered a perfect feed to Dean Willers who upped Union's lead to 6-2. Just I :25 into the final period of play, Jenkins, skating down the right side, hit Doug Feasby coming through the slot who put the puck past the left leg of Waterloo's third goalie of the night, Bob Clarke. Union controlled play for the remainder of a fairly unexciting period and capped off the scoring at 12:39 on a shorthand goal on a backhand shot by Jenkins, assisted by Marshall. Waterloo had a chance of spoiling Baker's two-period shutout when they skated with a two man advantage for the last I: II of the game, but they were denied a score by the birthday celebrant in Union's nets.

The· granting. of tenure to three Union College professors high! ighted the winter meeting of the Board of Trustees in New York City last week. Prof. l'homas Werner of the Chemistry department as well as C'la:;sics Prof. Helen Testroet were declared tenurable, and Prof. Barry Smith of the Atts department was gr;mted tenure on recommendations stemming from the Academic Affairs committee. . . -- .. .Only sixty per cent of the faculty can have tenure spots at any given time. Prof. Smith was granted one because an opening existed for him within his department. Profs. Werner and Testroet were only deClared 'tl~nurable' because no such openings were available;· they will receive tenure status when such spots appear in their respecti-ve d~partments. In addition to deciding upon the tenure appointments, the Board also secured a report from the Provost concerning the proposed budget for the academic year 1977-1918. The budget was not submitted as a finalized proposal (this was due partially to Comptroller Dale Timberlake's illness when the budget was being drawn up), and it will not be formally approved unt·il the April meeting~ The trustees, however, were pleased with the condition of the budget, They did caution the Provost to make sure that expenditures do no: exceed revenues; otherwise, there was negligible discussion on the matter. At the full Board meeting President Thomas Bonn:er presented his report which cautioned against comparing Union in an unfavorahle light with other colleges (i.e., Williams). He highlighted Union's academic diversity and extra- curricular strengths while describing the model of higher education which he feels Union should follow. The Pro:vost utilized his report to explain some of the recent personnel changes. _Trustees Make Financial Moves The report presented by Student Trustees Chris· Taylor and Andrew Koblenz spoke of the different aspects of student involvement on campus. They mentioned the lack of non- academic intellectual involvement as one of the biggest problems at Union. The report also praised the increased student participation in the intramural athletics programs and other campus concerns. . . The Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees, meeting at the University Club in New York. City last Wednesday, took action in areas that will greatly affect the he~lth of the Union College portfqlio (ajk/a, its endowment). ·comntoaPF!und Remov~ · shifted. .

Most of ·this money usually goes into the· opera'ting budget. Now, the trustees will limit the endowment income contribution to the school's budget. The portfolio earns ab~ut S.S percent· income: now only 4.5 percent will go into the .operating budget, · and . I percent will be reinvested. in this way the endowment will be allowed to grow and thus streniD;hen in the years to come. The trustees discussed the report of the Task ·Force on Athletics very briefly, and ~t the end of the meeting. They made no decision on the report, but instead tnovel;i to r~serve action until . campus reaction can be properly assessed. This decision will probably be. made at the April meeting. The first action that tJ:te committee took was to remove $500,000 of . Union's funds from the Common Fund and place it iQ.. 'the general endowment. The Common Fund is a. special fund . that is used l>y small colleges to invest their money at low risks.

It is to many an alien problem. Hut faint hopes still linger! Does Carter's poJicy of centralization .provide fot curbing the powers of the CIA which had acquired a crusading spirit and was becoming autonomous of Washington? Some cynics have dismissed the appointment of Andrew Young to the United Nat ions as some clever move to appease Blacks. Young becomes only a figure head in a position devoid of any policy making powers and finds himself in a fix because of the very nature of his job. Yet in Young, many see a brighter future . Will morality prevail and a solution be found to the Southern African situation or are any peace terms going to be dictated by a record $2 billion of investments by American owned firms in that country? Will Vance be able to win the confidence of the South African nationalist, or is that bloody struggle going to drag on to greater proportions? These questions are typical problems the Carter administration must face. Carter would undoubtedly be one of the greatest statesmen of all times if he could untie the knot. But common sense shows the futility of attempts to solve this situation, if the greater problems of the East and West relations are not first resolved, for only East and West relations dictate policies as to the actions in the areas of competition. Africa can only acquire a breathing space if East and We.st are at peace. But can she afford to hope?

Andy Koblenz, junior trustee, gauging student sentiment at the special Forum meeting last week. JJ Volume 106, No. 11 Jal_!uary 26, 1977 Trustees Meet Topics: Tenure,Budget,and Sports The granting of tenure to three Union College professors highlighted the winter meeting of the Board of Trustees in '\few York City last week.

They mentioned the lack of non- academic intellectual involvement as one of the biggest problems at Union. The report also praised the increased student participation in the intramural athletics programs and other campus concerns. The Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees, meeting at the University Club in New York City last Wednesday, took action in areas that will greatly affect the health of the Union College portfolio (a/k/a, its endowment). Common Fund Removed The first action that the committee took was to remove $500,000 of Union's funds from the Common Fund and place it iQ the general endowment. The Common Fund is a special fund that is used by small colleges to invest their money at low risks. The Fund does provide a useful service to small colleges, but its low-risk aspect is complemented by a very low rate of return. Committee Chairman Norton Reimer felt that it was more important to get a higher return on our investments; he recommended that the money be shifted. The other committee members concurred, and, excluding unforseen complications, such a reinvestment will be completed in the near future. Livingstone Gift Allocated The second move that was made concerned the allocation of the two mlll!on dollar Livingstone gift. Union will be in possession Arab The Union College International Relations Club sponsored an appearance on the Union College campus last Wednesday night (January 19) by Mr. Badr Hamman of the Arab Information Center in Washington, D.C. Mr. Hamman, a lawyer, historian, and diplomat and a graduate of Cairo University, lectured on the topic of Arab oil policy, oil pricing, and of the gift within the next few months. The Committee decided that the money should be categorized as \funds acting as endowment.\ This means that the money will be earning income for the college, but will not be available for general campus use except by action of the Board of Trustees. The Committee also reaffirmed their commitment to increasittg the endowment by reinvesting the income it earns. Most of this money usually goes into the· operating budget. No'w, the trustees will limit the endowment income contribution to the schooi's budget. The portfolio <:arns about 5.8 percent income: now only 4.5 percent will go into the operating budget, · and I percent will be reinvested. In this way the endowment will be allowed to grow and thus stren~hen in the years to come. The trustees discussed the report of the Task Force on Athletics very briefly, and at the end of the meeting. They made no decision on the report, but instead movelif to reserve action until campus reaction can be properly assessed. This decision will probably be made at the April meeting. Diplomat Speaks OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) cartel economic policy. He dealt with such issues as oil pricing policy, oil \petrodollar\ investment, and the growth policies of the oil exporting countries themselves. Mr. Hamman 1n his presentation, sought to outline the recent history of OPEC policy, particularly that of the Arab members in the cartel (7 out of 13). Concentrating on the post October '73 Yom Kippur war period, Mr. Hamman dealt with the four-fold increase in oil prices, the huge buildup of dollars on the part of the OPEC nations, and the tremendous levels of investment on the part of these nations in foreign markets. Unfortunately for the International Relations Club and the college community as a whole, the most noteworthy occurrence of this lecture was the lack of interest shown by the student body. Although widely advertised only twenty people saw fit to attend this lecture. The lack of student interest in the lecture very much detracted from what could have been a meaningful discussion of a very significant topic. Grulllet Heads New Univ. Center Barbara R. Grumet, of Albany, has been appointed acting director of the new Center for Health Care and Law of Union University, Chancellor Thomas N. Bonner has announced. Establishment of the center is one of the most ambitious joint ventures yet undertaken by Union University. It involves four of the University's five member institutions: Union College. Albany Law School, Albany· Medical College, and the Albany College of Pharmacy. Other than the position of chancellor, the post is the first to exist totally as a University entity that is, with no special allegiance to any one of the University's member institutions. Each institution is committed to contributing a certain amount of the operating expenditures of the new center for at least one year. It is hoped that by the end of that time the center will receive enough funds from other sources to be self-supporting. In the position, Grumet will report directly to Chancellor Bonner. Her office will be located at the Albany Medical College. Dr. Bonner said the objectives of the Center will include the collection and dissemination of information regarding the legal aspects of health and medical care services, the offering of courses for those in the administrative, clinical and legal aspects of health and mental health services. and promoting discussion between doctors and lawyers about innovations and problems in the area of medical care. .. We want to educate doctors and lawyers so that they will have a better understanding of each other's professions,\ said Grumet. Such an understanding is particularly important in view of the increasing involvement of government m medicine evidenced by Medicare and Medicaid, increased regulation of drugs. new insurance regulations, group health care programs and mounting talk of a national health care program, she said. There are no plans for the center to offer degrees for its programs. However, students at all four institutions taking part will be able to earn credit toward degrees at their respective schools by taking courses at the center. Urumefs other responsibihttes will include attracting outside sources of support, collecting research and materials on forensic medicine, and developing a short and long range plan for the center.

,_ ' ~. . ~ C:ONCORDIEN$1S, Jtm. 26, 1977 GreenhOuse Grows On by IRENE ROSEN An interesting but a,s yet practica,Hy uQpublicized structure on ·campus is the greenhouse. Located directly behind the Arts Building, the greenhouse remains somewhat of an unknown entity on campus. However, the greenhouse may be a valuable source of information to anyone Who has an interest in plants. For example, one can learn the prop~r care for a specific plant that he/ she might have. Also, there is a large map in the greenhouse stating the various types of plants and the countries of their origins. Besides being informative, there are some very interesting plants in the greenhouse. There is a coconut tree from Hawaii which is approximately four feet tall. A P·untia is there which is .basically our typical vision of a Westerncactus. There is a coffee tree wfth unnpe berries, and a Bird of Paradise plant from South Afr.ica. This tree has brilliant orange flowers with blue sprouts. An interesting plant is the Burrow's Tail. This is a large plant with hanging shoots ·which look just like furry animal tails. Artificial tropics located in our own Jackson Gardens. The major- person who works in the greenhouse is Dick. A friendly man who has worked as Union's gardener fflr the past eleven years, Dick's main job in the greenhouse is to propogate seeds for cutting~ to be placed around campus. Basically, Dick is the man wh:p is responsible for the bea\,ltHul flower arrangements, in Jacks on's Gardens every spring. He also does. the arrangements in front of the Priesident~s house~ in Mrs. Perkin's Garden, · and around campus.

LeHer to the PEOPLE ·Dear Friend, Back in 1931, racial prejudice .and hatred brought death sentences for nine black teenagers in Scott.sboro, Alabama, after they were falsely accused of . raping two white women. , This infamous case is supposed to be ancient history, and many saw the recent pardon of the last known living \Scottsboro Boy'' as proof that the timeJor such gross injustices in the South is at last over. But is it ·really? In just a few weeks five black youths in Daw'son, Georgia, face trials which could place them in the electric chair for a crime they did not commit - the killing of a white man during a store holdup. The Center has taken their case, and I want to tell you their story and then explain why we urgently need your help if we are to prove their innocence. Early last year; the murder victim went into a .small country store on the outskirts of Dawson, a little . town not far from Plains, Georgia. The store owner says that four black males walked in a few minutes later. The owner states that while he was bending over to get something behind the counter, he heard a shot. When he looked up, the four blacks were wearing ski PERSPECT~VE, _Jan. 26, 1976 • Un1on L\d.lrt.-.a..a. :;BlacK · · . StUdent$' AUia~tca News pare-r • • • • 8 • AbdouJai g,,..~,, leonard D.

This past fall 105 people sought counseHng (both individually and · through the groups), which is well in keeping with the center's usual 250 to 300 per year. When asked about possible trends, DoWliag responded that in his five years at Union, things have been ~·quite stable,'' despite incre~sing · .co-education, high academic competition, and th4! emph~sis en ••rounding out\ the Union <:ommunity. Dowling explains that, .. people are people,\ and people will always have problems. \While we should work constantly to improve the environment, people err to think we can rearrange the college,\ in or~er to wipe out problems. He admits that the environment can exacerbate potential problems, but stresses that it does not create them. Class Differences There seems to be a specific anxiety that plagues every class. Freshmen have adjustment problems and the fear of the unknown. They have to learn how to find a median between academic pressures and the social life. Sophomoresare even blessed with a special term, \Soj>homore Slump.\ The exciting, new Union College becomes a dull, uninteresting place; and the unattached girls are warned about the freshman competition. Juniors are busy taking MCATs and LSA T's, and Seniors are paranoid about what their future will hold. But on the whole the differences among classes are not proqounc~d. There is just a general state of depression. Talk Line: Dial Help and a Friend The U 11ion College community will soon benefit from a new program which will hopefully alleviate the troubles of its members. · Sponsored' · by Fox House, and under the supervision of Adie Carlyle; Mike Kramer and Phyllis O'Flahery of the counseling service,· a Talk Line has been established in order to reach students, wherever they are. Eighteen students will take turns manning the phones. The Talk Line, which is not a crisis line (i.e. reserved for major problems). will be there for anyone who is lonely, or needs that everyone has a ne~d for an outlet and this is an opportunity to provide one by allowing students 'to help other students. Talk Lines are prevalent on , Qollege campuses these days and : have met with great· success and ,-,popularity. , . Complete confidentiality on , both sides of the phone call will be insured. Absolutely no records , will be kept ang no names will be · exchanged. No information will be giVen out to any person or office on campus. MULTIPlJRPOSEFUL as birth control clinics, cancer societies, Alcoholics Anonymous, .and various church groups. A three day training session was held to allow those interested in the program to qualify for participation. Role playing (acting out hypothetical situations) and basic discussion were the ~ore of the program. The importance of the tone and the diction of one's voice were stressed. Above aU, empathy and sincerity were laid down as the foremost .attributes necessary for someone on the Talk Line sta.ff. The projected opening date for the· Talk Line is Tuesday, February 1.

College age is a time when people are faced with new responsibilities and a lot of decisions to make. The phrase \College is the best time pf your life\ seems ironic when college is also a· time when many conflicts arise. The biggest problem on campus is loneliness. People' are lost in a crowd. There is a lack of response from others, and relationships leave much to be desfred. As Dean Smith coined it, it is \loneliness within a crowd\ - being with people as physical entities,. not spiritual beings. \People don't really know how to relax and have fun. There are not many outlets on campus, or in the surrounding area for people to get away. People live very restricted lives. They tend to stay in their rooms or study. Everyone falls into a rut. The College doesn't reach out to help these lonely and shy people.\ Another important problem that students have is \learning to respond to pressure - pressure from parents, from academics, and from other students.\ .. The students have to learn how to handle pressure without letting it scare them to the point where it becomes a destructive factor in relationships.\ \The students at Union are-trapped by fears about the present and for the future . ., Dean Smith alse sees sexism, and other prejudices, as psychological problems. ••There is a great fear of relinquishing sexism.\ Prejudices are just symptoms -of fear. This sexism is a prejudice against women that the women help to p-erpetuate, as well as the men, by underrating themselves. \The presence of sexism, racism and anti-semitism on campus means lives aren't as interesting as they should be~\ These fears preclude the formation of diverse relationships. This is another factor that makes a student's life more restrictive. Solutions Dean Smith believes more emphasis on a truly intellectual campus would solve these problems. This would mean more excitement and creativity on campus, utilizing the students' talents ta their maximum. He feel~ better relationships between faculty and students would do away with the psychological problems. \This will only come about through student initiative. The students should work to bring the faculty on campus.\ There should be more of an emphasis on the professors as people, not as the day-time teachers they are. ''Mixing academics and social aspects is the most fun on campus.\ As Dean Smith sees it, what it comes down to is loneliness as the real prablem, nqt apathy. \The feelings of the students are too aggressive to be apathetic. People are under pressure not to do something. They must break through their super-seriousness of worrying about the future. Students must learn to live for now, by not doing so they are restricting their lives and wasting talent. What is really needed is a diversity of experience.\ Someone to talk to will always be only a phone call away. ; ' •.•• 1:: t,f .r ;. J t.~ I,· ,

Alternatives to Depression Union does in fact offer numerous opportunities to defray the effects of a harsh winter.

On a more serious note, the Union community contains some sources of solace for the student with problems relating to the state of the mind.

The College doesn't reach out to help these lonely and shy people.\ Another important problem that students have is \learning to respond to pressure - pressure from parents, from academics, and from other students.\ \The students have to learn how to handle pressure without letting it scare them to the point where it becomes a destructive factor in relationships.\ \The students at Union are trapped by fears about the present and for the future.\ Dean Smith also sees sexism, and other prejudices, as psychological problems. \There is a great fear of relinquishing sexism.\ Prejudices are just symptoms of fear. This sexism is a prejudice against women that the women help to perpetuate, as well as the men, by underrating themselves. \The presence at sexism, racism and anti-semitism on campus means lives aren't as interesting as they should be.\ These fears preclude the formation of diverse relationships. This is another factor that makes a student's life more restrictive. Solutions Dean Smith believes more emphasis on a truly intellectual campus would solve these problems. This would mean more excitement and creativity on campus, utilizing the students· talents to their maximum. He feel~ better relationships between faculty and students would do away with the psychological problems. \This will only come about through student initiati\e. The students should work to bring the faculty on campus.\ There should be more of an emphasis on the professors as people, not as the day-time teachers they are. \Mixing academics and social aspects is the most fun on campus.\ As Dean Smith sees it, what it comes down to is loneliness as the real problem, not apathy. \The feelings of the students are too aggressive to be apathetic. People are under pressure not to do something. They must break through their super-seriousness of worrying about the future. Students must learn to live for now, by not doing so they are restricting their lives and wasting talent. What is really needed is a diversity of experience.\ Talk Line:Dial Help and a Friend The Union College community will soon benefit from a new program which will hopefully alleviate the troubles of its members. Sponsored by fox House, and under the supervision of Adie Carlyle, Mike Kramer and Phyllis O'Flattery of the counseling service, a Talk Line has been established in order to reach students, wherever they are. Eighteen students will take turns manning the phones. The Talk Line, which is not a cnsis line (i.e. reserved for major problems). will be there for anyone who is lonely. or needs someone to talk to. :\ o problem is considered too small or ummportant. and e\erything will be treated with empathy and great care. Adie Carlyle pointed out t .. 1 1 I •. ~ .t. ~ .. I t, •. . I ~ o. Sp ,,. ! that everyone has a need for an outlet and this is an opportunity to provide one by allowing students to help other students. Talk Unes are prevalent on college campuses these days and have met with great success and popularity. Complete confidentiality on both sides of the phone call will be insured. Absolutely no records will be kept and no names will be exchanged. No information will be g1ven out to any person or office on campus. M U L TIPURPOSEFUL In addition to the talking and counseling services, an extensive referral service is available. This includes a directory to a multitude of organizations such as birth control clinics, cancer societies, Alcoholics Anonymous, and various church groups. A three day training session was held to allow those interested in the program to 4 uality for participation. Role playing (acting out hypothetical situations) and basic discussion were the core of the program. I he importance of the tone and the diction of one's voice were stressed. Above all. empathy and sincerity were laid down as the foremost attributes necessary for someone on the Talk Line staff. !he projected opening date for the· Talk Line is Tuesday, l'ebruary I. The centrex phone will be in operation from J I p.m. to 3 a.m., seven days a week. Someone to talk to will always be only a phone call away.

CONCORDJ'ENSJS, Jan. 26, 1977 EDITORIALS No News , • It appears that the campus has stagnated on the political frQilt. This is not for want of issues. Right now there should be committees working to devise a new .general education system (sub-committee af Educational Policy Committee), suggestions for possible revisions in the tenure system (the four campus trustees), and a unique proposal called the Internal Education Foundation which is being polished up by the Planning and Priorities Committee and which we promise you'll hear more about later\ In the meantime, the campus stagnates. Led(?) by a lethargic All- College Senate, the campus appears to be a prime eJ!;ample of the axiom, \no news is good news.\ Good news? We question whether a \small thriving liberal arts college\ really considers stagnation as good news. . At Conc:ordy, we prefer innovative change, carefully thought out to be sure, but always movement forward. Nestling peacefully in Schenectady, a quiescent campus studying for its next test or writing its next paper .is not our idea of the complete college experience. There are issues to grapple with and forums for discussion are always appropriate. Prodding is in order, Concordy needs news to survive, and we don't think it would hurt the campus either. Go Hockey We at Concordy are most disturbed by the suggestion made .by Craig Carlson, Acting .Athletic Director, that our article last week was '\intentionally .. written to exacerbate the hockey situation. Our information very weil might have been incorrect, although we did speak to an employee of the Clarkson rink and Mr. Carlson as late as last Tuesday. Nobody told us our facts were wrong. The \facts\ they gave us were the facts that appeared in print. There seems to be an impression that Coneordy is anti-hockey. True, we think,,for reasons detailed here previously, that we ought to remain in NESCAC and Di:vision U. This does not mean we do not want the hockey team to enjoy successful and fruitful seasons. The only other news articles about hockey that we have printed were stories on the Athletic Task Force, in which facts were reported. unbiased, and on the WRUC incident, which no one would argue was a legitimate news story. Tp sum up, we apologize as always for any misinformation. We are not out \to get llockey.\ There are flaws in the program, t(,) be sure, and the\ administrators that ought to be correcting them are causing even more problems. We wish the hockey te.am the best of luck and hope responsible administrators conduct our hockey program with the· air of academic integrity that befits Union. RUC Hurrah . - Everyone on this campus often appears to be a \nattering nabob of negativism\ to quote Gado via Agnew. At this time, Concordy would like to give a well-earned pat on the back to our media campus cohort, WRUC. Four years ago, RUC was a bush A.M. operation that 'was barely audible in some of the dorms. Things have changed; special programming, interview shows, a UPI teletype, news specials, t}:te Nott Wits, and of course our beloved Trivia. For our money, it's the best F.

Pa~e6 EDITORIALS No News ? • It appears that the campus has stagnated on the political front. This is not for want of issues. Right now there should be committees working to devise a new general education system (sub-committee of Educational Policy Committee), suggestions for possible revisions in the tenure system (the four campus trustees), and a unique proposal called the Internal Education Foundation which is being polished up by the Planning and Priorities Committee and which we premise you'll hear more about later. In the meantime, the campus stagnates. Led(?} by a lethargic All- College Senate, the campus appears to be a prime example of the axiom, \no news is good news.\ Good news? We question whether a \small thriving liberal arts college\' really considers stagnation as good news. At Concordy, we prefer innovative change, carefully thought out to be sure, but always movement forward. Nestling peacefully in Schenectady, a quiescent campus studying for its next test or writing its next paper is not our idea of the complete college experience. There are issues to grapple with and forums for discussion are always appropriate. Prodding is in order, Concordy needs news to survive, and we don't think it would hurt the campus either. Go Hockey We at Concordy are most disturbed by the suggestion made by Craig Carlson, Acting Athletic Director, that our article last week was \intentionally\ written to exacerbate the hockey situation. Our information very well might have been incorrect, although we did speak to an employee of the Clarkson rink and Mr. Carlson as late as last Tuesday. Nobody told us our facts were wrong. The \facts\ they gave us were the facts that appeared in print. There seems to be an impression that Concordy is anti-hockey. True, we think, for reasons detailed here previously, that we mtght to remain in N ESCAC and Division II. This does not mean we do not want the hockey team to enjoy successful and fruitful seasons. The only other news articles about hockey that we have printed were stories on the Athletic Task Force. in which facts were reported unbiased, and on the WR UC incident, which no one would argue was a legitimate news story. To sum up, we apologize as always for any misinformation. We are not out \to get hockey.\ There are flaws in the program, to be sure, and the administrators that ought to be correcting them are causing even more problems. We wish the hockey team the best of luck and hope responsible administrators conduct our hockey program with the 'air of academic integrity that befits Union. RUC Hurrah Everyone on this campus often appears to be a \nattering nabob of negativism\ to quote Gado via Agnew. At this time, Concordy would like to give a well-earned pat on the back to our media campus cohort, WRUC. Four years ago, RUC was a bush A.M. operation that 'was barely audible in some of the dorms. Things have changed; special programming, interview shows, a UPI teletype, news specials, tbe Nott Wits, and of course our beloved Trivia. For our money, it's the best F. M. station in the area and still improving. The recent decision to go twenty-four hours is a particular. boon to dissolute journalists who usher in sunsets, trying to write a: decent thesis. · Seriously, there is probably no organization on campus that can match the strides RlJ(' has taken in expansion and quality. When one considers how many student activities here have blossomed in four years, ranging from films to the ~a baret, this is quite an achievement.

CONCORDIENS!S, Jan. 26, 1977 Commentary: To the Editors: Gado on the Origins When, just prior to the Christmas holiday, I visited Mr. Gati, he showed me a letter he was drafting in response to Hope Fabian's recently published article in the Campus Voice. His sentiments-which I shared without reservation-launched a short reminiscence on our fight a decade ago against a program we were convinced was educationally unsound. After this excursion into the past ran its course, Gati brought the visit to a close with a statement in approximately these words: \What offends me is not that none of those responsible for Comp Ed_ will ever say, 'You were right,' but that, while calling for a -new -program to ·replace the mess we predicted, they will say, 'We were right then, we are right now, and you were wrong then,' you are wrong now.\' - Well, Concordiensis printed Gati's letter and the very next issue proved him clairvoyant.

But vigorous opposition to a program Martin had n_pw tied to his presidency would be seen as a· slap irt his face. To extricate ourselves from the dilemma while still attempting to convey to the President our belief that CompEd was in trouble and could· not succeed wit•hout modifications which would enlist wider acceptance, Gati and I lobbied for a large bloc of abstentions. At the meeting, silence answered Martin's call for the opening of debate. Finally, to· take the chill out of the embarrassment, one ·faculty member rose in- favor, then, in quick SJ.!ccession, three more. All were decorous remarks, an observation of protocol, which in sum took less than two minutes-remarkably brief for a topic which had caused such controversy for more than 'two years. No one spoke in opposition. We were confident our plan would succeed. Over thirty faculty members had . pledged their abstentions and we had reasonable expectations that this number would gtow, perhaps to a majority, on the floor. Martin, however, thwarted us by never calling for abstentions; a sparse affirmative voice vote was thus recorded - as unanimous assent for CampEd. Nevertheless,· the President's tactic was an acknowledgment that our point had been made; unfortunately, he then 9hose to ignore it for the rest · ·of his administration. Why review this _pbfitical . history? Simply to uilders~bre the difference between ratification of a curricular· ref arm· i. -~nd its successful implementation. A vote for CompEd, we learned from the beginning, did not translate into enth.usi:as tic participation in it. After the deadline for submitting proposals for the Options had passed, (:mly one ·was in · the J:topper~ironically, mine. Weeks of wheedling were required to s~cure more Options for the stuqents. Other levels of Comp:Ed met with a similar respo11se. Several departments which had delivered votes for CompEd _pleaded lack of manpower when it came to contributing to the program. And . too · often, departments sometimes cynically dumped their weakest or least experienced teachers into the CompEd pool. Was this a case of a good iQ.ea butchered in the execution? I believe not. The radical problem with CompEd · lay in its assumptions. Nelson•s committee, in its willingness to concede that no collection of , general courses assured a sound general education, chose to emphasize process over content. A teacher's ignorance in any given area was to be no bar to his balding a class in it-indeed, as a .. co-adventurer\ with his students (the phrase is in the original report), he was ideally suited for the aims of CompEd. And since no subject of study commanded priority over_ any oth~r. it was pointless toprescribe any sort of d·isCiplinary regimen. (I remember a discussion with Nelson at the time in which he argued that stud,y of a soap opera was as \valid\ as the study of O!ldipus Tyrannus~and given his premises, it certainly was.) Consequerttly, what the committee proposed and the faculty legislated, in effect, · consisted -of eight empty. slots (later reduced to seven)-or, to put it somewhat more kindly, eight slots with an infinite number -of variables which could be inserted into them. (Indeed, the first proposal approved by the faculty left not oncfy the slots for the Junior and Senior years but also their labels to future determination.) The same course, with some cosmetic changes, could (ancl occasionally did} serve as a Freshmen Elective, an Options course, a Disputed Question, or ~s a course among th.e department's regular offerings. . Some, choosing to ignore the question of CompEd's intrinsic · worth, will argue· that its justification lay in opening new paths. But was it really necessary to impose a four-yea.r requirement to accomplish this end? A foundation grant some years .prior to the installation -of CompEd had produced a number of interdepartmentalcourseswhich then died. for lac~ of funding; -couldn;t some of these have been re-instituted and .set forth~ as models? And wouldn't a simple statement of policy encouraging professors to .develop courses in ancillary fieids have allowed for every gooq course associated with Comp Ed· to emerge'! But even if one were to assume that CompEd was the causative agent for every good in the curriculum which has materialized during the past deeade, was it worth these prices: a destabilizing: of the grade structure (records show that the student average leaped with the introduction of CompEd, in large measure because of inflated grades in most CompEd courses); cynicism among students and faculty about the seriousness of Union's intellectual commitment; a decade in which most students never received any instruction in writing; anP, an effective brake on curricular reform during the years it was in,effect? Certainly, not everything touched by CampEd was bad. But to point to its few successes as its glory is a bit lik~ a doctor's taking pride in curingtonsillitis in the course of removing a gall bladuer when the patient was .actually suffering from ulcers. Sincerely, Frank Gado., Deparhnent of English P41gc• - BUSINESS EDUCATION AT UNION COLLEGE How many students at Union know about the extensive programs in business administration and management at the College? It is one of the many aspects of the College that sets Union apart from the scores of small, private, liberal arts colleges in the northeastern part of the Union States. The programs and courses in business are offered through the Institute of Administration and Management to hundreds of part-time (and some full-time) graduate students in Schenectady, Poughkeepsie, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In addition, the Institute adds diversity to our undergraduate curriculum through courses in statistics, accounting, and behavioral studies and thereby gives Union graduates an advantage in the job market. The Institute (JAM) began at Union in 1960, although an early undergraduate. program developed by Professor Benjamin Whitaker preceded it by nearly twenty years. Since 1960, the emphasis has been on graduate courses for persons employed in managerial and administrative positions in nearby industries. Engineers and middle- management men and women have been given training in quantitative skills, operations research, and systems analysis. Gradually the areas of -study have been broadened to include not only business and industry but health studies, public administration, and multinational businesses. Like other programs unique to Union's history, the Institute is both a part of the liberal educational climate of the college and yet closely linked to the outside world of commerce and world affairs. It continues the tradition of intellectual tension between learning and doing, between general and applied studies that began with Eliphalet N ott. It differs from other programs at the college in its practical bend, graduate emphasis, part-time students, and. expectations of its faculty. It is an integral part of the college 'in its commitment to liberal studies, scientific· method, and scholarly teaching and research. Currently, the college is seeking to define more cearly the role of the Institute in the college, its structure and governance, and its plans for future development. An important part of this closer integration of the Institute into the college will be greater support for and involvement in the undergraduate life of Union College. Union is fortunate indeed in the diversity of its progra:p1s in a time of flux and concern for the future. The Institute, like the developing programs within Union University, the growth of continuing education for adults, the increasing ties to the community, the Term Abroad program, and other undeveloped strengths, gives us a real edge over other colleges in the struggles ahead for survival and health. The spirit of Eliphalet N ott and the early days of Union still moves among these \old grey walls\ as we near the end of the 1970's. . ~. . \'- 1 \-;rFf' .. V/Eis .:....

CO.\'CORDJE/\'SJS, Jan. 26, 1977 and Politics of CompEds be beneficial prevailed, narrowly, over those who saw little merit and much mischief in CampEd. A year or so later, President Martin had arrived on campus. Many of us hoped that, given his ex. perience as director of gen ed at Harvard, he would either scrub the partly-initiated CompEd pr()gram-qu1te different from the progr.am he h~td administered- or gliide its transubstantiation. Instead, he lent it his support. This presented us with a dilemma when it came time for a vote on the implementation of Phase l1 of Com.pEd. Some of our misgivings had already been confirmed by the short trial Phase I had received; we could hardly be expected to give even tacit support ~o its extension. But vigorous opposition to a program Martin had now tied to his presidency wmild be seen as a· slap in his face. To extricate ourselves from the dilemma while still attempting to convey to the President our belief that CampEd was in trouble and could not succeed without modifications which would enlist wider acceptance, Gati and I lobbied for a large bloc of abstentions. At the meeting, silence answered Martin's call for the opening of debate. Finally, to· take the chill out of the embarrassment, one faculty member rose in favor, then, in quick Sl!ccession, three more.

A vote for CampEd, we learned from the beginning, did not translate into enthusiastic participation in it. After the deadline for submitting proposals for the Options had passed, only one was in the hopper-ironically, mine. Weeks of wheedling were required to secure more Options for the students. Other levels of CampEd met with a similar response. Several departments which had delivered votes for CampEd pleaded lack of manpower when it came to contributing to the program. And too often, departments sometimes cynically dumped their weakest or least experienced teachers into the CampEd pool. Was this a case of a good idea butchered in the execution? I believe not.

And since no subject of study commanded priority over any other, it was pomtless to prescribe any sort of d·isciplinary regimen. (I remember a discussion with Nelson at the time in which he argued that study of a soap opera was as \valid\ as the study of Oedipus Tyrannus-and given his premises, it certainly was.) Consequently, what the committee proposed and the faculty legislated, in effect, consisted of eight empty slots (later reduced to seven)-or, to put it somewhat more kindly, eight slots with an infinite number -of variables which could be inserted into them. (Indeed, the first proposal approved by the faculty left not only the slots for the Junior and Senior years but also their labels to future de~errnination.) The same course, with some cosmetic changes, could (and occasionally did) serve as a Freshmen Elective, an Options course, a Disputed Question, or as a course among the department's regular offerings. Some, choosing to ignore the question of CampEd's intrinsic worth, will argue that its justification lay in opening new paths. But was it really necessary to impose a four-year requirement to accomplish this end? A foundation grant some years prior to the installation of CampEd had produced a number of interdepartmental courseswhich then died for lack of funding; couldn't some of these have been re-instituted and set forth as models? And wouldn't a simple statement of policy encouraging professors to .develop courses in ancillary fie1ds have allowed for every good course associated with C0mp Ed to emerge? But even if one were to assume that CampEd was the causative agent for every good in the curriculum which has materialized during the past decade, wall it worth these prices: a destabilizing, of the grade structure (records show that the student average leaped with the introduction of CampEd, in large measure because of inflated grades in most CompEd courses); cynicism among students and faculty about the seriousness of Union's intellectual commitment; a decade in which most students never received any instruction in writing; and an effective brake on curricular reform during the years it was in- effect? Certainly, not everything touched by CampEd was bad. But to point to its few successes as its glory is a bit like a doctor's taking pride in curingtonsillitis in the course of removing a gall bladder when the patient was actually suffering from ulcers.

It is one of the many aspects of the College that sets Union apart from the scores of small, private, liberal arts colleges in the northeastern part of the Union States. The programs and courses in business are offered through the Institute of Administration and Management to hundreds of part-time (and some full-time) graduate students in Schenectady, Poughkeepsie, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In addition, the Institute adds diversity to our undergraduate curriculum through courses in statistics, accounting, and behavioral studies and thereby gives Union graduates an advantage in the job market. The Institute (IAM) began at Union in 1960, although an early undergraduate program developed by Professor Benjamin Whitaker preceded it by nearly twenty years. Since 1960, the emphasis has been on graduate courses for persons employed in managerial and administrative positions in nearby industries. Engineers and middle- management men and women have been given training in quantitative skills, operations research, and systems analysis. Gradually the areas of ·study have been broadened to include not only business and industry but health studies, public administration, and multinational businesses. Like other programs unique to Union's history, the Institute is both a part of the liberal educational climate of the college and yet closely linked to the outside world of commerce and world affairs. It continues the tradition of intellectual tension between learning and doing, between general and applied studies that began with Eliphalet Nott. It differs from other programs at the college in its practical bend, graduate emphasis, part-time students, and. expectations of its faculty. It is an integral part of the college in its commitment to liberal studies, scientific method, and scholarly teaching and research. Currently, the college is seeking to define more cearly the role of the Institute in the college, its structure and governance, and its plans for future development. An important part of this closer integration of the Institute into the college will be greater support for ~nd involvement in the undergraduate life of Union College. Union is fortunate indeed in the diversity of its programs in a time of flux and concern for the future. The Institute, like the developing programs within Union University, the growth of continuing education for adults, the increasing ties to the community, the Term Abroad program, and other undeveloped strengths, gives us a real edge over other colleges in the struggles ahead for survival and health. The spirit of Eliphalet Nott and the early days of Union still moves among these \old grey walls\ as we near the end of the 1970's. \ • i ~ k'. f

Which only reminds me of a friend who bought a new and expensive car; it was shiny and good-looking. Unlike the old Chevy that he traded for it, however, the new car did not work. (To use Professor Nelson's euJ>hemism, it had its failings.) My friend had the good sense of returning the new car to the dealer and got his old Chevy back. Alter ne washed it, the Chevy looked shiny. More importantly, it worked. lt did what a car is suppoed to do: Provide transportation. Now, at long last, we are returning Comp Ed to the dealers, of whom Professor Nelson was one. Is he now trying to sell us another version of new. improved happiness--an educational program that emphasizes style and approach over content? Need I say that what is \new\ is not necessarily better and that it does not make much sense to buy another product from those who sold us a lemon before'! Instead of further gimmickry called \innovation\ --as m Detroit and on Madison Avenue-we need a simple, but solid, program of general education. To repeat myself, it should introduce students to the salient features· of civilization, past and present; it should emphasize the significant over the peripheral. If you translate this principle into a general education program, you have two alternatives. One- the more flexible is to let each division of the college offer five or six rigorous introductory courses specifically designed for non- majors, of which each student would have to take two for a total of eight courses. The other alternative-- somewhat less flexible-- is to require students who cannot write well to take two English- composition courses in their freshman year and then take. in each of the divisions, one course designed for non- majors, for a total of six courses. What I am suggesting, of course, is a modified distribution requirement-a series of professionally competent courses aimed at enhancing the curiosity .and broadening the interests of non-maJors. As this program is neither fancy nor particularly \original however, Professor Nelson will likely oppose it. If so. I am afraid I will have to call him what .he called me: A nay-sayer. Sincerely, Charles Gati Department of Political Science hoekey faults To the Editors: From its conception, the Union College Hockey Program has caused a great deal of controversy among various members of the campus community. Unfortunately, the players themselves have been subjected to a great deal of criticism which they do not really deserve. I am aware that major problems exist in the present hockey program, but the source of these problems does not originate from students who just happen to play hockey. If one would. stop to think about the time and effort required of members of the hockey team he might not be so quick to criticize. The team is made up of individuals who have contributed a great deal to the school's athletic reputation as well as its winter student life. But what have they received in return'? The problems which mentioned above dealing with the hockey program have been caused by both Ned Harkness and the Union College administration. They are the ones who deserve the criticism for they have created an environment which is foreign to this campus. I don't think that it is too hard to support such a statement. But why then criticize the players? In reality they have .no control over the situation nor have they created the problems which exist. It is time we stop the negative treatment dished out to the players in student publications and in other communicative forms such as Cabaret. Let us place the blame where it is deserved, the school administration and Ned Harkness. At the same time. let's st.op the constant joking and irresponsible attacks towards the players themselves.

Sincerely, Tom Lawson The Brothers of Phi Delta Theta other sports teo To tbe Editors: Oddly enough, this letter is not concerned with the task Torce report, the tix nixes, or comp. eds.; nor is it concerned with whether or not I agree or disagree with the policy or attitude of Ned H&Tkness and Union College hockey. This letter is concerned with the attitude of the Union College community with regard to ahtletics. For the past two weeks there have been many opinions voiced in Concordiens~ as well as various other media. I don't know about anyone else, but quite frankly I am beginning to get annoyed with the whole situation. The attitude of many of the students on this campus is astonishing. If someone doesn't like theideaof standing in line an hour and a half for a hockey ticket, no one is making him-why bother? If you want to get to a hockey game and don't feel like standing in line outside. go ten minu.tes earlier. But this is not the main purpose for my writing this letter. 1 have always been aware that hockey is a popular spectator sport, but the attitude of the campus with regard to other winter sports activities this winter is very distrubing. The cotnmonly used excuse is, \I have so much work to do I have to forfeit something..\' These people wouldn't miss a hockey game. But I am not so sure that they are in attendance at basketball games, a wrestling match, a track meet, a swimming event, ()f even a women's sporting event. Before · last year basketball games usually <lrew capacity crowds. Granted, we had a stronger team then. I think perhaps one of the reasons our team has not been performing to their utmost, is the fact that all they have to do is glance up to the stands and see the fieldhouse two-thirds empty. (There were maybe 200-300 students at the Union· Wesleyan game last Wednesday.) Even though the The PENNY FINCHER QUALITYCL.QTHES- LOW PRICES USED BUT NOT ABUSED CURRENT STYLES 1122 ALl'AMONT AVE.

And by the way, the J.V.'s have won the last two games by scores of one and two points more than their opponents. lt must be discouraging to these players to see none of their fellow students in the bleachers. I am by no means implying that hockey games are not exciting, but when Union is already in double figures and the other team has failed to score a goal . in the third period, the·crowds are not necessarily on the verge of hysteria (unless of course there is a fight in progress on \_t_he ice.)

Why ~ , it that students are willing to &tand in line for one and 'fl half hours to get a hockey ticket, thea spend 3 hours watching the hockey game. not counting tbe time spent wait,ng to get in the rink to get secured in a vantage· point position, when all they have to do to watch a basketball game is walk into the fieldhouse and watch the game which lasts the same amount of time ·they have spent in line to secure a hockey ticket. For all you math majors that means a person could have seen a basketball game, a wrestling match, and a women's ice hockey game in the same amount of time it takes to be able to see a Union College hockey game. I think it is about time for Union students to listen to and follow the words from a letter to the editor of this paper last week. \A variety of talents is an asset for enrichment of a college community and respect for those talents must be recognized.\ You know, for all the disrespectful and obnoxious things said about Ned Harkness and the team. at least he and many members of the team can be seen having a good, time watching a Union basketball game. Isn't it time for the college community to wake up and see that their college consists of more than classes, · books, and Union College hockey. It would he nice to see _more of you at other winter sporting events. Even if the team is losing the event it shows that we recognize that they are giving their all to represent our college, and without their valuable time and energy there would be no winter sports at Union. So, let's budget our time more wisely-go to a varied number of events, not every flockey game (maybe that way people who have never had the chance to secure tickets to a hockey game will finally be able to see one).

·- . ' CONCORDIENS/S, Jan. 26, 1.977 Page 11 Financial .Aid News .:.. Part IU: The Theory of Need Analysis: Measuri~g Student Re~ources The College Scholarship Sen!ice need analysis has from its inception incorporated the basic principle that a student has an obligation to assume responsibility for the cost of education,. since the student is the primary beneficiary of it. This obligation is reflected through a systematic .expectation of contributions from a student's (and spouse's, if applicable) income, assets, and .other resoun:es such as social security, veteran's and/ or orphan's benefits, etc. Fundamental to the measurement of student ·resources is a determination that the student is solely responsible for providing his. or her own subsistence (independent or self- supporting student) or that both the parents and students share th·is obl~gation (dependent student). · At the present time, the United States Office of Education (USOE) criteria-. defines an independent or self-supporting student as ~me Who: (1) h~,ts not been listed, nor will be, a-s an exemp~ion for federal incom~ tax . purposes for the ca:lendat yelir(s) in which aid is received and the calendar · year prior to the academic year for ~hich it is requested; (2) has not received and will rtot receive finanW,al assistance of mor~ than $600 (in cash or kind) during and prior io calendar years in· .(l); (3)'1ias not, nor will not live for more than two weeks at home of parents, during and prior ·the calendar years hi ( l ). · The CSS and many other aware programs, such as New York State TAP and other state and federal programs, empley the. USOE definition to -distinguish between dependent and . self- supporting students when calculating student resources. Incidentally, there is a lot of research and study going on directed toward re-defining independent status, · with no indication as to what, if any, changes are to be made. In view of the limited amount of financial aid funds availa:ble at most institutions, the financial aid decision may well be one that will expect a contribution from parents with adequate financial strength even though the USOE criteria are met. -CSS makes a determination of the amount a self-supporting student can contribute by taking into account the available income, ·with allowances for size of family, various taxes, number of employed persons h1 the family, etc., and adds a contribution from assets, such as home equity, bank accounts, etc. Again, as in the The processingof assets of a Parents' Confidential Statement, certain safeguards have been built into the rationale to assure that expected contributions from assets do' not exceed a reasonable limit. Oependent student resources: Because the dependent student derives at least minimal sup.port from the patents, it is ,assumed that the student's income is reserved for educational purposes. In recognizing the student's self- help obl.igatien, the CSS imputes an amount for summer savings. This summer earnings expectation runs from $500 Tor freshmen up to $7.00 for seniors .. Opportunities for summer employment may vary con.siderable am..ong geographic regions and ot·her conditions may cause a reduction in these expected earnings. The financial a1d administrator is prepared in such cases to approve a Guaranteed.· Loan to compensate for this, should the student decide to borrow., The treatment of dependent student assets is essentially a · foJ:mality. CSS considers the dependent student's assets all at once and takes a certain percentage of savings, endowments, etc., and adds this to the student cqntribution. Social security ·benefits, veteran, war orphan, arid other benefits of this nature are also considered in determining . the dependent student's contribution. In determining the total family contribution, the CSS adds together the parents' contribution and the coatribution from the studen_t's summer savings, assets and benefits. The total family contribution is used in estimating financial need by comparing it with the appropriate student expense budget. This subtraction of family contribution from college costs could show a financial need at one college and ''no need\ at another. Our· next ai'ticle will discuss the philosophy, policies and procedures regarding financial aid at Union College and the initial year award. ~ ' .· Algur .Liquor Cent~r.

Page 12 CONCORDIENSJS, Jan~ 26, 1977 ' ~ . . 5port6 Skaters bow to Clarkson, Beat Plattsburg Last Saturday night the Union Dutchmen faced Clarkson up in Po,tsdam. Despite the 9-3 loss by Union, a point was definitely proven: U nipn can skate with the best of them. The score is not indicative of how close the game actually was as the Dutchmen quieted pre-game jeers with a more-than-impressive showing. Union Opens Scoring Forty-plus students and over 100 Boosters gave the Dutchmen ahearty welcome on to the ice at Clarkson. Although Clarkson got off the first shot of the game, Union scored just 45 seconds into the fi.rst period as Kip Churchill NAME >l<Churchill, Kip *Marshall, Don Judd, Grant Crawford, Peter Kardos, Kevin Willers, Dean Feasby, Doug Jenkins, Mark Pappas, Charles *Rankin, Jack Papahill, Tom O'Rear, Tom Hinterberger, Brad Mathewson, Dean Kaminsky, Bernie O'Connell, Mike Gazzola, Dennis Haley, Mark Baker, Steve *Tri-Captains Score By Periods Opps. 13 _ 12 16 0 41 116 Union 30 45 40 1 Baker, Steve Baxter, Jim Mins. 477 3-74 steered the puck into th{: net after passes from Dean Willers and Jack Rankin. Soon, h0wever, a penalty proved costly when Clarkson's Dave Taylor evened up the score on a power-play. Clarkson then went ahead 2-1 but the score was knotted by , Willers on a power-play rebound on a Churchill -snot. Peter Crawford also received an assist on the tally. Sloppy defensive play and unsteady goaltending led to a third goal for Clarkson, which put them ahead for ,good. Steve Baker was then replaced by Jim Baxter. .

But at this. point Union clearly began to dominate play. Strong forechecking and sharp passing kept the puck in the Clarkson zone. Redmen goalie Steve Shields was severely tested in the net, turning away a. barrage of Union shots. The Dutchmen finally capitalized at 12:33 when a shot by Dean Mathewson eluded Shields for Union's last score. Kevin Kardos and Chuck Pappas .received assists on the play. The Dutchmen came out strong in the third period hoping fot a quick goal which would have put them right back in the contest. However, Clarkson denied them and then scored themselves to increase the ·margin to three goals, 6-3. From that point on, the Garnet, playing wide-open hockey to try to get back in the ·game, were scored on three more times to make the final score 9-3. Experience Shows Playing with much more experience, Clarkson showed why they are nationally ranked. The Dutchmen played their hearts out and, even though they looked tired in _the fmal ten minutes of the game, th~y made an impression on the skeptics up :north. Clarkson players admitted that they were surprised that Union could skate with anyone. Last Night Facing a weak Division II opponent, the Dutchmen trounced Plattsburgh 16-l last night, raising their record to 11-2- l (5-l in the division.) Bombarding two goalies with 76 shots while allowing only l 0, Union skaters scored two goals in the first . period, eight in the second, and six in the third.

Last Saturday, the swim team travelled to Gepeva, New York, where it lost to Hobart by a score of 69-47. However, the 22 point difference in the score does not do justiee to the Union squad. Although Hobart swam its best · meet to date, Union led Hobart halfway through the meet. It was not until the last 2 events that Hobart actually clinched the victory. In the first event of the meet, the 200 yard medley relay, Union easily defeated Hobart by over 2 lengths of the pool. Charlie Pilzer, an Albany Pharmacy student, placed second in both the 1000 and 500 yard freestyle. Doug Richardson, a sophomore, took second place in the 200 yard freestyle with a time of I :57.9 seconds, which is fast for this early in the season. Tom Broderick, Marty King, and Mark Peronto, a prom1smg freshman, also contributed second places in the 50 freestyle, 200 backstroke and 200 breastroke respectivelv.
