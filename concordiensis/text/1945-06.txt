The Delphic Society, a new hon- orary organization, received of- ficial acknowledgment on January 1, 1945, and joined the family of Student Activities. The purposes of the organization are: To per- form services for Union College and to maintain its old traditions and college spirit. The members represent a cross section of the civilian student body. The constitu- tion states there shall be no re- ligious or racial descrimination in this organization.\ ---o---- Union Goes .. Over Tile Top 11 in Drive Union College went well over the top in the recent United C~m­ munity and War Chest Campargn for 1945 which was launched throughout the nation from May 3 to May 16. General chairman for the campus, Dr. Joseph D. Doty, announced this week that the sum of $1308 was contributed from the .ca:rnpus. The quota for the college was set at $1250. Union College, one of the first units to go over the top, raised 105 per cent of its quota. Director's Praise The general chairman of this campaign for Schenectady gave the highest praise to the college for its successful drive. Sincere and welcome thanks was also given to the committee members and to all individuals who participated to make the chest campaign go well over the top. ---·o--- Prof. W. C.

Prom Is Starlight Soiree Swell As Seniors Bid Farewell To All College Pell Mell The curtain has been up for two hours on the Starlight Soiree, the epitome of Union's first Prom Weekend in over two years at Garnetville. Looking around us we have found the Starlight dec- orations of the Alumni Gymnasium a pleasant change to the gym's usually bleak walls. Another pleas- ant sight is the a·bsence of train- ing bodies on the floor, and the presence or the fairer sex dancing. The Prom Committee is here in full force. The dress blue uniform of Robert E. Hempton may be seen dividing its time between the dance fioor and the booth of Pla- toon B-1. And he isn't alone either. Walt Short, Bob Potter, AI Plam- beck, Cal Simmons, Tom Reid, Jr., Tom Carney, and Fran McMath, the other members of the Prom Committee, can all be seen here in the gym having a good time. They've really done a fine job and we're glad to see things running off as smoothly as they are. Is Everybody Happy? Some two hundred couples have been dancing to the music of Doc. Zanella and his orchestra this eve- ning. As we look around from time to time, we can see our faculty chaperones enjoying themselves. President and Mrs. Whitaker, Lt. and Mrs. F. Andreen head our list of chaperones. Also can be seen Dr. and Mrs. W. W. Bennett, Lt. and Mrs. G. Hall, Mr. and Mrs. W. Ketz, Prof. and Mrs. H. Bibber, and Mr. and Mrs. \Mel\ Hein-to name but a few. All in all everyone is having an evening of gaiety and forgetfulness. Real Ol' Not? Have you noticed the fountain in the center of the floor? Any of the water splash on you yet? We don't know how they did it but the spray from the fou~tain is pretty heavy at time. The Prom Com- mittee sure went in for realism didn't it? ' Joke! Joke! Joke! When one of our more serious underclassmen was asked for his definition of a kiss LOOK what he came back with! \A kiss is an anatomical juxtapositi>t~n of two orbicular muscles in a state of con- traction.\ Wow! Guess that will hold some of us in more ways than one. Before the evening is over we all have our own definition of a kiss but in not as many words. Gaod Luck and Farewell . The. Starlit?ht, Soiree is in keep- mg wrth Umon s policy of having a Prom once a term sever since the accelerated program was in- stituted. The Concordy's staff is glad to see each and every one of you here tonight. Some of your faces we have seen before at past proms and may we see them again at future proms .... In a more se- rious vein of thought, this is the last prom for the forty-one mem- bers of the senior class and to them we wish bon voyage and God speed. ---0----- Wingerath Rests At Ellis; Appendicitis A.S.

Future lawyers, businessmen, authors, diplomats, teachers and just plain loafers were tearing their hair and racing from prof to prof in search of seminar courses. The reason for this mad- ness was obvious; the sum of ten whole courses were being offered in the whole divi- sion. Of these ten courses, five are underclass courses. Of the upperclass courses, one is a history course, two are government courses, and two are philosophy courses. Fol' a school which was once predominant- ly a liberal arb in:;titution, this cul'l'iculum is almost absurd. Three of the upperclass courses are scheduled on Tuesday, Thul'sday and Satunlay; one is unscheduled as to hours, and the one history cour.se is well scheduled on :\Ionday, \\' ednesday and Fri- day. Are we to presume that Uni011 College is to someday discontinue its Social Studies Division? Are we to presume that the college does not feel this division to he important enough to continue in full force? A1·e we to presume that the undergraduates now in this division are to be slowly eliminated from this great educational institution? We sincerely hope not! But we have our fears. It is a near impossibility for any man in this division, regardless of his desire, to major in any field. Are S. S. men to be com- pletely excluded from the elective system? From the number and types of courses of- fered, this would be our assumption. \\·e do not understand why, nor do we 1 ask why, the administration has not been n1ore liberal and ge11erous with this key sec- tion of the college. We cannot, however, un- derstand their action. Is it well to have such a condition exist when advertising the at- tributes of Cnion College to prospective stu- dents? Is it well to let the present members ' of this division take what they can get, and l.et it go at that? Has Union College failed in its attempt to provide the type of courses which the students want? What has become of the great \liberal education\ of which Union has been so proud for 150 years? 1\Iust the Social Studies Division become a war tragedy while the other divisions en- large, or at least remain constant? Is there no way a man interested in the \relations between men,\ as the study of the liberal arts is purported to present, to obtain the kind of subjects in which he is most interest- ed? We believe that here is a legitimate squawk!
