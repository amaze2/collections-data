Please note the switch in room, which was necessitated by a cbange in the Evening Division class schedule. As is normally the case, all interested members of the College community are invited to attend. With matters ·of great importance under consideration, students are urged to take an active role in their governmental institutions, as one way of encouraging the most desirable administrative decisions • Still deating with the 1 clauses of Proposal I, the meeting approved an amendment originating from within the Divisions, asserting that \New business will be invited from the floor in College Senate meetings.\ An additional modification (which apparently was ommitted from the original text of the Report through over- 1 .ight) was passed, explaining that in cases in which there are disputes over whether a specific matter is of an academic or non- academic nature, the matter will be considered academic unless two-thirds of the College Senate overrides this view. Several notable amendment attempts failed. A provtston which would allow business to be placed on the Senate agenda by any two members of the Senate was rejected. The General Faculty, by a vote of 26-41, also turned down an amendment recoinrileticling that all meetings of the College Senate should be open to the public. Two amendments, both serving as attempts to limit the President's power to select committee chairmen, were defeated; This would have been a_ modification of Proposal II from the Report. Under consideration of Proposal III, two important amendments were approved, involving the factors of ·eferendum and initiative. \ccording to the first of the amendments, within thtity days after Senate action, a petition signed by either one-fifth of the students or the faculty expressing an opposite opinion will result in a campus referendum on the issue. The initiative amendment states that new business will be placed on the College Senate agenda if one-ftfth of either the students or faculty sign a petition to that effect. Further action on the Governance Report will occur when the General Faculty meets on Tuesday. An informal and rather~aphazard survey of faculty opinion indicates that there is some resistance to rapid approval of the full contents of the Report. A professor residing within Division I, expressing a belief · which appears . fairly widespread, castigated the admhi-· istration for its extremely aggressive style of maneuvering in support of the Report as it is presently constituted. One pro- minent student source, while personally in favor of the general contents of the Report, told of strong ar1il measures being utilized · by Administration· figures. Aside from this degree of faculty resentment, which may be rooted in issues fall removed from governance, there is a genuine feeling among some that more deliberation is nee(led in 'order to produce a better final product. •

To the Editor; Anyone who has been reading the Concordiensis recently 1\nows that the college faces something of a financial squeeze. The President is under orders from the Trustees to balance the budget over the next two years.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ' EAST '\VEST -Chicago 1 Los Angeles Pittsburgh 2 Cincinnati New York 3 San Francisco Philadelphia 4 Houston Montreal~ 5 Atlanta by MIKE MESEROLE Ron Swoboda is no longer a New York Met. He was tmded to the Montreal Expos yesterday; for some clown named Don Hahn, and with his departure the New York Mets are no longer the team that Casey Stengel coined the word \amazin'\ for. They are just another baseball team now, not at all ·like the delightful losers of the early 'sixties or the incredible World Champions of 1969. Now they're just average, and the reason is Swoboda - or rather, the lack of him. Without Ron Swoboda, the Mets have lost their character. Throughout their nine year existence, the Mets could be counted on for a few laughs. No matter how bad .things seemed, there was always the Polo· Grounds, Casey, Marvelous Marv, Hot Rod Kanehl, Roger Craig, Choo-Choo Colema~ and the rest. Dammit, we really loved those guys. They infected us with a lightness of heart that eased the pain of losing the Dodgers and Giants. Who cared if they didn't play ball as well as the deserters, they were ours, and it was a beautiful relationship. Ron Swat-boda, as the message-gram o~ the scoreboard liked to call him, arrived in New York with Shea Stadium and the 1964 World's Fair. He was a combination of both. Out in right field he was often as disasterous defensively as the Fair was financially, but at the plate he was as picturesque as Chez Shea. whether he was striking out five times in one game or knocking homers into the Cross Bronx Expressway. When 1969 happened and we were forced to share the Mets with the rest of the .country, it was Swoboda who most exemplified the ballclub,. only the public didn't realize it. Everybody swooned at the sight of Tom (anti Nancy) Seayer, marveled at Jones and Agee, and dug Gil Hodges' Mr. Cool routine. But Swoboda was the catalyst of it all. The Mets were not supposed to be any good; remember how the powerful Birds from Baltimore were going to peck their brains out? Remember how the Mets whipped them in five qui<:k games? Well, Ronald Swobod~;t wasn't supposed to be so hot either, but he hit .400 in ~he Series, knocked in the 6 Kansas City St. Louis· ._6 San Diego ALL*STAR TEAM$ • NATIONAL LEAGUE AMERICAN LEAGUE.

But he took the chance and it paid off, and the guy who used to field more fly balls off his head than in his glove was a World Series hero. Now he's gone. Gone because he didn't play as much as he thought he should have last year, and because he said so publicly, which is a. very serious no-no. Given up on at age 26 and sent to Canada. for peanuts by the same geniuses who hustled Ed \The Glider., Charles out of the organization right after the Series victory for no reason, and who traded Amos Otis to Kansas City for J()e Foy. However, next Tuesday when the Mets open their 19ZJ seas\n at home, the opposition will be the Montreal Ex,pos, who have a du<le named Ron Swoboda playing right field. I wouldn't miss this one for the World. If I hadn't been naggecl into getting a checkup, I'd be kicking up daisies. The toughest fight I ever had didn't happen on any big, wide screen. It happened in real life. I was .just finishing my 99th picture. My 99th ridin', jumpin', flghtin' picture. Never felt better in my life. I told the family when I'm through here, I'm going out on my boat. Sure, they said, just as soon as you've had your medical checkup. I said nonsense, I had one eight months ago. They said it was more like eighteen; So I said okay, okay, and then the X-rays showed a spot on my lungs. It was cancer. If I'd waited a few more weeks, I'd be dead. The first couple .of months after sut·gery, it hurt like · hell to get on my horse. Since then 1ve 1 been good as new. If you caught \True Grit 11 or \\Chisum\ you've seen for yourself. So, friend, I know what I'm talking about when I tell you, get a checkup. Talk som~one you like into getting a c:;heckup. Nag someone you love into getting a . checkup. ~ And when the lady from the American Cancer Society rings your doorbell, dig deep in your pocket. They're working to rid fhis world of cancer once and for all. · · · ! Americ.an Cancer Society We want to wipe out cancer in your lifetime. ® oy LE~PlN' It appears . thtit several well- qualified bas~ball players were cut frofU the baseball team. One fr!,!shman hit .350, .450, and .430 in three years of high- school ball, and was an all.;league selection in the latter two years. Another batted .564 in his senior year in high . school, ani was asked to a major-league tryout camp after he got his team's only three hits in a game against a . 'tUM tJ iiJiJif, o 1 u~ highly-touted pitching prospect. However, they were among 15 players abruptly cut from the squad. (A total of 18 players made it.) T~e unanimous (or near· unanimous) feeling among those 15 cut is that the so-called \tryouts\ were unfair; additionally, many of the 18 that comprise the team agree with that appraisal. One student said his -tryout consisted of fielding numerous ground bans while taking only six half-swings at half-speed pitches. (The slow pitching was necessitated by poor lighting in Memorial Field House; where tryouts were staged.) . Another said, \The coach never watched me at all.\ - The consensus is that there were four tryout periods between March 16 and 23. however, \Coach Lawrence was present ~;tt only two of thos.e sessions.\ What criteria were. used? \If the coach didn't know your name, you had no chance.\ (the apparent anonymity of the 15 is· being maintained here in order not to jeopardize anyone's future participation in s.ports.) Surprisingly, several participants felt · that height was the determining factor in certain cases. Giving weight to these claims is the fact that of the five non-itching freshmen to make the squad, four were on the freshman basketball, football, or track squads, meaning that Coach Lawrence knew them. (Pitching tryouts, held separately, were fair.) The fifth is 6' 2\ taU. The season opens on Wednesday, April 7. It turns mit that snow is still keeping practices indoors; but tryouts could have continued through the present week so ~s to give everyone a fighting chance. It is unfortunate that there are exactly 18 uniforms in existence. While it is my feeling that the squad should hold as many as 25 players, many disagree, the feeling being that we should have a junior varsity or even a freshman team. A .564 average may not impress a coach of some 30-odd years like Art Lawrence, but that doesn't make it any less impressive. It's not that the person should have made the team for that reason, but at least he should have been afforded a chance to demonstrate his (obvious) ability to make it. It has become painfully clear to me that the athletic department is not meeting the needs of the student body. I hope newly-appointed athletic director Allison will do something · to amend this deplorable state of affairs. G\ .I)

The new president emphasized . that the training .of disc jockeys would be of major importance .again this term as it was under the leadership of former president Bob Ditter. Because of the Skidmore station's recent commencement of broadcast operations there is now less time available for Union WRUC students on the air. This will lead, Francolino indicated, to a beneficial competition for the remaining spots left in prime 'time. In order to further involve station mem hers in the operational aspects of the organization the general manager ilas started training periods designed to help students gain an FCC third class license. This type of license will be necessary for being a ''jock\ on the proposed FM station. SeaTrain is a group of . musicians with an exciting sotmd created from unusual instrumental combinations (jazz flute, electric violin and guitar) .and diverse musical backgrounds.

Ninety-five percent of those graduating students were blacks for ... although our colleges are thoroughly integnfted, assuring educational opportunities to bla~k students is our principle concern. What's happened to our graduates ... later? They include 85 percent of the nation's black physicians, 75 percent of the nation's. black. Ph.D's and more than 50 percent of all black officials elected to office in the U.S. And that's only the \bare bones\ of our record, for thousands upon thousands of our graduates have been· modifying the course of American historyinrecerttyears by their rational, self- disciplined and determined struggle for social· justice through non- violent revolution. Today hundreds of thousands of other young black Americans need your help to enable them to help build a more creative, dynamic America .•.. and a more peaceful world.

Pour ln For Tedisco • • • p Three short years ago, six outclassed . athletes represented Union in its own inv.itational track meet. The results were. disastrous, with the cindermen failing to · tally a single point in the competition. In the three years since. though, Union track has experienced a remarkable renaissance. Led by the likes of runners Rick Jaszc2:ak and Tim McCabe, and field man Mike Rich, the Dutchmen spiksters have become one of the few college pawerhouses in the state. This reversal in Union's track fortunes was most evident in the team's showings in the final two meets of the indoor campaign. In the March 13th Union Invitational, the Gamet amassed an amazing 31 ~ points, good for third place in the nineteen tea)ll field. One week later the tracksters did even better, culminating their season with a phenomenal seco·nd place showing in the State Championships. In the im :tational meet, the Roundup Gamet entered and exited wit.h · ~ctories. Greg Hamlin, John Braham, Mark Mindel, and Tim McCabe provided the initial thrills for the partisan crowd, with their thrilling win in the two- mile relay event. Hamlin and: Mindel recorded the fastest· splits, each clocking 2:02 for their half mile legs. The meet ended on a familiar note, the mile relay quartet once again making short order of their competition. AI Prysunka, Steve Wood, the tireless McCabe, and Rick Jaszczak finished more than tWenty yards ahead of their nearest opponents. Jaszczak and McCabe, incidentally, also copped a second and third in the 600 yard run. The duo would have finished in the first and second sp.ots, but they did not know that a runner in another heat had run an exeeptionally fast time .. Consequently, the two runners eased up in the final yards of their race - hoping to conserve their energy for later events. · Ed Rossi and 1000 yarder ·Alliance., D Phi Tops by JIMMY NAISMITH The Intramural Basketball Association released its final statistics recently, and officially declared the Black Alliance winners in Coach Art Lawrence's loop~ The Alliance team sported a perfect 12-0 slate, including a tight 45-43 win over a Mike Sachs-coached team in the playoffs - a victory which gave the winners the league Rugby Opens Next Week Union's Rugby Club opened its 1971 spring season this week with daily workouts, in preparation for the ruggers' season opener next Saturday afternoon, April 10, against Albany Medical College. The Gamet, led once again this spring by co-captains Bob Teitenen and Howie Goldberg and sporting new uniforms, will be looking to shake a three year old winless skein which has seen the ruggers fail to win in every contest since the spring of 1968. This spring the Gamet will play a four-game schedule, finishing the season by competing in the May 15 New England Rugby Football Union Tourilament at the University .of Massachusetts.

The Alliance squad had ear-lier dissipated an eight;..point advantage down the stretch. Other members of the squad were Ken Jacoby, Charles Tucker, Larry Sykes, and Bart Conrad (the Jatter two missing the championship contest). Sach's team, although choking somewhat in their fmale, still deserves commendation of some sort. Standing out for them during the course of the season were high-scorer and playiililker Marty Berman, Neil Meisel, Lee Meisel, Alex Utecht, and Frank Messa ( the lone s~ing, renmant of Sach's 0-6 squad of a year ago). \Wait until next year\ is now the cry being heard from this Cinderella team.

Both teams made it through theil' respective divisions unscathed to reach · the finals. Delta Phi, though, did have trouble in their -division from Tim Foley's independent team, defeating that fine squad by three points in a decisive battle. 0 Phi, with their vaunted full-court press, is rapidly emerging as U- Coll's own UCLA dynasty, albeit on the intramural level.

The rebounding crown was captured by Timmy Moran ·of the West College Nads, while Lou Kinter and Steve Manus shared the foul- shooting title. Hamlin also contributed to the team effort. R()ssi was just edged out in the 60 ya.rd hurdles, while Hamlin finished in 4th. place;.just .4 of a second behind the winner.

The second place showing was accomplished· despite the fact that most of the Gamet were suffering a physical let~down after an arduous week of exams. In addition, Mike Rich, one of the favorites in the high jump, was feeling the effects of a early season injury: Finally; the se~ond place finish. was accomplished in the face of an uncompromising fate, which snatched the baton out of Tim McCabe's hand in his leg of the one mile relay.

Within the last two weeks, however, the Department of Arts has been granted the opportunity to expand its ranks due to the increasing demand for more courses. Professor Edgar <;urtis, Chairman of the department and Music Professor, gratefully explains this addition as the result of the recognition by the administration that the faculty in the Department have been carrying double overloads of courses, and the fact that over 100 students were denied courses in music and drama this semester. The Department has decided that the fuH-time position will be split to allow the hiring of two part-time instructors. Prof. Curtis defends this decision by emphasizing that the college sorely needs an instructor in stage design and construction and for organizing the wind instrument musicians on campus. He adds that there is little chance of finding one person with suitable credentials in both those fields. Curtis explains that there are few instructors from the faculties of the tri-city area colleges with enough free time to take this job, so that for an outside instructor to be lured, there must be a more lucrative plan to offer than a part- time position. He hopes that the past overwhelming enthusiasm of the students interested in the two areas will attract \really first- class men.\ The decision for part-time instructors will enable Union Students to receive an arts degree with emphasis in drama, which is not offered at present because of the lack of sufficient faculty in that field.

i I n n g y f To the Editor: In this day of dissent and disruptit:m littie acts of kindness and · compassion take on .a,i;J. importance that reaches far beyond those immediately involved and deserves mention before a larger public. Last Saturday just such · an occurence took place and none of the nine of us present shall soqn forget. A beautiful spring day and a young man's fancy turns to softball; indeec;l, lower campus· fields were covered and a group of hopefuls from Davidson· House wandered beyond the gym to the outfield of the ball diamond for an afternoon of youthful enterprise.. How can I describe the field? A mecca for weekend boaters perhaps? We hoped to ;play at least several innings before the tide came in. Bqt alas a gray automobile stopped and at a great distance in frotit, of the gym, a somber, dark- coated man, a cigar directing the doubting to his mouth, appeared, and a voice was heard to say, 'get off the field.' Standing in front of hi$ running automobile this leader of atheletes watched us trek toward the field house with the feelings of respect and warmth students everywhere have to come to have for wise decision, fairly reached and eloquently expressed. We had walked quite a distance when the · gentleman trusted us not to attempt a refording of the cinder· moat .p:rotectilig his domain. As we neared the bridge over Hans Groots Kill the gray auto approacbed from behind and came into our midst. With an abrupt honk of the horn we were summoned, awe fell over us and we wondered what this man, this man who we had put through so much, this man who we had made to stop his car, get out of it, stand up and raise his voice, whose irrigation project we had ruined, would now say to us. We knew, in our heatts, he was right, that no forrrt of castigation would be too severe, no extent .of reproach inappropriate. But our anxiety was in vain, for this much-wounded man, as he rolled down his window, .going through god-knows-what contortions to reach it from the driver's side, inquired, sensing our collective crises of identity, 'who do you think you are?' Of course,. like other wanders in history we were unable to answer but thankful for the acute and insightful phrasing of the question. Coming as it did, when we expected otherwise, we were doubly gn~teful. · We were too dumbfounded with worship to manage to comprehend the remainder of his convel'sation during those few precioqs moments he spent among us. Perhaps someday we will be able to sort out the high and noble . message that surely lies vital and articulate among his · closing words to us. Unfortunately, in our confusion, in our humility and, alas, in our youth we rriistook them for a disjointed collection of grunts, half-sentences ·and coughing sounds. We only hope that as the events of this day grow further away from us - the impact of its message will not diminish. God is not dead - he's calling for a hit and run Bill Dugi, '71 Dear Sir, After careful consideration I have decided that I will not be a' candidate for reelection as· President of the Student Pody. I have represented the Student Body in discussions with the administration for. a comparatively long time, and I feel that student particjpation will be strengthened by new leadership. I am deeply grateful for having the opportunity to serve for one. year as Vice President of the Stuaent Body and for one year as President. I hope that I ~have fulfilled the trust which has been placed in me. . Althou,gh I will .\lOt hold a formal office after May 1st, I will continue to speak aut on issues of concern to Union students, because I believe in Union and I believe in student participation. I feel that the student role in govemance of the college has grown considerably over the last two years. I look forward to its continued growth. Sincerely, Walter A. Spencer, Jr. * * * * To the Editors: MEDITATION At this time I would like to · formally announce my candidacy for the office of president of the student body. During the next three weeks I hope to be able to speak with all members of the Union community and discuss what tl:tey feel are the important campus issues at this time.

With the conclusion of the last lecture series, the Union chapter of the Students International , Meditation Society reports that there are 160 meditators in the Schenectady area.

The point is well taken. The problem is not, however, the basis for publication of non-student material. While the Idol's primary function is to serve as a forum for student writers, it is not published solely for the use of that small group of students. The magazine aspires to serve the added function of pleasing those who enjoy reading. With the hope that there are individuals at Union who wish to read, it is the editorial policy of the Idol to publish literature and art related -to Union College, whethet created by st11dent, faculty member, or alumnus.

Professor Manfred Jonas, ChairmQ;n of Division II, moved the amendment calling for the 3-1 faculty student ratio; it had previously been approved by the Student Senate, the. All College Council, and Division II. Professor Jonas noted that' student representation has already been J;Ilandated within the . History , Department, - and that it has been \very hefpful.\ Student Senate President Walter Spencer spoke of the need to provide an atmosphere which encourages student participation. He assured the faculty that ''political power (for . the students) is not the intent of this proposal.'' . However, there were some who opposed the proposed change. Professor John Roulier stated that he sees \no real value\ in having more than two student representatives within any department. Yet when this amendment was put to a vote it was approved by a decisive margin, perhaps 2•1. The faculty then dealt with another amendment to Proposal #4, one which states. that when there is more than one student representative within a department, both the junior and senior classes will he represented. Professor Gardner Ketchum suggested an addition to the amendment, providing that in departments in which three student representatives are required one representative should be a graduate student, assuming of course that graduate students are workirtg within those departments. Both the main amendment and Professor Ketchum's revision were approved. Professor Theodore Bick moved. another amendment, stating that student representatives be elected in the Spring for the following academic year; this also carried. At · this point, the amended version of Pl7oposal #4 was ap.proved by the Gerteral Faculty. Proposal #5, which is concerned with changing the MOUNTEBANKS TRYOUTS (AUDITIONS) .

The Treaty's text is concluded with this rather ambiguous statement: \By ratifying the agreement, we pledge to take whatever actions are appropriate to implement the terms of this joint Treaty and to insure its acceptance by the government ofthe United States.\ Student Senators present at Tuesday's meeting were also given copies of the U.S. State Department's official reaction to the People's Peace Tre~ty. After a point-by-point denunciation of the terms of the Treaty, the State Department response concludes thusly: \'The Communist response has been an adamant refusal to engage in discussions on a peace settlement unless their demands are accepted in advance ... It is this position which those who want peace should try to change:\ After preliminary de bate, Student Senate President Walter Spencer ruled that the Senate did not hiwe the authority to take an official stand on this Treaty issue. Spencer's decision was appealed to the floor, and overridden by a vote of 18-8, the two-thirds majority having been attained. Further discussion followed, culminating in a decision to table (or delay) action on the Peace Treaty in order that the Senators have more time for thought. In other business, the Senate passed a motion calling for a new adviser system for freshmen. The proposal recommends \that a group of 30 facultv members be chosen from volunteers to act as freshmen advisers.

Two boxes will be placed on each floor of the dorms. One will be for paper material, the other for the cans. Students are asked to place only newspapers and magazines in the paper receptacles at the present time. It would also be appreciated if students would wash out cans and remove any paper labels from them before depositing them. It is asked that no materials other than thse specified he placed in the receptacles. Stations will also be maintained in each of the fraternities on campus. The Inter- Fraternity Council is helping to promote recycling at the houses. The faculty also · will he able to recycle paper, as receptacles will be set up in the vicinities of the faculty offices. Stations are also to be set up in Lamont House, in the Administration Building, and at othet strategic locations on campus. Receptacles for cans will also be placed next to each of the soda machines on campus. ~he Spring Term is being designated as a test period to determine the practicality of recycling on campus. If successful, PYE hopes to initiate the project as a year-round effort, possibly including glass as a material to be recycled. As a project like this needs a definite amount of manpower, persons willing o help in any way are asked to contact John Hakkinen in 311 Davidson (346- 9422) or Steve Arnira in 257 Fox. Social Action Protests War By To~ Mitchell John Kauffman, Albany spokesman for the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice, met Monday night with the Social Action Committee to discuss a campaign against a local bank to protest American involvement in the Viet11am v.rar. Concerning Vietnam Kauffman said we are in a \critical situation\: there is still a need to show President Nixon that anger and frustration over the war is serious so that he will not he able to consi~er any stepped-up military activities in Vietnam. Of course, the primary goal of the campaign is to promote the total and immediate withdrawal of American troops from the area. Thus, the PCP J plans to march on the First Trust Co.. of Albany on April 30, designated as \SetUe Accounts Day.\ Choosing a hank, Kauffman stated, allows the protestors to direct pressure on those who · Have money - and therefore power. Specificially, The First Trust, a branch of the third largest bank in America, has large investments and exerts control over a number of defense contractors involved in warfare production. Thus, the originators of the campaign hope it will 'bring the war home' to people in Continued on Page 6

Current station members Dennis Fazio and Bob Ditter, working with Union alumnus Bill . Kern (class of '69), discovered the handicaps just last week as they were finishing the FCC application. ·One of the major difficulties is that two other concerns, radio stations W ABY of Albany and WQBK of Troy, 1s not enough to get the required signal density into Albany from the present proposed tower site.\ Since the FCC also requires the same density over the city where the studios are located, Schenectady would have· to ·be covered with a signal as dense as in Albany. Although the signal over both Albany and Schenectady would have been very strong. and very dear, the line for the density of signal necessary to gain FCC approval lies just outside of each city. WBU~ have already applied for the same Talk of an FM station at channel. Although applications Union was heard as early as are still being accepted by the 1956. \As a matter of fact,\ Bob FCC for this channel, allocation Ditter told Concordiensis, \we of the frequency (the last found an old transcript from the available channel .;~ •\~ ~-) will 1940's with mention of plans for . m the area .

The main proposal, put together principally difficulty, however, is not the by Ditter, Fazio, and Kern, was competition of the other accepted by the Board which applicants, but the fact thatthe authorized use of the Green fund frequency under consideration is ($50,000) for building such a assigned to Albany and not to station. \What bothers me,\ siad Schenectady. Bob Ditter Ditter, \is that when I first came explained that \this would mean to Union I heard a lot of talk that we would have to apply for from people then in charge of the frequency with our studios WRUC about an FM station, located in Albany rather than on but there was no action.

Confused again. Here comes aU this activity in Washington, in Albany, on the telephone ~ and, somehow, so much of it seems fucked up to me. Charlie Riech's The Greening of America had quite an effect on me, and I'm really getting down · on demonstrations .and yipping and, yowling (but not Yippie-ing, however). When I first heard about how \everybody\ was supposed to be going to · Wa$hington, I .got the strong feeling that this was just gonna be a flabby stab in the dark to \do something\ after a long peried of inactivity; after all; how can people know that we're still sincere.if we're not in the streets, right? Besides, it would be the social event of the season. Well, I don't quite feel that way now. There are .two Wdshington trips scheduled (a week apart; I hope th.e activities · . themselves are better planned than the dates chosen for them - how many people are going to feel disposed to troop to D.C twice in two weeks, old revolutionary planners, there?). The first trip - · especially in light of the surprising (to me, at least) present mood of the country - seems good.. Xhe philosophy underlying the April 24 march is this: Nixon is getting backed into a corner in Vietnam ~ he must eitheF find a quick military solution or get out. Quoting from the statement by the Student and Youth National Coordinating Committee: \his ~ilitary options are limited to invasion of North Vietnam, saturation b~mbing of the North ... or using tactical nuclear weapons to seal off the Ho Chi Minh trail and the DMZ. Clearly, it is our responsibility to insure that he can choose none of these military ~lternatives; to do this, we must act now.\ In other words, the April 24 actidn is designed to turn out an incredible mass of bodies to let Richard Nixon know that he's gonna catch unimaginable shit if he militarily escalates in Southeast Asia. I sorta think this is a good idea. A 'Week ago, J wouldn?t have; I was, in fact, calling it counterproductive. But, very suddenly, America has changed a KRISE bit. .My God, the SST got ·defeated. Everyboyd in the world is calling for J. Edgar Hoover's resignation. And perhaps most important ef aU - peeple of every political persuasion are outraged by the handling of the Lt. Calley affair~ The people ~ all.of them,. I think - are finally becoming aware of the lies our alleged government has been IE~.ying down, and I think the time may be right for the Peace Movement to ·~mce again become hyper-visible and oQce again say to everyone in this land-mass, humbly and sincerely, ••Join u.s.'' ·· . The stuff plE~.nned for May, however, is not too cool. I know, I know - this is supposed to be what the Vietnamese people want, they want a mass demonstration of support in early May. Okay, but why do ya have to try to close down the whole flaming city of Washington? That, in a word, kidd.ies, is dumb. Yet, that's what's on the agenda for May 3 and 4. May 1 · is fine - it's a celebration of the signing of the People•s Peace Treaty, and that's really far out. May 2 is pretty much devoted to . telling the gumrnint to ratify the People's Peace Treaty or else we're gonna shut down the city for the next two days.

The National Student Association (NSA) sponsored the THE PEOPLE'S PEACE TREATY 'treaty at a meeting last August, as it was decided that anti-war forces needed a new focal. point because legislation had failed. Although nine student-body presidents and six college editors were chosen to negotiate with students of North and South Vietnamese student unions, Doug Hostetter, a 26-year-old Mennonite pacifist chosen as interpreter (he had taught English for two years at Tam Ky) was the only one to go to Saigon because the others were denied visas by· the South Vietnamese embassy and wound up in Hanoi. . In the ten days Hostetter spent in Saigon in December, he noted a rise in inflation, dissent, and overt anti-Amerikanism from his previous .stay. He found that the South Vietnamese student union had published,. a tnonth earlier, a declaration similar to the NSA's tentative plan demanding immediate and total withdrawal of American forces. As the Vietnamese consider Vietnam to be one coUntr-y, no ca:l1 was made for North Vietnamese withdrawal from South Vietnam. Policemen who searched Hostetter's bags for \i.lJegal documents\ during his two-day stand in Laos claimed proudly, We search just like they do in the U.S. - I was trained in Fort Knox.\ Fi~ally, Hostetter joined the other fifteen delegates for eight days in Hanoi. The group was received by Prime.. Minister Phom Van Dong and his words: ·\Why can't we all be friends?\ The treaty calls for prompt and total withdrawal of U.S. Be it known that the American and Vietnamese people are not enemies. The war is carried out in the names of the people of the United States and South Vietnam but without our consent. It destroys the land and people of Vietnam. It drains America df its resources, its youth and its honor. . We hereby agree to end the war on the following terms, so that both peoples can live under the joy of independence and can devote themselves to building societies based on human equality and respect for the earth. 1. The Americans agree to immediate and total ~ithdrawal from Vietnam and publicly to set the date by which all American forces will be removed. The Vietnamese pledge that as soon as the U.S. Government publicly sets a date for total withdrawal: 2. They will enter discussions to secure the release of all American prisoners,\ including pilots captured· while bombing North Vietnam. 3. There will be an immediate cease-fire between U.S. forces and those led by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam. 4. They will enter discussions of the procedures to guarantee the safety of all withdrawing troops. 5. The Americans pledge to end the imposition of the Thieu- Ky-Khiem on the people of South Vietnam in order to insure their right of self-determination and so that all political prisoners .can be released. 6. The Vietnamese pledge to form a provisional coalition government to organize democratic elections. All parties agree to respect the results of elections in which all South Vietnamese can participate freely with out the presence of any foreigp troops. 7. The South Vietnamese pledge to enter discussion of procedures to guarantee the safety and political freedom of those South Vietnamese who have collaborated with the U.S. or with the U.S.-supported regime. . 8. The Americans and Vietnamese agree to ·respect the mdependence, peace and neutrality of Laos and Cambodia in accord with the 1954 and 1962 Geneva conventions and not to interfere in the internal affairs of these two countries. 9. Upon these points of agreement, we pledge to end the war _and resolve all other questions in the spirit of self-determination and mutual respect for the independence and political freedom of the people of Vietnam and the Um~ed States.

TERM PAPERS TYPED IN MY HOME I DO ANY KIND OF TYPING PLEASE CALL CENTRAL BRIDGE-868..,2029 by ALAN COHEN During the winter I was very concerned about the possibility of my getting drafted and being for~d to leave the country, go underground, spend thousands of dollars in court cases or any number of unpleasant alternatives to the most unpleasant of aU - the United States army and all it brings with it. . . It was a period of extreme egocentricity ~ seJf..,concern. Being with friends who talked about their futures in medical school or love problems was not easy, because, to me, anyone else's problems were too trivial. 13ut suddenly, it seems that I will not be drafted. It's not definite but it looks pretty good for me. So I am baclc to my old care.., free but caring self. After weeks of worrying about myself and' denouncing everything that caused me to be in such an absurd sit\lation, it might be the natural reaction to just tty and enjoy life for a while. However, it is rather apparent to me thM wha·t I struggled through goes on daily in every state of the Union plus Puerto Rico in families that cannot afford doctors' letters or court cases or even to leave the country. Not only are students facing the draft, but married rrren with children and pacifists. who never ·had \training\ to qualify them for conscientiqus objection are as well. · I do not te!J.Uy have to discuss. the inequities of the draft nor the absurdities of the Indochinese War. Everyone knows them. What I want to talk about is what we are doing about them. It is easy to ignore h all, but the words of an old Phil Ochs song come to mind: Show me a prison, show me ·a jail, Show me a'prison man whose face is growing pale And I'll show you a young man with so many reasons why There but for f~trune go you and l Fortune, for a senior at Union College, could be his high lottery number or his asthma he had when he was a kid. Fortune could be being born a female. Fortune makes one able to go to law school when his friend is worrying about prison. And there are prisons in this country keeping not only those who robbed and stole for greed, or to keep their children fed, ·butthosewhohavebeen forced into prison for their refusal to take part in the army- to perpetuate the biggest crime of all. And there are Black men and women who have become revolutionarie.s because the 9thet ways have failed. They too are in jail or, in the case of quite a few Panthers, they are dead. April 24 is the day all 'the liberal groups are getting together in Washington D.C. to show the President they oppose the War. A week later the people are coming in for May Day to claim the land. ''If the government w.on't stop ~he war, then we'll stopthe government!\ So, there are two chances to act ~ with the liberals and with fhe radicals. I'm not saying that either group is going to accomplish an end to the war (which is iust the beginning to changing what is really wrong with the United States).And I'm not saying that you .have to go down there to accomplish something o.f even that you have to accomplish anything at alL . , . .

The Dutchmen will have to' wait until Tuesday afternoon, Apnl 13, before they have another chance to play. The Garnet open at home Tuesday against the Bantams of Trinity, with gametime at 3:30 p.m. on Daley Field. The snow-out at Stevens wiU in all probability reduce the Garnet's schedule to a mere nine games. Stevens is now on their spring vacation, so it will be virtually impossible to make up the game during the near future. The Stutemen leads the Stevens-Union lacrosse series, begun in 1925, with 19 wins, II losses, and three ties. The Garnet won last year's game easily, 13-1, but an improved Stevens club and Union's limited practice time outside Memorial Field House figured to make Wednesday's contest a toss-up. by MARTY BERMAN For Union baseball fans this year will not be the year of the scorecard. Anyone keeping score or even mildly following the game may begin to belit<_ve he's had one or so too many before Hoop Names Jim Tedisco Jim Tedisco, who in two ;:arsity seasons holds every Union College scoring record, has been elect~d capatin .of the 1971-72 Dutchman basketball team. The 5-7 junior from Schenectady led Union to 18 victories in 21 games this winter, most wins ever in· the 71-year history of . intercollegiate basketball competition at the college. Reporter Finds Happiness At Art Lawrence's Office by LEAPIN' Monday's baseball practice at the Field House, with Concordy's man-on-the-scene present: Coach Lawrence, se~ing the newcomer, seized the opportunity and barked, \All right! What freshman here knew me before September? As no one dared to move, the timid voice of the reporter was heard to say, \Er excuse me, but I'm not Leapin' Leiderman!\ But coach Lawrence got his chance the following day, for I arrived at his office promptly at I :00. He put me on the defensive. At the same time, he indicated the thoroughness with which he'd done his homework. How? He pointed out that I'd had good Board scores and should be a 3.0 student but have little better than a 2.0 cum. He said that such often is the case with baseball players. An I 8-year-old high school star often hits against younger pitchers, some of whom can't throw curveballs, artd th_us fattens his average; but as a freshman in college, he's the rookie. Lawrence cited past illustrative cases and made his point. All the while, he emphasized that in just three sessions of hitting, fielding, and running (the three have equal weight in his selecting process), he can pick his team. That's plausible only in light of t·he man's 30-plus years of experience and, I might add, success. He impressed me further by producing a complete list of this year's participants in tryouts. If Lawrence didn't ask for one's name directly, he got it from someone else. He admittedly uses ' the advice of two or three veteran players oh the team but makes his own final decisions. Indeed, Coach Lawrence added; this year's tryouts were the shortest ever. The reasons are unbelievable but true - the basketball court in the Field House was not removed while Gamet post-season basketball fortunes were up in the air; also, Lawrence did miss two practices - he had the Out Additionally, the coach wouldn't allow his batters to swing h:trd until after a week of practicing. The circumstantial unfortunate fact remains that first cuts came within that first week, leaving many of those dropped quite unhappy. A 25-m<m team is impractical. Lawrence said that bench- warmers always complain about their limited or non-existent playing time; thus, he can't afford to keep a good hitter who would only pinch-hit once ot twice all year. (Nor can the college afford it, on its limited budget.) Lawrence would love a freshman team, but there's only one diamond on which to practice and only one time for practice each day - roughly, from 4 to 6 in the afternoon. Lawrence asked me if there is anything rm happy about, and that gave me the feeling of playing the famous part of the have-nots vs. the .;haves. In addition to the baseball situation, the athletic department's limited budget is felt elsewhere: The basketball courts in the gym are usually overcrowded, and while rumors abound concerning outdoor courts, time passes and there's still no change. It just goes to show, in the Rolling Stone's words, that you can't always get what you want. \ ... but if you try sometime, yvu just might find you get what you need.\ It gives me some satisfaction to report that baseball players were asked, not told, by one Coach Art Lawrence, to get haircuts.

Riker, former Vice-President of the American Po~itical · Science Associatio~, dehvered an appeal last Thursday evening to make political science more scientific by abandoning the behavioralist model of politics and substituting a system he dubbed the .. New Rationalism\. Dr. Riker, who is the chairman of the Department of Political Science at the University of Rochester, stated that \much of what passes as science in political science is not very scientific at alL\ He indicated, however, that behavioralsim has served a useful purpose in aiding the development of political science. Frank Presents Beethouen Sonatas Riker pointed out that in the 1930's the method .of analysis used by political scientists was very legalistic in nature. The 1930 political scientist analyzed the internal content of a law and expected the real world to reflect the content of the law. Furthermore, the 1930's political scientist was very reform minded.

The program will begin at 8:30 p.m. in Memorial Chapel. Born in Germany, Frank came to the United States at the outbreak of World War II .and studied in New York under master pianist Artur Schnabel. After a summer of performing undet Rudolf Serkin at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont, he devoted himself entirely to the concert stage. In 1956, he made his first European tour, and three years later made debuts with both the New York Philharmonic, under Leonard B.:;rnstein, and the Boston Symphony, under Charles Munch. To mark the 200th anniversary of Beethoven's birth, he has perfonned all 32 Beethoven sonatas during the past year. The sonatas have been recorded .by RCA.

On uThe Marionette Theater\ BY ESTELLE COOKE Professor Hans Freund a:t an informal lecture Thursday night April 8, expounded and elaborated on his \Afterword\ of \The Marionette Theater.\ Heinrick Von Kleist's ·story was translated by Ruth Parker and was published in the last issue of the IDOL Professor Freund empahsized the importance of Kleist's Romanticism. Romanticism was defined as \victory of imagination over matter.\ The underlying assumption is that \reality is undefined.\ Professor Freund tried to establish a distinction between a parable and an allegory. Freund concluded by saying that the point of the story \can not be logically defined but is lett to the imagination of the reader.\ A number of questiohs on ,different aspects of \The Marionette Theater\ came from the group of about twenty five students.

The lively discussion lasted for over an hour and a .half. The staff of the IDOL was very pleased to have Professor Freund speak on \The Marionette Theater.\ At the same time, the lDOL wishes to ask you to contribute as soon as possible your literary work for its next issue. There will be an IDOL meeting April 14, on the second floor of the old Schenectady Library. and that the system that behavioralism has created is too mechanical in nature; the idea of interest is absent from behavioralism. \The behavior- .alist approach deprives the individual of his own will, and for that reason is inhumane.\ Dr. Riker also faulted behaviotalism on the grounds that it tends to be anti-theoretical in nature. He indicated that a scientific approach should move from basic axioms to the development of a model to the testing of this model by means of experimentation. Riker claimed that behavioralism doesn't do this and that it is inductive in nature. He further stated that \inductive procedures are a waste of time, and in that in the absence of a theory a hypothesis does not prove anything.\· To replace behavioralism, Dr. Riker proposed a system he called the \New Rationalism\ .. This system has three basic axioms. The first axiom is that \people have goods and will pursue them.\ Riker indicated that this is different from behavioralism because behavioralism does not attribute anything to the individual. The second. axiom is that \people are capable of ordering their preferences\. The third. and final axiom of the theory is that \people are able to choose from the alternatives before them those alternatives that maximize their goals\. Professor Riker felt his proposed system was better than the behavioralist approach because in the \Rationalist\ approach \human beings behave as if they have calculated the probabilities of the outcome of their actions\. He Went on to say that \this model assumes that people can make complex judgments, and that people are rationalists\. Riker indicated that the . rationalist system he proposed was different from the rationalist system of Plato or Hobbes. Plato and Hobbes, said the speaker, specified the goals of the individual. He does not do this in his system. This is why he called his system the \New Rationalism\. Political Action Forum Exhibits M_uch Conflict BY PETER DICKERMAN Ending in a state of general confusion and ·frustration, the political action meeting held Monday night. in Memorial Chapel served to illustrate the divisiveness existing within the present anti-war movement. Skip Mowry began the session with the statement that Vietnam \is Richard Nixon's War now,\ and he'added that the forthcoming demonstrations should make this fact clear. A variety of activities sponsored by diverse groups are planned to occur between April 24 and May 5, involving both marches ori Washington and loc;tl action in the Capital District. Professor David Snider spoke briefly concerning the April 24 march to the nation's capital, which apparently is receiving broadly based support. This massive, legal demonstration was described by Snider as an important indicator of national anti-war sentiment. Buses to Washington will be leaving from the Schenectady Peace Center at 12:45 am on Saturday, April 24, and should return to this city on the following morning. Seats on the buses cost $13, and those interested should contact Prof. Snider, Next to speak was John Kauffman, who possesses the title of Albany State SP.okesman for the {»eople's Coalition for Peace and Justice .. :k.auffmim talked of the campaigrt being waged against the First Trust Company of Albany, a branch Of Banker's Trust. These activities are supposed to culminate in a \Settle Accounts bay\ on April 30, in which the coalition en masse will visit the Albany bank to \discuss policies.\ In Kauffman's view, the Vietnam War continues only because it is profitable for certain corporations, and that the First Trust project is intended to hasten public realization of this fact. The following are the three basic demands of the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice: immediate American withdrawal from Vietnam; freeing of all political prisoners; and a $6500 minimum annual family income. Professor Dennis Peskin spoke to the rather sparse audience on his opinions of the activities. He refused to support the April 24 March, describing it as in many ways \reactionary\ in character, while praising the bank action because \it locates the enemy for the people.\ Peskin gave his strong support to the early May Washington activities, which are to involve \militant non-violent civil disobedience.\ The majority of the session's time was seemingly spent in a type of intellectual fratricidal warfare, with much revolutionist rhetoric and several heated exchanges, particulary between a contingent of Maoists and representatives of the People's Coalition. At one stage Professor Snider admonished those present that the meeting should not \degenerate into a debating society.\ Ironically, while there were repeated claims that the building. of a proadly based coalition . is essential to the movement, the gathering was marked by strong differences in tone and tactics.

Travel is great, it clears out the cobwebs and chases away t11e spider:s ... and, mostly, it helps you to get yourself together, t9 learn to depend on yourself and - at the same time ~ to learn how beautiful people are. Okay. So 1 hope everybody's up for hitting the road. Herewith, some tips/ rules jo bserva.tions that I hope will help make your journey an easier and more pleasant one.

I would like to make a few comments regarding· membership on the Treasury Committee. The current Secretary, Paul Van Camp, will automaticaily become Chairman as provided for in the Constitution. In addition, the Vice-President of the Student Body sits on the Cemmittee, ex officio. Thus there are two positions for which applications are being accepted. One is open only to a current Sophomore to serve as Secretary in his Junior year and then become Chairman as a Senior. The other position is member-at-large. This is for a one year term and is open to any Freshman, Sophomore or Junior, not just a Junior as stated in the last Concordy. It should be noted that the bulk of the Committee's work is done during the Fall Term. In the best sense of the word, Walt is a superb politician. He deeply understands the aspirations of his constituents, keeps in touch with them, informs them of what's .going on; he leads by persuasion and hard work. In the· ·committee, Walt was an untiring advocate of student rights, while· at the same time he was also sensitive to the legitimate needs of other groups. Above all, he was effective, and he was effective because he could settle for less than ·\complete: victory.\ Whatever merits students find in the governance report are in good part dQe. to Walt Spencer's determination, skills, and tempered judgment.

As I will soon be completing my term as Chairman, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the leaders of all student activities for their cooperation Charles Gati Department of Political Science stop and pick you up. Including cops,. who are always the last people to catch on to any trend. The best way to get a ride is to be a girl. However, there are some things in this world m_ore important than getting from one place to another, so if You're a girl, it's cool to have a ·guy along (even if he hides in the bushes). If you're a guy, dress up like a gi-rl. Then, when you're safely in the car, remove your disguise, so the driver won't get any funny ideas which can only end in frustration for the both of you. If the driver gets pissed off 'cause you'vetrickedtim, gi~Vehim the old \sexist pig\ rap and shame him into giving you money. In fact, if enough guys start dressing like girls When they hitch. the drivers'll get all uptight about trying anything with anybody, and it'll be safe for girls to hitch alone. Then again, the drivers might just. give up stopping for anybody. Flying: If you have the brea.;f, flying is the absolute best way to get from one place to another, · unless it;s froin one side of a small room to the other side, in which case We refer you to either A Child's Garden of Grass, or George Reeves' autobiography. By all means, get yourself a youth card (and if you're over 22, lie, or steal one). Using a youth card means you have to fly stand by, which can be a royal pain-in- the-ass; unless you know how to ·handle it. The first thing to remember is to avoid any flil!ht likely to be popular. A void like the We're close to a cure for leukemia~·-:·:-·''· Tht> cnemv. And we'll be damned if we're giving it away! We've busted chops too long for too little, and now that we've got the cure, you cheap bastards are going to pay through the nose for it. Now pay attention: ifyou're not too excited about wasting away to a swizzle stick, place $500,000 in a hollow tree just outside .of Bayonne, N.J.

So if you want to find out how full a flight is, call the airline information and ask when they have flights leaving for wherever you want to go, even if you already know when the plane leaves. The operator will giye you the times, and then ask if you wish to make a reservation: Tell her that you•ve never flown before, that you're a student and have heard about standby and would she please explain it to you. She'll give you the song about youth card, etc., and how standby doesn't make reservations. Then ask her how full the flight looks. I know this is a lot of shit to go through, but if you just ~I up and• ask what your chances. of gettmg on are, . most airlines have been known to lie and· say it. looks good, ·ev.en if they know it's full; it's to their advantage to have you waiting to fill in if a full-price fare doesn't show up . .But if you come on as a Rule number two: Dope is the universal means .of exchange; carry a small amount with you and lay some on people you want favors from (note: this does not apply to cops Who are busting yoq for hitching). Driving: Great for shprt trips, especially over New England roads, especially in a sports car (note: remember, Jackie Stewart knows more than you do). Take along somebody as a navigator to read the maps. and tell you where to turn, and to help pay all tolls, gas, and fines. If you see peaple hitching, stop for them, -they probably have dope. Rule number three: Always carry a checkbook with you; this provides you with unlimited amounts · of bread ·if an emergency hits you - like the need for food or shelter. It's irrelevant how much is in your account - when your parents hear you've been writing rubber checks, they'll cover them to save their own reputations .

The luckless Union Rugby Club slogged to its first defeat of the spring season Saturday, battling a bigger Albany Med squad on even terms for much of the match before succumbing in the mud and snow, ll-3. The loss lengtht:ned a seemingly never- ending three year Union non- · winning streak. Because the sloppy playing conditions made running, passing, and ball handling aU but impossible, Saturday's: contest was left to be decided by the two serums. A I ba ny' s burley scrummers pushed the smaller Garnet players around ail afternoon, winnning possession of the ball time and again on loose serums and lineouts. The Garnet started fast in Saturday's match, and for a time outplayed and outhustled the bigger Albany players. Med scored first, however, converting a penalty kick from about twenty yards· straight out. to take a 3-0 lead mieway through the first half. Union stormed back later in the half to tie the score with a three-point try, after carrying play deep into Albany territory. After a quick-footed Garnet player booted the ball out of a tangle of players toward the Med goal, co-captain Bob Teittinen outraced a trio of Albany defenders to fall on the loose ball in the end zone. Union settled .. for the three points when Garry Lynch's conversion attempt from a severe angle fell short. The half ended with the score knotted at 3-3. The two squads continued to slug it out during the early moments of the second stanza, with Med continuing to dominate play in the serums and lineouts. Albany broke the tie with eleven minutes left in the game, when the Garnet defenders were slow in fielding a rolling, bouncing kick deep into their own territory. A pair of Med players covered the ball jvst over the goal line for the try. The conversion kick ftom Tennis Hopes Dampened The fortunes of Union's tennis tearn, looking for its first winning season in nine years, have been dam,pened by the loss of one of its most promising players, . but Coach Gary Walters still feels that the netmen have a shot at their best record since 1962. Marty Cuk ierman, an extremely promising freshman, is suffering from mononucleuosis and should be lost for the season. Without Cukierman, who would have played first or · second single, the rest of the squa.d will have to play that much harder if they hope to post a winning record. · Sophomore co-captain Stu Fishier is the top returnee from last year's 4-5 team, and he will undoubtedly handle the first singles chores in Cukierman's absence. Fishier is joined by returning lettermen Ken Groover, who finished last spring with the best singles mark, 5-3; sophomore co-captain Jim Skiff; and sophomores Bob Mandryanc Ernie Guillet. Three freshmen showing early season promise are Tim Moran, Rick Judd, and Dave Jones. The Dutchmen open their 11th match season tomorrow; April 1'4, at home against Bard College. directly in front. of the goal was fading wide when the baH struck the goalpost upright and feU over for the two extra points; Med added their final three points late in the game on a similar _-play to make the final score read ll-3. The Garnet face another tough rival next weel<:end when the ruggers travel to Albany to face Albany College of Law's rugby · club. Union will again be up against a severe size disadvantage, especia,lly in the serum.

It was the Garn~t's fi:rst real compeition, as they were snowed out of their opener with Middlebury last Saturday. That was the culmination of a limited spring practice which allowed the Dutchmen little time for real hitting or pitching practice in game situations the Ephmen simply.were better tuned and prepared, a. fact which was evident in their committing only one error and scoring the go-ahead run on a well-executed squeeze play. Union, of course, doesn't )lave the money· to send the squad· south for an exhibition season. An indication of how little money is spent on baseball is that the team is driving to all its aw~y games instead of riding the bus.

The weather has alot to do with what things smell like outdoors - like if you're standing downwind from General Electric or not. But, also, in things like the sort of ice- creamy c;mell in the air before it rains, or the ozone in the air after a thunderstorm.

The complex, when fully completed, will house 1he departments of biological sciences, chemistry, physics, psychology, mathematics, civil engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. The college's computer {;enter will also be located in the facility. The college's science and engineering pFograms currently enroll approximately 850 undergraduates or slightly better than half the student body. architectural firm, Walker 0. Cain Associates. The center was designed and built with clear span construction featuring d!-lep set steel girders rather than columns for support. · The interior construction _ was done in four foot modules so that the internal composition of the building could be reshaped in the future to meet changing demands on the facilit~. Currently, the new building includes 17 classrooms, six seminar rooms, 32 laboratories plus support facilities, and offices for 43 faculty members. These totals will significantly increase when the renovations of the other three buildings in the complex are completed next year.

Chris Kennedy commented on the other features which include a \two-scene pre-set.\ This device allows the ljghts to be set for the next cue while still lit for the current scene. A flick of a switch changes the setting. The new board has a safer \patch\ panel without any hot leads. \Everything is solid state and that leaves much less to be fouled up,\ Kennedy added. As for the old board, Steve said that there has been an offer of $50 for its transformers, but added that its future is still not definite, Katz also announced that the new hoard will make its debut with all 24 dimmers working at the opening performance of Att Buchwald's Sheep on the Runway. The performance is on May 13 and is by invitation only, to those people Who donated money for the light board. It will be followed by a reception. Asked about the invitations Katz stated, \We felt that this was the best way to thank a1l of the people for their generous help.\ Other performances of \Sheep\ will be on May 14, 15, 20, 21 and 22. \It was recently on Broadway with 104 performances, quite a long run consid~ring the season,\ Chris commented. The story is a satire on American Foreign Policy and will star. Bob Harders, Judy ·Steinbach, Barbara Michela and Spencer Gates. Other plans for this term ~ include the possibility of some one act plays, but nothing is scheduled yet Kennedy asked that anyone interested in working on the technical crew for \Sheep\ should contact ei'ther him at 370- 2676 or Elliott Bardsley in 311 Davidson. the AD HOC Committee on Drugs, and the Student Senate itself. When asked about his reasons for pursuing elective office, Robbins responded that politics is one of his major fields of interest, and further that his substantial past serVice attested to his committment. In another vein, Robbins stressed his desire to act as an agent of imwvation, while at the same time enhancing a sense of community among the students, faculty, administration, and staff. This last element of the College was mentioned by Robbins as one which deserves representation in the decision- making process, which it has been denied in the past. · On the issue of presumed student apathy toward campus politics, Robbins stated that \I would very much like to see someone running against everyone now on the ballot.\ While acknowledging some areas af disagreement with incumbent President Walter Spencer, Robbins asserted that \Walter has done a very good job.\ However, Robbins does believe that an infusion of new faces in government may help to .increase student. interest. The candidate described the Governance Report as \a fine piece of work\ whose passage he supports, but added that the Report tloes not go far enough along the path of granting students \an institutionalized voice\ on such matters as budgetary priorities. Discussing recent stude.nt dissatisfaction with admin- istrative actions. Robbins noted that . \l think we're getting away from paternalization,\ for the in loco parentis concept seems undeniably dead. In another matter, Robbins stated that the College is \part of the community,\ and he urged that we .. take the initiative\ in developing a spirit of reciporocity between Union and the immediate environment. In conclusion, Robbins made clear that he \thinks highly\ of the candidates for vice president and secretary, Marty Sherman and Dennis Fazio respectively. Commenting again on the barren electoral scene. Robbins asserted that \It would be too bad if I ran unopposed.\ Part of his feeling is -based on the belief that a competitive election would tend to result in a . more complete exchange of views. Whatever the situation on election day, Robbins asserted that his campaign is aimed at eliciting various student opinions, and that therefore he will contin.ue to have meetings and discussions with all those interested. Interviews with candidates Sherman and Fazio are scheduled to appear in forthcoming editions. Experiments in form Exhibited Color and in library by PATTY SIPE An Art Students' Exhibit currently on display in the entryway and music room in Schaffer Library features work done by students in Mrs. Bittleman's Color Classes and Prof. Erskine's Sculpture Class.

The exhibit will be on display The Color Studies in the music until the end of April. room are the work of two Color Classes. The first tertn of this sequence is offered as an Option Wells Obtains in Comprehensive Education as ~well as cour;e within the Art · Department. The Color Studies fall into two general categories, specific problems which Were assigned to the class and free studies based on these problems. The basic purpose of the course is to work with different colors and explore the different effects which may be produced by combining them in different ways. Among these effects are transparencies, the effect of cast light, color illusions, and the woven effect, which gives an appearance of depth and curves to flat studies. Also included in the exhibit are color studies which are done to resemble famous paintings. One of the requirements of the course was a 6 x 6' painting based on the Color Studies. The reactions to some of these paintings show that tl;ley did, in fact, create the desired impression. While viewing a Grant For Census Study Assistant professor of history, Robert V. Wells, has received an American Philosophical Society grant for research on the population of America before the Revolutionary War. Prof. Wells, a demograohv specialist, will spend three months in London this summer investigating British census efforts in America during the colonial period. The summer work is in preparation for an extended study Wells plans on demographic characteristics of the early American population. Prof. Wells joined the Union faculty in 1969. He is a graduate of Denison University and received his doctorate from Princeton University.

It's hard to beliew. but the heralded New York Knick dynasty in pro basketball is over - after only one year.

The 93-91 victory over New Yorl< is a particularly savory one for Baltimorons. who saw their Bullets mistreated · by the Knicks in both '69 and '70, their Colts tamed in 1969 by the Jets. and their Orioles clipped later that same year by the Mets.

The big, bad Bruins, professional hockey's Stanley Cup· champions, found themselves on the short end of a 4-2 decision Fight in front of 14,994 disbelieving patrons at the Boston Garden and millions of national television viewers. The Montreal Canadians, who know what dynasties are supposed to be, knocked off the highest scoring hpckey club ever with ~ combination of once and future greats, from Beliveau and Richard to Pete Mahovlh,:h and Dryden. As these things happen, the , Canadians weren't supposed to · win.

It meant power, person.ality, strength, 1md class, but most of all it meant length, If you were the best and proved it year after year, you qualified. A dynasty, in the traditional sense, however, has seen its day. Due to faire.r drafting regulations on new talent, which spread the wealth .more evenly in each sport, more teams find themselves with a chance at winn~ng a championship. The future may be filled with one year dynasties a la New York and Boston. Somehow, though, come World Series time, 1 don't think Oriole fans Beadle and Erlandson are going to buy that. .

CONCORDIENSIS, APRIL 20, 1971 Page 4 Concordy Sports Utica Edges Batsmen, 7-6 Stickers Overpowered- By Statesmen .Attack; Melt ·fDU ·Tomorrow by MARTY BERMAN Last. Thursday the Dutchmen baseballers dropped a tough 7-6 game to Utica College at the Pioneers' home park. Union spotted Utica a seven-run lead m the first four innings, and then spent. the remainder of the game chipping away at the margin only to fall one run short. The game was marred by a fight, involving Union players and Utica fans on· the sideline, as the contest Was concluded. The Garnet outhit the Pioneers 17-14, but were severely hindered with II men left on base. Dale LO!lrJ led the attack with four safeties. including a double. Bobby Bernhardt added three hits, including a double and a triple. with singles and Rick Arons produced one run with a sacrifice fly (his third RBI of the game). The rally di·ed after A I Westbrook singled, as the tying and go-ahead runs were stranded on the basepaths. The Dutchmen starter, Senior southpaw Larry Berkeley, was sadddled with the loss. He lasted into the third inning and was touched for eight hits and five earned runs, six tall\ies altogether. He was also hurt by wildness. Freshman Bucky Roulon-Miller replaced Berkeley on the hill and finished up fairly impressively, giving up one run on six hits in six innings. The fight that followed the game was the result of some distasteful remarks made· throughout the game by a gang of inebriated fraternity boys on the sidelines. The Utica players were embarrassed and not at all sad to see their \faithfuls'' pounded at the finish.

Ruggers Winll Score 6-3 Triumph Over Albany law By contrast, the Statesmen were well-tuned for Saturday•s· ,game, having won .fi.ve of seven previous contests. Hobart's attack, led by AU- American John 1'opichak, '''ent to work early on starting Garnet goaler Ed Green, tallying in the opening seconds of play and rolling up a 6-0 first qua-rter bulge. . · Green. who \froze up\ in the nets according to Allison and could make hut three saves, was yanked during the first half. in favor of backup Bob Erlandson. Erlandson contributed II stops, many of them spectacular, but the swarming Hobart attacks just could not be stopped by the Union defenders, Union went into the last inning trailing at 7-5, and they put on an old-fashioned N.Y. Mets finish. Mitchell and Long led off A long and frustrating winless streak finally came to an end for the Union Rugby Club oil Saturday, as the hustling ruggers downed an amazed Albany Law squad 6-3 for Union's first win in thre~· years'. The Garnet surprised Law by scoring early on Walt Witholt's 25 yard kick at goal. set up an Albany penalty. Union, almost as astonished as Albany at the early turn of events, took the 3-0 lead and hung on for dear life throughout the first half. ~spring Track Slate Opens The Union College track team will open its _spring campaign this Wednesday. facing a talented squad from Trinity in a 3:00 meet at Alexander Field. The Garnet will be fielding virtually the same team that finished second in the indoor State Chan1pionships this winter. Once again. Rick Jaszczak, Tim McCabe. and Mike Rich figure to be among the best in the state in their respective specialities. Jaszczak, an All- American track selection as a freshman two years ago, will see action in the 440 and mile relays and in the 220 and 440 yard runs. The diminutive McCabe will participate in various combinations of the following five events - the 440.880, mile, 440 yard hurdles, and mile relay. Rich. who was hampered through most of the indoor season with an injury, will be looking to break his own Union record in the high jump. The junior will also compete in the. javelin and discus throws. Despite their seeming strength, however. the Garnet will enter their season with somewhat guardeq expectations. First of all. the spikesters have had less than two weeks of running practice on their home \oval.\ To make matters worse.. the Dutchmen's Wednesday opponents will already have a meet under their belt. Finally, the cindermen seem to be jinxed by the Bantams ... never having beaten them quring the four year tutelage of Coach Ron Coleman. The key to the Union win had to be the inspired play of the Garnet serum. The Dutchmen depleted in the serum to begin with by injuries and outweighed at least 25 pounds per man figur~d to be hopelessly outplayed in crucial loose serums and lineouts, in addition to formal serums. But somehow the gutsy Dutchmen scrummers were able to battle the bigger, heavier Lawyers on nearly equal terms throughout the match. Albany rallied after Witholt's penalty kick, mounting a set of drives which carried the ball perilously,• close to Union's goal line time and again. However, in a series of crucial loose serums within the Union five yard lin~ the Garnet ganged up and managed either to throw Albany back or boot the ball upfield and out of trouble. The half ended with the Garnet still on top, 3-0. The Dutchmen came out fired up to start the secono stanza, and it wasn't long before they scored again. Wing Paul Martini tallied on an exciting 70 yard breakaway, kicking the ball out of tangle of players and racing after it downfield Martini was awarded a penjllty try after being obstructed by an Albany defender as he attempted to down the loose ball in the Law end zone. Witholt's conversion attempt ~- from directly in front of the goal posts went wide, with the Garnet settling for the astonishing 6-0 lead.

Coach Allison was understandably reluctant to' blame anypne in particular for the loss, the Garnet's 33rd defeat ai the hands of Hobart in 40 contests. \It was a learning-situation,\ he commented, .. and we didn't play too well on defense, attack, or in goaL We met a fine team too early in the season.\ .

Professor Charles Gati, who chaired th·e Governance _Committee, opened the session held Wednesday afternoon by making a motion to conside-r and vote on Proposals #1 through #S of the Report. This section contains the basic governance structures and procedures being proposed. In advocating an immediate show of support for the governance provisions, Professor Gati told of a center-oriented system. Prof. W. M. Scharz proposed that the question be postponed so that further consideration could be given to those options already stated. This motion to defer actio~ was approved with no more than five dissenting votes. Discussion shifted to composition of the Advisory Committee on Promotions, Salaries, Tenure. This led to a somewhat contentious debate concerning, among othe·r things, the role that college Deans should ha-ve an faculty committees. Professor Frand Murphy noted that there are still no clearly-defined standards by which faculty members are judged. It was decided to postpone any modifications; President Harold C. Martin was aathorized to appoint an Ad Hoc committee which would make recommendations on this issue. Shortly thereafter, the meeting adjourned. Sherman Points To College's Ills by PETER DICKERMAN Marty Sherman, the first announced candidate for the vice presidency of the Student :Senate, has asserted that \Student government should have a very important rol~ to play ..:s campus life becomes more outwardly dire.cted.\ The issue ofcampus community relations was one of many discussed in a recent C onc·ordiensis interview with the candidate. Questioned regarding the potential frustration felt by anyone second in command, Sherman acknowledged that the Senate vice-presid·ency is \primarily a supportive role,\ but remains \very valuable.\ He a<J,ded that \With the proper initiative, it (the role) could be expanded.\ Sherman noted that feelings of frustration can be lessened by a vice-president who is able to communicate well with the Senate president. He further stated that enthusiasm is crucial to one's effectiveness in a governmental position, and claimed that .. Any office is what you make it.\ 1-B .. ~ !

Appendix A of the Report, which states the structure, function, and composition of the varioiis committees. Professor Joseph Finkelstein moved an amendment stating that the ••college Senate may, by majority vote, create, merge, and dissolve standing committees.\ This proposal was passed unanimously. Professor Manfred Jonas, acting on behalf of Division ll, suggested an amendment which would make more ·specific the powers of the Committee on Budget and Priorities. The revision, which was approved by the faculty, asserted that .. The committee shall have access to all non- personal data concerning the financial operations of the college and the prerogative of obtaining specific comPilations of data from appropriate administrative offices.\ McGill Professor to Speak on Corporations Responding to a suggestion that there is presently much student apathy toward governmental structures, Shetman, who serves as freshmen class representative, acknow- ledged that the mechanism of s.tt1dent government - is experiencing a \lull\. However, he stressed that the structures encouraging student participation must be kept alive. Sherman stated that the current apathy, which he described as an outgrowth of the discouraging national political scene, is already decreasing. In support of this argument, he cited the fact that student applications for committee posts have been higher this year than last. Sherman also pointed out that an influx of new faces into government could create a \better atmosphere\ for constructive activism. . Duke EIHngton will also appear in concert on Saturday May 1, for Parents Weekend. Tickets are available in the Student Activities Office for $3. An amendment proposed by Professors W. M. Schwarz, William Bristol, and William Stone, which was designed to clarify the status of the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure, was tabled for rewording. Two items were proposed which would alter the On Monday, 26 April, the International Relations Club will present Professor Stephan H. Hymer, a radical economist and Marxi!;t, who will speak on: \The Multi-National Corporation and the Law of Uneven Development. The talk will be held at 7:30 p.m. in SS 016, and there will be an open reception with refreshments afterwards. Professor Hymer was born in Montreal, earned his B.A. from McGill University in 1955 and was granted his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in 1960. conversation he had with Samuel B. Fortenbaugh, who is Chairma,n of the Board of Trustees. At that time, according to Gati, Fortenbaugh expressed support for the Governance Report, and added that he Would begin communicating with the other Trustees on this matter after the faculty has given its final approval. As -there was no further debate on the issue, a secret ballot of the faculty present ensued. The final vote tally was the following: 61 in favor; 12 opposed. Thus the Governance Report took a major step along the road toward eventual implementation. Exempted from the faculty vote of approval is Section (e) of Proposal #2, which deals with the highly controversial matter of revising the structure of college committees. Tuesday Senate Meeting Is Last With Spencer Attention then turned to Recommendation #2 of the Report, which requests that the faculty to determine its preference for either the existing Division system or for a new byBARBARA McDONALD On Tuesday night the Student Senate met for the last time with. Walter Spencer as Senate President. After the upcoming elections a new president will preside over meetings. In light of this, the Senate listened to Dave ..Bear\ Robbins who presently is the only candidate for president of the senate. His focal point for the president's role centered around the words \active .and reactive\: active in planning Se,cretary Candidate Fazio Urges ~~ctive Involvement Dennis Fazio,_ a Junior, is currently running for the office of the Student Senate. Dennis cite!! his experience with WRUC as technical director and on the student Social Committee as motivating him to consider thls office. Dennis sees a need for more notification of the Senate meetings in order to increase the student attendence, with an emphasis on increasing the efficiency of publicizing the minutes of each meeting so as to increase the awareness ofth~ students. The constitutional duties of the Secretary require only the taking and publicizing of the minutes and to handle c?rrespon~ence. However, Fazio feels the office should become more mvolved m the committee system .of our government. . He attributes the poor response of potential candidates to the tendency of people on our campus to limit themselves to becoming actively involved in only, one organization,. and becomin~ the phantom members of several others. He wants to see people actively involved· in all their organizations, for he feels there is already much continuity among the organizations. w~ich can be har~essed to perform as the base of a well-functwnmg campus community. • student affairs and reactive to the college community (i.e., students, faculty; and staff as well as alumni, and others outside the campus.) Following Robbins' brief talk, Marty Sherman and Dennis Fazio, candidates for vice- president and secretary respectively, gave their talks. There is still time for other interested students to submit petitions having 2QO student sigr.atures. The deadline is April 27th. During this meeting it was announced that there would be a general faculty meeting shortly concerning the governance report. It is believed that they will start implementation procedures at this time. During the next week it is believed that there wiU be a decision on the language requirement, also. Another item on the agenda was the People's Peace Treaty. At the previous meeting the treaty was tabled with the intention being a two week period for consideration. Tuesday night; atnid much debate and dissension,. the treaty was given the senate's support in a vote of 16-8. The treaty was also placed on the ballot of the election as a referendum, to give the student body an opportunity to vote either for or against it. The final a·nnouncement at the meeting was the arrival of another Blood Drive on May 11th and 12th which will be held in the Humanities building. His principal work, \Direct Foreign Investment and The International Operation of National Firms\ is considered the most widely accepted explanation for direct foreign investment. He taught at the University of Ghana as a lecturer from 1960 to 1961, at M.I.T. as an Assistant Professor of Economics from 1961 to 1962, at Yale as a associate Professor from 1962 to 1970, and is presently a Professor of Economics at the New School for Social Research. He has written a number of articles for journals, among them are: \Cocoa and the Gold Coast: A Study in the Relation Between Farmers and Agricultural Exf1erts\ for the Journal of Economic History; and \A Model of the Agrarian Economy Including Non-Agricultural Activities\ and \Efficiency (Contradictions) of Multi- National Corporations\ both for the American Economic Review. Professor Hymer has also co- authored and authored articles for collections: \Multinational Corporations and International Oligopoly: The Non-American Challange.. with Robert Rowthorn in The International Corporation; .. Internationa 1 Trade and Uneven Development\ with Stephen Resnick in Kindleberger Fetschrift and .. L'lmpact des Firmes Internationales\ in La Politique lndustriele de L'Europe lntegree. Sherman stated that as a member of the Committee to Study the Freshmen Year he has concerned himself both with curricular affairs and with student life outside of the classroom. According to Sherman, both of these spheres are under the influence of a general \trend toward more freedom and flexibility.\ In curricular matters, he continued, \People are saying no to stringent structure,\ examples of which are the foreign language requirement and compulsory comprehensive education. Praising administrative innovation, Sherman asserted that \a lot of change has come from the top,\ before students here have found it necessary to protest. Asked about his own view of the apparently uncrowded election field, Sherman answered that his position \feels very comfortable,\ but added that \fm not going to stop U~lking to people.\ In concluding remarks, Sherman stated that his decision to run for office was based on confidence in his ability to do the job wen. Reischauer Will Speak On Asian . Problems Monda!l Professor Edwin 0. Reischauer, former United States Ambassador to Japan and current member of the Harvard East Asian Research Center, will be present on campus this Monday, April26. By his own request, Professor Reischauer will not speak in a large convocation setting. Instead, he will participate in a meeting scheduled to begin at 2:30 .p.m. Monday in SS 016. It is hoped that this type of format will provide opportunities for fruitfl!~ discuss~on of Asian problems, while maintaining :an atmosphere of mformahty. On Monday evening, Professor Reischauer, whose scholarly examinations of Asia have drawn virtually unanimous acclaim, will speak at Linton High School under the sponsorship of the Schenectady Freedom Forum. Those wishing to gain greater knowledge of the complexities of the Orient are urged to attend either or both of these events.

Page 2 CONCORD!ENSTS, APRIL 23. 1971 by RAY KRISE JR. This was supposed to be a review of the Rolling Stones' new album, Bitch, but it hasn't been released yet because the Stones have started their own label, now, and it's being distributed by Atlantic, whose distribution record has been super-loused-up so far this year (e.g., Woodstock II was supposed to appear in January, it came out in March).

Page 4 CONCORDIENS/S, APRIL23, 1971 Sports Stickers lmproue But FDU 'Records Difficult 9-6 Win by BILL HOLLERAN The Garnet lacrosse team ran up against another tough opponent on Wednesday, but the Dutchmen showed signs of vast improvement as Fairleigh Dickinson had to rally from a 5~5 third period deadlock to defeat the Garnet, 9-6, on Daley Field. The Dutchmen were coming off a I 6-3 drubbing at the hands of powerhouse Hobart on Saturday, and were winding up the second leg of a home \triple header\ in which they are forced to face three of the toughest teams on their schedule in only the second week of the season. Union played FDU nearly even-up daring the first period, but the visitors netted two quick scores late in the stanza to take the early lead. After Fairleigh Dickinson ·scored first in the second period, Stan White tallied twice for Union to move the Garnet to within one, 3-2. FDU agaia rallied to lead at the half, 5-2, but the Dutchmen fought back during the third quarter to tie the count at -five all. Senior midfielder Bruce Dugan tallied at 5:02 of the period, assisted by attackman Mike Peng, to deadlock the score before a delighted but chilled long leads Diamondmen In· Shelling. Of Mariners by MARTY BERMAN The Garnet baseball team finally picked up its first win of the young season on Wednesday, and they did it in fine style with a 17-4 embarrassment of Kings Point. The victory on Long Island avenged last year's 2-1 loss at the hands of the Mariners. Dale Long led the 11-hit Dutchmen attack with three safeties, including a prodigious blast into the left-center field bleachers for a two-run homer. Long now has eight hits in 13 trips this season for a rather robust .6r5 average. Catcher Rick Arons also found the left field seats with his own two-run round tripper, as he and AI Westbrook had two hits apiece. Westbrook and Rolf Wandell lashed doubles for the Garnet cause, the second two- - bagger of the season for -each of them. In the RBI column Long led with three, while John Quirk, Westbrook, and Arons drove in two each. Freshman righthander Steve Stockman threw bullets for six innings to get the win. In his initial start, he was reached for one run on six hits. leaving the game in the seventh with a safe 14-1 lead. Larry Berkeley and Kevin Coyne wrapped up. The losing pitcher for the Mariners was their ace hurler, Ronnie Clarke. Clarke had beaten the Dutchmen on a four hitter iast year but it was not to be the same this spring. His merciless coach left him in for five innings, long enough for Dutchmen hitters to clobber him for ten runs (nine of them earned) on seven hits. His successors faced little better, as it was obviously one of those days. Next Tuesday the Garnet entertain Albany State, with the game starting at 3:00 p.m. on Alexander Field as Union seeks to even its record at two wins and two losses. The Great Danes have never beaten the Dutchmen in the five game series dating . back to 1958, including last year's 4-1 Union victory. Netmen Split Two Matches Union's tennis team split twc matches over the past weekenc by identical 7-2 scores, to stretct their early season record to twc wins and a loss. Hobart toppec the netters last Friday afternoon but the Garnet rallied or Saturday at home to win seven o nine matches from Stevens Tech. Brilliant doubles pla~ highlighted the win over Stevens as the Dutchmen scored straigh· set wins in all three matches afteJ struggling to a 3-2 lead througt singies play.

Fairleigh Dickinson bounced back with two more tallies in the third quarter, and FDU's Greg Kirsh scored with three minutes gone in the final period to stake the visitors to an 8-5 bulge. The Garnet however, staged their own late game comeback, as middie Steve Bauer scored at 4:13 ort ·another assist by Peng. FD U iced . the win with a· goal with only 51 seconds remaining. White played another outstanding game on attack for Union as he netted his fourth and fifth tallies of the yo11ng season. Barry Gross also scored. twice, with Dugan and Bauer. adding solo goals. Kirsh artd 'Dennis Dawson led the FDU attack, each collecting three goals and an assist. The Garnet, now 1-2, will wind up the season's most difficult stretch on Saturday, when they host another strong foe in Syracuse. Last spring the Orange topped the Dutchmen by a 10-7 score, in a game played in Syracuse. Game time is 2 p.m. on Daley Field. .. Cindermen Open With Victory · Over· Trinity With Rick lll:siczak turning in four strong performances, the Union track team managed a · narrow 75-69 victory 'over a tough squad from Trinity last Wednesday. Jaszczak ~ Who played an important role with three firsts · and also accounted for a second place finish - seemingly ignored the 25 mile per hour winds that hampered most of the other runners in ,tJ:rt: meet. ln addition to winning the 440 yard dash (in 51.8), and placing a close second to a Trinity speedster in the 220, the muscular junior ran the anchor legs on both victorious relay teams. Juniors St~ve ;Woo(.t Dick Thickens and I~ryant Moeckel, along with soph Tim McCabe,. also recorded stellar performances for the Dutchmen. Wood seemed to be Jaszczak's shadow in the meet, finishing right behind the All-American in the 440 and 220 yard runs. The lanky Ohioan also participated in both of the relay events. Thickens recorded a personal best of 46' 7\ in winning the shot put, while Moeckel and McCabe turned iri e~cellent early-season efforts in their · specialties. Moeckef'easily won the two mile in 10:05 and McCabe breasted the tape in the 880-with a 2:00.2. Bill Clayton, Mike Rich, and freshman Bob Graves also garnered laurels for Union, winning the pole vault, high: jump, and 440 yard Intermediate hurdles, respectively.

Attacks Campaign Rhetoric by PATT)\ SIPE In an interview yesterday, Carol Vaughn, one of the three candidates for President of the student body, outlined the major changes she will try to implement should· she win the election. She attempted to clarify her personal reasons for running and to refute the idea that her candidacy is. a joke. Carol is running for the office because she feels. that she has some constructive ideas and will be able to do an effective job. of carrying them out. She criticized the methpd of campaigning, which she considers to be typical of this type of an election ~ \the ·idea of selling yourself by using a lot . of catcby slogans. afd rhetoric.'' It is the campaign aspect of her candidacy that she takes as a joke; she stressed that she is serious about the office. Jon Pepper, the vice-presidential candidate whom Carol supports refused to be interviewed because of a similar opm1on of the campaign. Miss Vaughn pointed out that this combination of candidates .. represents two minorities, the women and the freaks\ and would provide a change from the government thit Union has had for the past few years. One of the major changes Carol would .like to make is to institute a ''People's Co-op\ on campus. This store would carry many of th~ same commodities as the Bookstore,. but at lower prices. She would lil<e to see a program for Summer Placement, Career Placement, and term-time employment started here. She feels that the present services are not organized as well as they could be, and leave out important types of employment. Specifically, she cited the lack of information concerning summer internships for students. Another service she would like to see introduced is compilation Senate Elections Vote Tomorrow . of information dealing with off- campus housing. This information would consist of lists of people willing to rent apartments, their prices, and names of students who have apartments and are looking for other roommates. She feels that this service would save students a lot of unnecessary work. Carol feels that the school should provide a gynecologist for students, not merely refer the students to private doctors off- campus. She feels that a full-time gynecolo•gist would be unne.cessary, but that a gynecologist should be available - perhaps four days a week - for consultation. examinations, and treatment of venereal disease. She would li.ke to see self- -scheduled exams and midterms at Union, and modification or abolishment of the language requireme~t.

Two men, who between them have totaled 55 years of service to the College, will retire from the faculty this spring. Wilford H. Ketz, long identified with intercollegiate athletics at Union and George H. Reed, professor and former chairman of the chemistry department, will leave the college in June. Ketz, a graduate of the University of Michigan, came to Union in 1931 as track and cross country coach. He remained with the college's sports program until 1969 when he became director ol institutional studies a post he currently holds. He was director of athletics for the college from 1954 until 1969. At various times, he also served as director of admissions, coordinator of student activities ·and veterans counselor. I.<.etz has been active in several regional and national athletic organizations and is currently a vice president-at-large of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). He has also been affiliated with numerous community groups and has serv-ed as president of the Schenectady School Board. Reed joined the Union faculty in 1956 as professor of chemistry and served as chairman of that department from the time of his initial appointment until 1969. Reed has served a number of regional an.d national profe$sional organizations including the National Science Foundation. Seek V.P. by .MIKE HURLEY Jack Overton, a sophomore and a member of Sigma Chi, recently announced his candidacy for vice-president of the Student Senate. When questioned regarding his qualifications for the office, Overton stated that he felt \a long list of past experiences does not mean a person is qualified for holding office.\ He feels that his strong desire to serve, his knowledge of the workings of the Student Senate and the issues with which it is concerned, as well as an implicit faith in his ability are the qualifications he presents. Overton stated that he feels the Senate vice-presid;ency is definately not a supportive role and that the person who holds the office should not feel a sense of frustration because he is second in command. He asserted that \the vice-presidency should play a very definite constructive role in the functioning of the Senate.\ Asked about his views on what he felt to be the pertinent issues on campus, Overton stated that he felt \the establishment of a student voice in the budgetary decisions at Union\ was of prime importance. He further stated that he felt this should be a voting voice and not just merely an. advisory one. Secondly, Overton also replied that he thought the language requirement should be abolished and the Comp. Ed. program revamped. Finally, Jack stated that he would like to see a system of co-operation between the various elements of the college community s.o that \more effective government can be achieved.\ In concluding remarks, Jack stated that he hoped to see a large turnout at _ the elections tomorrow. He feels that a large number of voters would give the newly elected officers \a sense of · support and encouragement\ and would be a large step toward ending student apathy toward campus governance.

(;:•, This Friday night, April 30th; the Union College Co{fee House will present blues singer Bonnie Raitt. Also appearing will be Frank Harding, from SUNY Albany. Bonnie Raitt,. daughter of Broadway star Johri Raitt (the original Billy Bigelow in Carousel' .and the original Curly in Oklahoma) is an accomplished guitarist who has developed her own style of singing blues as well as folk. From the minute Miss Raitt takes the stage the audience is aware of her uniqueness. She has rib-length orange hair and the deepest eyes that you have ever seen. Her voice is crystal clear and when sh~ sings blues you can really believe her. Bonnie is not limited to blues, however. She is just as comfortable singing folk rock or for that matter, whatever she decides to perform. In a review in Billboard magazine was an accurate description of Miss MMMMMMflJIIMMM Thich Nhat Hanh, author of Vietnam: Locust In a Sea of Fire, and official representative of the Unified Bt~ddhist Church of.

The church is located at 347 Loudon Rd., in Latham. * * * * Professor Jonas, Chairman of the History Depai'tment, has asked the Concordy to remind students of the special ~~ opportunit~es of the five-year BA*MA program in American Studies.

I do not have much of a revolutionary consciousness, but I feel that I am beginning to understand the basic differences between liberals and radicals and why · some revolutionaries consider liberals to be as much the enemy as John Mitchell. You see, to say that America is r:acist and imperialistic is not just rhetoric. And most liberals (I can only speak from what I have read and .seen)- are concerned about ending the war because it is a bad war. Some used to support the war but figure that the United States lost so should get out Hair,At Albany,Reviewed by LEAPIN' Hair is Consciousness Ill acted out to the hilt, but for top dollar ($8.50) at Albany's Palace Theater, it was barely worthwhile. A play that turned so many \respectable\ people (3,000?) onto the new \disrespectful\ morality should be above criticism, but 1 will criticize it anyway. My mother told me of the bawdy Broadway· bash she saw, where ear-shattering music and no-holds-barred nudity prevailed. Here, they were the exception. Speaking of the music, comparisons to the original soundtrack alb-um are inevitable; that may be my only basis for calling this particular musical production inferior. However, \Frank Mills\ was given a singularly outstanding rendition by Joyce Macek. I was impressed by the updating of many lines in · the play, so that it was Tricky Dick who took the IR T to see Spiro Agnew on LSD. A couple of picket signs bear rehashing: \Stop Population: Eat a friend?\ and \Nixon is Rosemary's Baby.\ When the Tourist Lady asked the hippies, \Who are your heroes?\ one yelled, \Mayor Corning!\ But the updating was overdone, for Frank Mills now resembles George Harrison, \a former Beatie.\ The best line in Hair came after one guy said, \Wow! You two are beautiful when you make love!\ ~,as he mounted the girl from behind; subsequently, another said, \Wow! You three are beautiful when you make love!'' as he climbed on; and so on: \People get ready 'cuz they's a train a'comin'!\ At times, the Palace lighting was no better than N ott Memorial's, but the hostesses (who double as models) looked great in their Ursula-of- Switzerl;=md hot pants.

Radicals take quite a different view on history and the present purpose of ending the war. Radicals want not only an NLF victory, but liberation wars all over the world in the name of the third world and working class peoples. The Vietnam War was never a mistake; it was part of America's last 75 years of imperialistic history, using foreign peoples (mainly colored peoples) in the interests of its own economic and military domination. Racism - can you imagine a My Lai massacre taking place against a white people? l think even those liberals who finally turned against the war never believed that a colored people could match American military poWer .. ActuaHy, they can't. But they can sup.ercede any determination that America's political, economy and' military structures try to inculcate in the American people. And that's what has done it. There is some kind of revolutionary consciousness which is. international and a genuine threat to capitalism. The white American may never be able to develop the consciousness, but if he wants to be radical - if he wants the NLF to win and capitalism to fall, he can make his own struggle here. I have been trying to avoid the subject of Saturday's D.C. peace rally because it confuses any generalizations I can make. There were about one-half million people there between the Capitol and the Washington Monument. And there was a great deal of positive energy, but much of it sank into the ground beneath the picnikers ori the Capitol lawn. But there was this unity - incredible unity - everybody was against the war. The speakers were different kinds of people. A radical might call them tokens for their p·eoples. But there were socialists, liberals, folksingers, veterans, Chicanos. They all wanted the war to end, and then America could get down to business. Pete Seeger sang along with Barbara Dane and Reverend Kirkpatrick. He spoke, \Eighteen . months ago we were here and sang_ ll. song called 'All We A~:e Saying is Give Peace A Chance.' Well, we're not going to be so polite this time.\ And he sang a song called \Last Train to Nuremburg.\ But what happens dghteen months from now? Does Seeger say the same thing with new songs. Liberals are nice people. They want peace and brotherhood. They may be too nice, because they don't want to even threaten violence. Really, everybody was still pretty polite. Down the street there were some minor confrontations and vocal opposition to the march. It came from two sides- the SDS- Workers Breakaway demonstration outside the unemployment bureau and a handful of rather brave pro~ Nixon students. The SDS demonstration was plagued by a lack of good speakers and a lack of demonstrators. But they made their point about the need for workers and students to work together. The pro:.Nixon students had a good deili of - info'rmation to argue with, but w:heJ1 a group of Veterans . came- around to se.t them straight, they didn't have much to stand on. They believed My Lai was an isolated incident. so one veteran related seeing Vietnamese thrown out ' of helicopters from the air. He tried to continue but was visibly shaken and said \I just can't talk to this kid. He's insane.\ And there were veterans turning in purple hearts and military papers as well as a spontaneous ecological draft- card turn in: \We're sending the draft cards back to the President for him to recycle the paper for useful purposes.\ There were policemen. flashing peace symbols and probably a whole lot more positive energy that I didn't feel because I was somewhere else. But there was some definite good that came out of the rally in the way people related to one another and their unity against the war. There just isn't enough political awareness, I believe. Or if there is, people are not acting on it, because nothing has changed in Vietnam, you know. \What did you expect?\ the question is repeated. t don't know. Next week is May Day. \If the government won't stop the war, then we'll stop the government,\ they are saying. We'll see.

What you should know about diamonds when you know it's for keeps You've dreamed about your diamond engagement ring a thou- sand times. But now that you know it's for keeps, it's time to stC?P dreaming and start learning about diamonds and their value. Because no two diamonds are exactly alike, jewelers have adopted exacting standards to de- termine the relative value of each and every diamond in the world. These standards include a dia- mond's size (carat weight), color, cut and clarity. COLOR: Fine white diamonds are quite rare and valued accordingly. Other shades in relative order of their · worth are: blue, yellow, brown and black. CUT: The cut of a diamond-the facets placed on it by a trained cutter-'brings out the gem's fire and brilliance. Anything less than correct cut reduces beauty, bril- liance and value. CLARITY: Determined by the ab- sence of small impurities. A per- fect diamond has no impurities when examined under ten power magnification by a trained eye. CARAT: A diamond's size is measured in carats. As a diamond increases in size, its price willr. increase even more if the quality remains constant. But larger dia- monds of inferior quality may ac- tually be worth less than sma!ler, perfect diamonds. Although it's important to know the facts about diamonds, you certainly don't bave to be an expert to choose a Keepsake Dia- mond Ring • . . because Keepsake guarantees a diamond of fine white color, correct cut and perfect clar- ity or replacement assured. The fa- mous Keepsake certificate provides permanent registration, trade-in value and protection against loss of diamonds from the setting.

Yet so much of the Arthur Penn's \Little Big film is written, directed~ and Man\ seems to have a double played for laughs that this purpose. First,. it is meant to purported social statement within entertain or amuse the audience the scope of the film does not by means of comic characters, seem to be of any primary' situations, and dialogues, and importance.

Even the slaughter of the Indians, by the white men, although emotionally disturbing, provides surprisingly little enlightenment.

The slaughter sequences ar~ used to shock the audience and they succe~d. but they say nothing show Indian .!Open-mindedness,' Penn uses them for cheap laughs. The comic characterization of General Custer is perhaps the most offensive; it is about as appropriate to portray the murderer of innocent Indians as a clown as it would he to· show the humor behind Hitler's Reich. and homespun knowledge that the Chief is supposed to have. Since aU of the other characters are badly drawn caricatures; it is difficult to assess the quality of the actors' performances. Only WHd Bill Hickock played by Jeff Corey seems noteworthy.

In this sense the film is as simplistic as the old westerns in which \savage\ Indians without any motivation attacked stage~ coaches, cavalry outposts, or wagon trains. Penn has merely reversed the roles. . As for the comedy in the film, it is primarily low~brow, relying heavily upon the abundance of cartoon-like ca ric at ures. Furthermore, most of the caricatures are poorly conceived, too broadly presented, and belabored. Not only do they fail to provide the necessary humor; but again, they undermine the serious intent of the film. Homosexual Indians and contraries did, in fact, exist in Indian Society. Yet, instead of depicting them realistically to After all, one of the basic conepts in tragedy is that the villain should have a stature commensurate with his horrible deeds. Even a depiction of Custer as a stock villain rather than a buffoon would be more consistent with his acticns. It can be argued that such caricMute's are justifiable because Cra·bbe is telling a tale tale, However, if the characters are portrayed in this highly subjective manner, then the events they partake in should be, Thu$, the massacres should not be depicted objectively or realistically. It almost seems that part of the story is being told by Crabbe and part by PenJ?.. Custer's Last- Stand is not seen from any point of view. The camera placement is so random that the audience sees the battle from neither the viewpoint of Crabbe nor Penn. There are actually only two ''characters\ in the film, Jack Crabbe and Chief Lodge Skins. Dustin Hoffman playing Crabbe is amusing in the · comic see .es and convincingly grief-stricken in the tragic ones. Yet as competent as he is, the audience is instinctively drawn to Lodge Skins. As played by Chief Dan George, the Indian Chief has the humanity that all the other supporting characters lack. lQ· his portrayal, George brings out all the warmth, pride, integrity, wit, Calder Willingham, the screenwriter, anc;l Arthur Penn must share the blame for the ill- conceived screenplay and its pre~entation, Most of the better scenes (the Indian attack on the stagecoach and the first two massacres} are more .of a credit to Dede Allen'!! editing than Arthur Penn's direction. In fact. most ·Of the scenes a.re merely staged by Penn (his camera actually moves· in only three or four scenes) and the test of the work is done by Miss Allen's skillful juxtaposition of these staged shots.

The only scenes that Willingham and Penn handle well are Crabbe's meeting with Wild Bill Hickock, the dialogues between <.:rabbe an\1 the Chief, and the conception of the stagecoach attack. This la.st sequence is an excellent parody of a standard scene in .mumerous westerns from \Stagecoach\ on. It also comes closest to achieving the effective mingling of violence and .humor that chat:acterized \Bonnie. and Clyde\. Despite all of thes·e weaknesses, \Little Big Man\ is a film which may well. appeal to . audiences. It tells them what they want to hear, it doesn't make them think, it tries anything for a laugh, and has just the right dose of social comment to make it \relevant.\ .\'if:SS/0: June 7th .Jurw 2Bth July 12th Firw Arts nadi()-TV l)nuna .\atural S('ienC(!

He has hcen an inspiration at middie and has become the team's leading candidate for varsity action next year. Dusty Richards handles the nets for the stickmen and has been turning in stellar performances. He was credited with I 6 saves in the first half alone against Syracuse, keeping Union within striking distance. The score at the end of the half was 2-1 with Union on the short side. but a second half outburst put the game away. Little Dusty has been the main attract ion this ·year. The one-time hockcv netminder has thrilled specta-tors time and again with his scrappiness and hustle. Joining Wolfe at first string midfidd are Denny Walker and Dave Annis. Walker has registNed six goals and three assists so far in the young campaign. Annis scored in the opener against Albany State, but has since been hampered by a knee injury and a slight paunch. The defense is shored up by co- captain Kevin Norris, Marty Smith, and flaming AI Albana (so named for his short-fused temper). Union fashioned its other win against Middiebury, also by an 8- 5 score. The two losses eame against area rivals Siena an,d Albany.

Faculty Council Votes To Defeat Required Language by PETER DICKERMAN - · The Faculty Council, while unable to complete an extremely crowded agenda, . did vote to abolish the College modern language requirement, an act which climaxed the long struggle to eliminate or modify the requirement. However, current seniors were not freed from the language requirement, due to a revision mad~ within the Council. Debate began on a proposal from the Curricular Affairs Committee, which began with the following suggestion: \That the College foreign language requirement be abolished effective with the class of 197 I; and that, effective the fall term Concert. . . The Bradford Junior College and Union Glee Clubs, along with organists Hugh AHen Wilson and Allen Mills, will present a concert in Memorial Chapel on Sunday afternoon, May 2,. at four o'clock. The combined glee clubs will sing Vieme's \Solemn Mass in C- sharp Minor\ and Wilson and Mills will perform works for two organs. The Vierne Mass was composed in 1900, and this concert. will be the fourth performance of the mass in this country. There is no charge for admission. • 1971, a foreign language course at an appropriate Ievei may be taken as a Center 1 option to satisfy one of five upperclass Comprehensive Education course requirements.\ Professor Jan Ludwig immediately moved an amendment to make the abolition effective with the class of 1972, not 1971. In explaining his support for this revisio.ri, Professor Ludwig asserted that some seniors had been advised by members of the administration (.presumably one or· more of the deans) that they could avoid fulfilling the langua.ge requirement, as . abolition was imminent. He charged that such covert activity represented \Coercion\ of the Faculty Council. Dean Martin Lichterman responded that he was \disturbed\ by the proposal to exclude seniors from the abolitionstatute. While claiming that he . did so advise any students, Lichterman added that students should not be penalized for whatever bad counselling they may have received. Registrar Calvin Schmidt interjected that some students had been misled by a Concordiensis article on the original abolition proposal; which Schmidt said incorrectly gave the impression that the language requirement had already been eliminated. Union Coll9t 1877 The ensuing vote on Ludwig's amendment resulted in passage, by a count of 6-2, with four abstentions. Consideration of the newly revised proposal then began, as Professors Carl Niemeyer and Robert Sharlet expressed dissatisfaction with the Curricular Affairs Committee's having resubmitted. \virtually unchanged\ a motion which had previously been defeated in Faculty Council. Professor Niemeyer described this as a reflection of a \cynical\ attitude within the CAC. Dean Lichterman replied that he \resents any faculty member impugning the actions of a faculty committee,\ and further stated that the language proposal was not substantially altered because it was \basically sound. ·• Representatives from each Division reported regarding their respective votes on the language requirement abolition. Division IV had approved the motion, while Divisions I and III had rejected it. Division II. which had voted down the original abolition proposal, did not vote again. Professor Gardner Ketchum proposed to divide \the motion. separating mere abolition from placement within C'omp Ed. However. this motion to divide was rejected.

The Soviets, he explained, have been emphasizing the scientific exploration of the upper ~tmospheric levels of the earth, a program that has dispatched more than '400' craft in orbits . around the earth.

He proudly pointed ol,lt that Russia has 20 cosmonauts working in the Soyuz program. This program's namesake. is the main craft used by the · Soviets for launching flights for futtue space stations. Aza·r~nkov emphasized that the Soviets have set their priorities on extended space flights in order to detertnine the possible effects of prolonged space travel ·on the human body. \It is not time now for heroic flights, but for working flights,\ he asserted, so that within \one or two more Soyuz flights, there might be some sort of terminal space station.\ On the topic of moon exploration, Mr. Azarenkov asserted that both countries use· the same means for unmanned exploration, however, the Soviets Senate There will be a Student Senate, meeting Tuesday night; May 4, at 7:oo·p.m. in Huma,nitillS ll~L Chapel Dedication Of New Building Dr. George W.

In the same election Dennis Fazio, '72, was chosen Senate secretary defeating Jay Dusherer 360-271. A special run-off election Thursday was required to elect Jack Overton, '73 vice-president. On the first evening of balloting write-in votes kept both Overton and his opponent Matrin Shennan from obtaining a majority. The newly elected officers assume their positions with the next senate meeting. In the presidential race Robbins faced opposition from Carol Vaughn and Ed Kanowitz. Miss Vaughn, the first co·ed presidential aspirant in Union history, received 170 votes following her campaign .. Kanowitz tallied 43 in his first bid for 'elective office. Robbins said after the election, \Jt was a good campaign and I look forward to working with -;tudents and other members of the Union community next year. The vice-presidential race was the closest of the election set. In the first evenings voting Overton ran behind Sherman by some 44 votes. In the run-off however, Overton managed to solidify hi~ strong fraternity backing and convert it into a ten vote win. Summing up Walt Spencer expressed the belief that. ..

Page 2 CONCORDIENSIS. APRIL 30. 1971 Love And Violence America Is Wrong by RAY KRISE JR This, it must be admitted, is being written in full knowledge that this is Parents Weekend; there are no bad words in it, other than those relating to violence, perhaps. But there are no words drawn frem the physical act of love. Love and violence have nothing to do with each other. Or at least they should not. There are people going to Washington this weekend, again. Another in a seri~... They are going (as they have gone to Boston, to L.A., to Washington J;lefore, to Chicago) because the United States is the protagonist (antagonist?) in an unjust war - in Southeast Asia, in space, in its own slums, in life... how much like a litany this refrain has become. America is wrong. The politicians are wrong; the politicians are automatically wrong. No one has ever believed a politician, that is standard American folk-'humor: but, in this age of instant death and instant ignobility, politicians no longer bring laughter. They bring cl'ies of outrage. \The time is right for fighting in the streets, boys,\ sing the Rolling Stones on WRPI as I write this. Washington, May l-5. Is that how it will be? Dear God, I hope not. \If the Government won't stop the War, we'll stop the Government,\ is the slogan of this campaign. How does one stop a Government that is based on death (its economy, its laws; its leaders)? With more death? With offering one's corporeal self up for a fighting sacrifice, but a sacrifice nonetheless, and a sacrifice it will bi:!. God, I hope not. They are my brothers and sisters; Parents of Union College. But, more important, they are your children. A child is Life. I want to go down (up?) with them, with the children \flower children\ is redundant. I will if I can, even though some of them are into killing, I fear. I saw an animal try to kill another animal today, I think it was the first time I have ever seen such a thing without a television screen protecting me. A large dog had a small dog by the throat. He was really trying to kill it. The rest of the dogs stood around snarling, taking nips at the smaii furry shap~ struggling in the jaws of the top dog. Men had to kick very hard to tear the dog off. Killing is damnable. My brothers and sisters know this, all of them. You are all my brothers and sisters, even Richard Nixon, but I will not let him be my big brother. I cannot believe there is not one of you who does. not know that killing is damnable. We must have life. That is all that anybody wants - life. Do not forget that life means more than a heart beating. Life is the opportunity to develop oneself fully and happily. and to communicate oneself to one's brothers and sisters, to the family of earth. That is why .people are going to Washington. To give everybody a chance at life. Governments are the greatest oppressors of life known to man. Our Government is in Washington. The walls of buildings have a slow sapping effect on life. But don't tear down the walls. Get the people out of the buldings. Love them, because they are you. We are all each other, people. Abbie Hoffman has said that we live in a violent society, and that any act of violence against a violent society is an act of love. Abbie is my brother, and I love him, as I love you all (yes, even the president). But he is wrong. Love and violence have nothing to do with each other. Or at least they should not. Pray for ' life, people. And remember that Heaven helps those who help themselves. To the Editor: I just wanted to write in and tell you how much l really dig Krise. Like, he really knows where it's at. It's just great having someone nght tnere whenever you need him to tell you what's groovy and what's not. You know, like I can really dig it, outa sight. I was really bumming out. Like I didn't know where to look to find out what was cool and what wasn't, and just when I was about to give up, along comes Krise, and tells me where it's at.

l, Page 4 CONCORDIENSIS, APRIL 30, 1971 .... ' .I Concordy Sport~ Diamondmen Rally In Ninth To. Beat Albany State, 5-4 by MARTY BERMAN The Garnet baseball team rallied for four runs in the ninth inning Tuesday to defeat Albany State, 5-4, on Alexznder Field. The outburst came against star Albany hurler Kevin Quinn, who came into the game sporting a streak of 27 scoreless innings. The victory, Union's second in a row, evened their season record at two wins and two losses. Quinn's skein ballooned to 34 innings before the Dutchmen struck for a solo run in their half of the eighth. Gino - Quirk punched a wrong-field double to left and then scored when his \heads-up\ baserunning caused a throwing error on Dale Long's grounder to short. Union got all their runs in the ninth inning before two men were out. Rolf Wandell and John Quirk started the rally with back- to-hack singles. Winning pitcher Larry Berkeley followed up with a base hit through the box, scoring Wandell and Quirk with Berkeley going all the way to thi-rd when the Great Dane centerfielder let fly with a wild throw to third base. With Berkeley, the tying runner, on third and still no one out, Bobby Bernhardt reached on a fielder's choice and Gino Quirk was walked to load the bases. A wild pitch got the tying run home and after an out and an intentional walk to Long, Al Westbrook lined a pitch to left to end the game. Berkeley had come on in relief of Bucky Rulon .. Miller in the sixth inning. Rulon-Miller had given up only one hit in the first five innings but wildness hurt him, as well a's a few costly errors (one of them his own). Ducky walked four men and hit four others (a Union record): while all the runs charged to him were unearned. Berkeley gave up only two hits and one run over the last four innings, but he also hit a batter - the fifth Great Dane to get it that day. With the win, Berkeley's record squared at 1-1. Quinn wqs excellent for eight Track Roundup Spikers _ Destroy Siena Union's track team feasted on a hapless squad from Siena yesterday, sweeping every single first place enroute to an embarrassing 122-22 win. The victory came on the heels of last week's 75-70 triumph over· Trinity, and upped the spikers' record to 2-0. javelin thrower Jim Backstrom starred in the field events. Hirst won his speciality with a good 22' performance, while Ba«:kstrom scored in his event with a 166'7\ heave. innings, spiqning a three~fut shutout into the eighth and a four-hitter going into the nlnth. He was victimized by errors and wildness in the. final stanza and was visibly tired. Union played Siena today, a a game rescheduled from . Wednesday's rainout. Steve Stockmean had the starting nod, but the frosh righthander might be saved for Saturday's home contest with lNorwich. T Om')rrow's game starts at 2:30 PM on Alexander Field. Netmen Top Indians, 7-2 The Garnet netmen topped Siena 7-2 on Tuesday afternoon to uo their record to 3-2 on the season. The victory followed a disastrous 9-0 loss ·to the University of Vermont last week. A solid team effort provided Union with the win on Tuesday. After Stu Fischler {tropped the number one singles match, Ernie Guillet in straight sets, 6-0 and 6- 0. The Garnet then jumped on the demoralized Indians to sweep the remaining singles matches, with Jim Skiff, Bob Mandry, Rick Judd, and ·Dave Jones all recording victories. Fischler and Guillet ·opened the doubles with a win, and after Skiff and Mike Sachs faltered in the second doubles match, Judd and Mandry came back to record the final Union triumph. Last Friday at the Penn Relays a Garnet mile relay contingent ran a 3.22.5, sixth best. among 22 teams at Union's level but not good enough to qualify for Saturday competition. Rick Jaszczak turned in a 48.7 anchor leg in the mile relay, and another Union competition, highjumper Mike Rich, failed to qualify with a 6-5 leap. Dick Thickens notched a win in the shot put, while Mike Rich triumphed in the high jump, Bill Clayton copped the pole vault, and Dune Hannah won the discuss throw with a 121' effort. Gordie Ellmers recorded the final Union first in his speciality, the triple jump. The undefeated Dutchmen travel to Middlebury, Vermont, tomorrow for a triangular meet against Norwich and the host Panthers. The Dutchmen were scheduled against RPI on Wednesday, but heavy rains forced a postponement. The Garnet made up the contest this afternoon, and will host Middlebury in Parents Weekend action Saturday afternoon. Jaszczak was the stickout performer in yesterday's meet against Siena, winning the 440 and taking part in two other Union triumphs. Jaszczak ran w!th Bruce Mathias, Dave White, and Steve Wood in the \-ictorious 440 relay, and also competed in the Garnet's winning mile relay effort along with AI Prysunka, Wood, and Tim McCabe. McCabe added a win in the mile run in the Union effort. copping the event in 4:39. Other Union victors in . the running events included Ed Wagner in the two mile, Greg Hamlin in the 880, Dave White in the 220, and Mathias in the 100 yard dash.
