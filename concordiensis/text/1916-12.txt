He had a warm and sym- pathetic heart, which was keenly· alive to the wretched condition of the poor, especially in England .. In spite of being a pupil of Gael- win's his actual theories as to the causes and prospects of the Revo-. lution were few. With him Revo- lutionary ideas called forth sym- pathies, not abstractions. Cole-· ridge was almost the antithesis of Southey. His intellectual processes were much more subtle. With him it was not sufficient merely to let the woes of humanity strike a sympathetic chord in his breast. He bent his mind toward finding the exact idea which lay at the root of all the outward manifesta- tions of Revolution. He found that the only true freedom is that \:\'hich obeys the la,w of God. Perfect liberty was to be secured, thought Coleridge, not through the supremacy of the intellect, as Godwin believ-ed, but through God and His Christ. vVordsworth's evenly-balanced temperament was ~low to catch the infection of Revolutionary hopes and ideals. It was a closer view of affairs dur- ing his residence in France which finally roused him to action. As in Southey, the condition of those under the yoke of oppression call.ed forth in him the purest sympathy. But his intellectual nature was also stirred. He, like Coleridge, formed theories, though they were more nearly akin to those of Godwin than those of his friend. They were theories, how- ever, which he was soon forced to forsake. Not long after his return to England he began to see mat- ters in a _new light. The now thoroug-hly aroused lust of the French H.evolutionists for blood seemed to render them, in his esti- mation, less worthy of sympathy. \\'ith his slmvly declining fellow- feeling for the concrete principles of the mm·ement there began to ebb also his sympathy for human- ity in general. Almost on the point o.f moral despair he was gradually restored hy the healing powers of a communion with N a- ture and bv the ministrations of his sister,- Dorothy. He was hrought hack to a harmony with human nature through embracing Coleridge's theory of the divine conduct of affairs. But meantime Coleridge had felt the hopelessness of the !{evolution, which had now demonstrated its inability to ac- complish its a\·owed objects. Southey likewise had succumbed to the .reaction. Time has proved a charitable judge of their appar- ent desertion of the Revolutionary cause. Viewed by a generation unprecljudiced they appear to rise aboye ordinarv Revoli.1ti·onarv trend of thought. They emhrace~l the !\evolutionary propag-an<ia he- cause its fulfillment seemed to them to he a re.alization of their mvn humanitarian ideals.
