Octobe1· settles softly o'er the Jand- A precious thought that blends e'en grief with cheer-. The hills aud woods flushed with its presence stand Though hushed with sorrow for the dying year. In perfect calm the peaceful mornings dawn, That flash not o'er the east light's fiercer rays, Eut ponder deeply o'er the summer gone, And gild the ea!'th with light of other days. Long lingers in the air night's pleasing chill, And lollg the dew upon the fading grass; Nor do oppressive heats their places fill When later hours, advancing, bid them pass; For mid-day suns have lost their brazen .glare, And faint horizons quiver not with heat, But azure hazes dim the l1ill-tops, where Appear so softly earth and sky to meet. A.s if the o'er-ripe fruit of heavenly vines Had lent their blooms to fringe these autumn skies. A.nd touch with perfect ripeness earth that shines Aheady with the hues of paradise. Each wind that starts with Ruddeu, transient blasts Fans to a redder flame the autumn woods, And, in a mood of aimless effort, casts A scarlet shower upon the lazy floods. But naught arises through the livelong day To brea,k the sacred spell October weaves; And when the sun-light steals from ea1·th away Enc.nan tmg moon beams light the withering leaves, Then to the sight th~ glowing colors fail- The anbe1·ed landscape charms with other mien, For, like the lovely face hjd by the veil, It witcltes still e'en though but dimly seen. And every chaNn. that brooding sadness wreathes, Combi11ed. with beauty, rests on field and hill; The shadowed wood a song of sorrow breathes, And \ilver dews th~ir silent tea1·s distil.

' ' Then is wild Nattn€ slowly given up To all the earnest pathos of the ho~r, For even while she lifts the festive cup She hears her requiem sighed from every bower. .And bathes it for a mom:en t in the clear, Unsullied rays the lights of heaven :tling. The time when afte1· unr~:rnitting ca1·e I The leaf that falls b~neath the pure moon's ray, And l'ustles der the path towards its tomb, -Seems whispering to i'tself a plaintive lay And earnest labor in earth~s vineyard wide, The old year comes With gray and st1·eaming hair To bring again the talent muUiplied. ... That mourns its soon-departed summer bloom. -The lonely fruit left -shriveling on the hough, Caressed no more by lea:f or summer's breath, Gives melancholy testimony how The fairest bloo1n may 1neet the chillest ileath. But, 0, the calm that lulls the autumn night ! Despite the shadows coming tempests throw- The wild bird, resting in its southern flight; The air just tempe.red with the breath of snow- Its hou1·s are burdened with t.he deepest. peace; The moonlight, blending with the atmosphe1·e, Transforms it to a gleaming fairy fleece, That decks the lan.d with glory far and near. Let winter bring the weird, inspiring night, With whitened plains, that sparkle to the moon, And winds that from. the north pole take their :fright, And rouse the forest-harps to wildest tune; And spring the night that shields with gentle care Each tender bud that earth begins to show, And summer bring the night that :fills the air With full-leaved n1urmurings when breezes blow. Though ea~h of these is giv'n a pow'r as deep As ever lends a charm to earthly things, They never hold the holy calms that keep The perfect night celestial autumn brings. And 0 ! methinks a higher, nobler life Beats in the pulses of this autumn-time, A sacred pow'r so free :from selfish strife, 'Twas never born within n.n earthly clime. For tho1lgb. its race d1·aws near eternal close, And sterner grows death 's grasp :from day to day, It still, ~uound, the rarest treasure throws, For other lives when it has passed away. 0, God-like in1pulse ! whatsoe'er thou art That makest e'en the dying sweetly smile ! Send fort.h thy presence to each human heart, And all the gathered woes of months beguile ! Within this season gloom should not be found, Each life should seek the purer ligbts that shine, And brit1g against the next year's shadowed round A soul made xadiant by those beams divine. For 'tis the time within the cir~ling year That l:ifts earth's kingdom nearer to its king, And ere departing from its trial here, To wear the crown by faithful toilings won, It bows, a moment, low with :reverent ear, ~ To ca_tch the Master's freely giv'n \Well done.\ / OUR COLLEGE GROUNDS.
