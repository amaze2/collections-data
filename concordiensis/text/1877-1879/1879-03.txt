Deliberation is not, as sometin1es supposed, necessary for the strongest class of choices. The tnost sig- nificant determinations are made instantane- · Jusly, because they are so natural that no -doubt arises. Lady Macbeth's was one of this kind, the legitin1ate result of previous reveries, desires, itnaginations. · When the · unexpected crisis came it found her prepared to take the step with full understanding.

If Macbeth could have scre\ved his courage to the sticking point as she did, they \vould not have failed. The: plot was simple and sure enough.

A LITER.c\RY J\IYSTERY. \Vho \vrote the letters of Junius? \Vho \vas the political censor \Vho, for five years,. kept Britain's potentates crouching beneath the lash of his inv1sible hand? Du1·ing a century the question has been asked and re- peated, but never satistactorily answered .. Such an ans\ver \vould solve one of the n1ost profound histor1cal 111 ysteries \V h ich have ever perplexed the n1inds of tnen. A glance at the history of England during- the period from 1767 to I 7 72 will show the . cr1sis which brought Junius so prominently

Grafton. a ruined and profligate noblernan, controlled the nation's finances. A series of corrupt and ambitious n1inistries, -weak and obsequious parliaments, had 'vell- uigh succeeded in undermining that n1ajestic iabric, the English constitution. Faction and ·discontent 'vere rife throughout the \vhole \vere alike ineffectual to draw him from his concealment. His visor \vas never raised. For five years he continued to maintain his position as state-satirist, and then, meteor- like, vanished as suddenly as he had appear- ed, leaving a glC?ry \Vithout a possessor, a reputation \vithout a name. Of the character of Junius we tnust judge only by his \vorks. l-Ie seems to be actuated only by motives ot integrity and genuine pa- triotisnl. His thetne is throughout the vin- dication of popular liberty. It is true he \vas a severe satirist. Yet he does not seem to be malevolent or ungenerous. Like Juve- nal, his severity is called forth only by the intense abhorrence which he felt for tyranny and corruption in all its forms. He advo- cated the freedom of the pre~s, and upheld the rights of the people. He had a profound conternpt for royalty, and he first demonstrat- ed the fallacy of the maxim that \ the king ,dominion. It 'vas under these circumstances that a ·series of letters appeared in the colu1nns ot the Public Advertiser, the current ne\vspaper of the day. They were addressed to various· public officials and were signed by \] unius.\ Their effect was electrical and instantaneous. Their classic. purity of diction, their perspi- cuity of argument, and their bitterness of satire, rapidly acquired for them a popularity to vvhich no political essays had ever before attained. Enveloped in the cloud of a fi~ti­ tious name, Junius hurled forth his terrible invectives with unsparing 1nalignity. Cabi- net, parliament, even the king hin1self, were openly attacked and held up to universal scorn. I--I is writings always suggested 1nore than they revealed, insinuated more than they charged. In the field of controversy he held undisputed s\vay. T'hose who ventured to enter the lists against hin1 retired discotnfited before the cutting sarcasn1 of the Great Unknown. It is \vonderful how long and how· effect- ively Junius evaded discovery. II osts of enetnies were busy plotting his destructi0n. The emissaries of the king and cabinet sought to take revenge upon their unkno\vn assail- ant. Johnson, Garrick, and the political writers of the day united to crush him, but in vain. Every at tern pt to discover his identity only provoked another scathing phi- lippic, hurling h1s venon1ous shafts with un- diminished energy and uttering defiance to detection. Threats, bribes and insinuations can do no \vrong.\ The authorship of Junius is yet an unsolved enigma. Many have clain1ed, or at least tac- itly admitted the right to that distinction, but no clain1ant has yet succeeded in satisfy- ing the public rnind of his identity. Burke, Chatham, Gibbon, Boyd, and scores of others have, at different times, been a\varded the honor, \vhile a recent author, a graduate of our O\vn college, has published an elaborate argument, in which he has firmly convinced himself, if not his readers, that Junius was no other than the notorious To1n Paine. Of re- cent years Sir Philip Francis has been gener- allv adn1itted to be the author of the letters, ... \upon evidence,\ says Macaulay, ~'strong enough to convict a tnurderer.\ The Fran- ciscan authorship, however, has been greatly disputed. The argtnn·ents offered in his be- half are, indeed, ingenious, the coincidences ren1arkable, but the letters of Junius show a knowledge of la\v and philosophy, a n1aturity of thought and expression, which a tnere youth, as Francis then was, could never

Life is not a line of fancy, Having length and nothing 1nore; 'Tis an angle, wide embracing, Bounded by the \ Golden Shore.\ Life is not a mighty circle, Full of self and self alone; 'Tis a supplement, the rather, Of a grand eternal home. Life is not a plane unb011nded, R. C. Clear rmd smooth, with surface bright; 'Tis a prism full of corners, Sharp and cutting left and right.

For private reasons some of us would have preferred to relinquish our du- ties as editors, but are \\ 7 illing to ren1ain as long as we can perform thern satisfactorily to the College. We thank the classes for their continued confidence. IF THE College Nine are to make their in- tended tour to play the \vestern colleges of this ·State, we advise them to make arrange- ments as early as possible. Already the President and Faculty of Dartmouth have granted. a leave of absence to their Nine of one week. Our Nine should be given at least three or four days, inasmuch as but one trip can be made consistently with the state of our finances, and these colleges rnust be contended with on consecutive daJS. Chal- lenges should be sent and the tin1es of the games appointed early to prevent any ar- rangenl.ents \V hich might conflict. The Nine are doing good \Vork in the \Va y of training. ~ Let action be taken promptly and all pron1- ises 'vell. FROM the fact that the classes have taken no action with reference to electing a new· board of editors at present, we conclude it to be the unanimous opinion that the Senior WE HAVE long \vondered \vhy the intro- duction of our Chapel speakers is not accon1- panied by an announcen1ent of the subjects of their orations.

There is no doubt that a cold, bracing atmosphere is bet- ter for the brain than a l1eated one, but then it is not so easy to n1anage your book \vith mittens on. It is no unusual occurrence for the boys to take turns at shaking dovvn the · stove, during the re~itation, not \Vith the hope of extracting any heat fron1 it, but mere- ly to keep their blood in circulation.

All of the students, with one exception, \Ve believe, have been sick College to furnish just such men as thes~.

It re- mains with us to keep up the reputation for sending fortl1 statesmen \vhich Union has. gained, and to be an honor to our country. A BAD feature of Union College are the small animosities that flourish there. So far as. our obser\1ation extends, \Ve are probably not much ,;vorse in this resrect than other colleges of the sarr1e size, but vve certainly with colds.

()ur college is· cut up into about a dozen distinct cliques,. and the lDen not connected with these from I i natural antagonis1n continue the bad blood. THE REMARK is often 1nade by students throughout the college. Class-spirit is not that they have a great deal to say on the sub- to blatne, as \ve believe there is only a rea- ject under consideration, but cannot express sonable amount present. Neither do socie-· themselves clearly and with force. lt ,vdl ties as societies produce discord.

·THE CONCORDIENSIS. life it is for us to live here four years, sus- pecting and hating even our classn1ates. A man with such a narro\v spirit can never make a wide circle o£ friends, never acquire influence, never have tnuch enjoyment. Every one who perceives his own interest \vill avoid harboring spite and contempt, if for no high- er reason than simply because they are cor- rosive of all that is al·liable _and successful in himself. There are a fe\v men in college -a precious few, bless then1-\vho are uni- versally liked, and these are just the m·en who cherish nn bitterness towards anybody. If we \Vould share their happy fortune, \Ve must be philosophical enough to everlook considerable unpleasantness, and \Ve n1ust not let offence come to anyone by us. But the era of good feUo\-vship vvillnot dawn up- on us \vhile there retnain greedy ambition, envy and treachery. For the sake of every- thing noble and good let us banish this de- testable selfishness, and show that atnong us young n1en the exatnples of generous souls have not lost their sweet influence.
