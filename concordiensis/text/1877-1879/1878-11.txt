['81. The in1portant subject of modernizing the classics in our colleges is receiving \vide- spread discussion at the present tin1e. It is a prevalent opinion of the great educators of the day that the curriculun1 of our higher institutions of lea 1 ning has not been tnodified to suit the detnands of life. One definite systen1 of education has continued \vhile progress has rnarked the course of society and science. There has not been a uniforn1 developn1ent. The qualifications \vhich haye insured prosperity a fe\v decades ago do not prove so efficient to-day. A revolution has taken place in thought, in social relations, in political principles; in fact, in every sphere of action, and that culture must be indicated as superior \V hich best enables the individual to grapple \vith the problen1 of practical suc- cess. Refortn in this direction is therefore necessarY. The belief ol scholars in the J pri.nciples \V hich the old systen1 en1 bodies \vas so firn1 ,and uni \·ersal that it \vas long before n1en rose above this narro\vness and discerned the fundan1ental error \vhich char- ! acterized their convictions.
