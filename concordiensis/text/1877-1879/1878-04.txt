In its greatest productions is there nothing to claim his attention beyond the facts conveyed ? To become an artisan, or a skilful athlete, rules and directions are of incalculable value ' but to acquire true skill \Ve 1nust closely \vatch every motion of an adept. In the in- tellectual world this privilege is denied, great minds work in secret, and their actions can be studied only in their productions; as the nature and attributes of God are displayed in his universe, so are the methods of each writer stamped upon his vvorks. The analy- tical mind of Aristotle, the ardent, active mind of Leibnitz, the strong and compre- hensive mind of Newton, have all in1pressed themselves upon their in1mortal productions, bequeathing to the world not only a vast store of knowledge, but an invaluable expe- rience in their own lives. vVh y then from this vast fountain rna y not the educator dra -vv for the needs of the tyro ?

We hope that before another commencement comes it will be removed and replaced by so1nething more respectable in appearance. No fence at all would be a vast improvement. At a n1eeting of the Adelphic Society, April 13th, the following officers were elected: President a11d Respondent at the coming Anniversary, E. P. White; Vice-President, Fred. VanDusen; Secretary, W. J. Gibson; Treasurer, E. C. Hoyt ; Engrossing Clerk, G. E. JYiarks; Advocate, G .. S. Gregory. In place of Le\vis Cass, resigned, vV. E. Johnson was elected Valedictorian. In the afternoon Dr. Coppee will deliver lec- tures, open to the public, on the Philosophy of History, and before the Senior class on American History. Before the college he \vill lecture on the following among other topics: Health subjectively considered with reference to students ; The Misuse of the En- glish Language ;' On Reading Prose ; On Reading Poetry ; Dramatic Readings. He were highly interested and profited. The Prof. endeavored to overthrow the idea which exists in the minds of some well-mean- ing persons that there is anything in the doc- trine of Evolution that need at all conflict with the belief in a Supre1ne Ruler.
