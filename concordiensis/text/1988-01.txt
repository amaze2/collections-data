The movie centers around her moments, from the quiet moments of nostalgic reflecting to the seething, boiling pain that wracks her sell~respect and person. Kirkland captures Within her performance all aspects of the human tragedy that W1derline her character. At times; she delivers glimpses of the Anna of old, allowing a . spirit of youth and beauty to pervade her appearance. Yet, that peek is usually quickly robbed, with the tired, crying- inside Anna returning. As the audience watches, it senses that something of enormity ·is going to spew forth from Anna, and Kirkland does not disappoint. Anna is a depressing yet thought-provoking film. It's criticism of America is biting as it juxtaposes Anna's shameful Q,isappoint.ments with Krystyna's success. The point that we are a nation under the influence of appearance is further driven home by the young girl's naive letters home_. \ .... teeth are important in America.\ Film Grade ... A KEEP THE CARNEGIE NAME. By JAN GOLDSTEIN Arts Editor \For Keeps\ PG-14 starring. Molly Ringwald and RandellBatinkoff Mohawk Mall Cinema and Crossgates For Keeps attempts to tackle the ordeal of teen pregnancy on screen. The fihn makes light of this all too serious dilemma in order to support the film's · motif: \love is the key.\ The advertisement for the film reads, \It's about sticking around no matter what.'' The advertisement is misleading because this film is really about the familiar scenariQ of the two teenagers who decide they are cap~ble of caring for their unplanned child because they are \so much\ in love. Molly Ringwald plays Darcy and Randall Batinkoff is Stan, her dedicated boyfriend and father of her baby. In the start of the film both actors do a commendable job portraying two love-struck teenagers, though as the filin.continues they are lar less convincing as teen parents. The stereotypical script brings down the acting in the remainder of the movie. A vast majority of the scenes are far from believable and, llence, could not be performed well by anyone. Two scenes in par- ticular deserve mention due to their utter ludicrousness. First, while at the senior prom dan· cing, Darcy ,9 months pregnant, suddenly notices that her water has broken. Not to be outdone is the scene in which 16 year old new. dad, Stan, sits at the kit- chen table, bare chested in jeans, drirddng Old Milwaukee while Ringwald, wearing an apron feeds the baby. Ringwald and Batinkoff cannot be COJ:.Dpletely excused because they did, willfully, accept these roles. The film does address some of the serious problems that ac- company this situation, although it provides a slew .of unrealistic solutions. The couple contend 'Yith the traditional stumbling blocks: parents, high school, money and employment. No obstacle is ~'too big\ for Stan and Darcy due to their undying love. Stan works two jobs, and attends high school, while Darcy goes to night school and works part- time. Where they keep the in- fant is a mystery to the audience. For Keeps shows the power of dedicated love between two sixteen-year-olds while making it appear as though a teen pregnancy is a small in- convenience. If the end of this film were changed, and the couple decided to put the baby up for adoption, then this film would makea superb ABC After School Specia.

CONCORDlENSIS, January 28, 1988 Page 17 - ARTS & FILMS Jim and Buddy at the Movies Film Review: \For Keeps\ By JIM MACLAUGHLIN Arts Editor ANNA Starring Sally Kirkland and Paulina Porizkova Directed by Yurek Boyayavicz Rated R At the Spectrum 4 Cinema, Albany. A week or so ago, in this column, I mentioned this movie in passing because it was not being shewn in the area. I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to take in this particular film, during the holiday break, at the Nickelodean Theatre in Boston. Now, in that Anna has been released in the Albany area, it becomes necessary to devote more than a sentence or two in its praise. Anna is the story of an aging Czechoslovakian film star who, exiled to America, cannot find an acting job that befits her talents. Anna befriends Krystyna, a young, naive girl from the old country who comes to New York to meet her favorite Czech actress. The two women relate well only in that they are an aid to each othet, Krystyna needs guidance in the ways of America, and Anna en~oys being revered as a respectable figure. Yet, as Anna struggles to find an audience in America that will notice her considerable talents. Krystyna is taken in by virtue of her beauty. It is as if to say that America cares not for abilities and experience if it comes in a face that is lined and witheFe<l with age. As th~ movie progresses, S() do the fortunes of Krystyn;J~ much to the stifled jealousy ~f Anna. Anna instead meets witll clegradation as she is forced t() play an understudy in a ridiculous avante-garde New Yorkish play. America, b Krystyna, becomes a land cf gift giving and opportunity, only- because she takes a perfe<:t picture. To AnNa, her exile in the States is torture, a series ()f heartbreaking disappointm- eNts. Arula wears her life ()f stardom, political im- prisonment, and exile on hEl\ face like a Purple Cross, it criEs out to be recognized an(). respected. But instead, her life finds fame in the shapely form of Krystyna, as it is plagiarized.

With the new facilities and first ·year coach · Susan Bas~ett, the womell ·$:wimmers are on record~breaking pace in their best start ever. With their ;recent success the team has 'earned the honor (}f being named this week's \Athletes .of the Week\ Bassett came to Union last - year from. William ·Smith College and her success so far has been overwhelming. Union (4-0) has defeated Vtica (103· 63), St. Rose (156·99)., Hartwick (112·95), and Norwich (111-73). Previous to this year Union had never beaten Utica or Norwich, and they were also unc;lerdogs ' going into the Hartwick 'meet .. The team is made up of seven fr~shmen, nine sophomores, a junior and just three Seniors, a true signal of a bright .future. It is a team that .is considered to be made up of walk\'()ns because of the fact that Bassett has not . been here< long enough · ·to compete with a recrUit. Seniors Elin Doty (Dedham, MA..;Noble} and sophomote Mary K:elly each own two J:ecords. ln the meet against St. · Rose, Ooty broke the lJnion's 100 ami 200 yd. breaststroke mavks, while Kelly bPoke and established one and three meter diving records respectively. · Perhaps the teams most exciting swimnier is sopbomore Kathy Kavaney (Albany, NY- GUilderland). Kathy ·has already set several recordS wnile at Union and is currently chasing more, some even her own. Another sophomore standout is Jaimie Lisher (Woodbridge, CT-Amity). She has set a record in the 500.. freestyle against NorWich. · The Dutch women's 400 free relay and 200 medley relay teams have also set new records. The 400 team is made up of freshman Pam Fielder (Gloversville, NY -Gloversvi- lle), sophomore Lisa Pizzuto (Yonke-rs, NY -Roosevelt) Lipsher and Kavaney. The 200 team: Pizzuto, Doty, Kavaney and Fiedler. Great things should emer;ge this year from the swimming pool of Union College.

By ANDREWMIUER $ports Editor Last week the Major League Baseball Writers Association of Amer.iea announced the results of the balloting in its annual HaD of Fame Selections. The balloting has in recent years · .· come under fire. The writers · asscciation consists of 427 votes representing a Q.ation-wide cro ss.section of baseball journalists. In order for a player to be selected for the HaUof.Farne he must receive 75 pertent of the votes cast. This year's controversy surrounds Congressman Jim Bunning. was elected in his first year of elig'ibility. ) Tllere were nille other votes returned that tainted the professionalism ·of the proceedings, and dampened the significanc:e of Hall-of Fame recognition. The £eff. proclaimed \.Spaceman Bill Lee, a Red Sox pitcher of the mid~70's and unofficial cati· clidate for president, received three votes. Tbe one·tirne switch-hitting Dodger Reggi~ Smith received three, ex-Oriole slugger Lee May (3) and the \Mad Hungarian\ Al Hraoosky (1) rounded o11t the remaining six \notninatio11s.\ y,·rack T ~am Takes Third .in Plattsburgh . Jim Bunning is a Hall of Fame caliber player. Bunning won 224 games and pitched no- hitters in both leagues. His years of service to baseball resulted in bigh rankings in numerous pitching categories. Bunning was a class act, playing the game he loved. This year's Hall of Fame balloting bypassed Bunning. The Congl\essman was four votes shy of the 75 percent plateau. His omission from acceptance to the Hall is questionable, but the voting policy of some of the members of the Baseball Writers · Association is downright degrading. The fact tllat these votes were cast does mt reflect favorably upon the Ba~eball Writers' Association . .But the real impact of these intentionally ''humorous'~ nominatio11s comes back to Jim Bunning. .Bunning was only fow- votes short. The .thought that someone's attempt at humor cost a man wb() dedicated ·his life to the game of baseball the- ultimate recogJJition the game bas to offel\ is <lisheartening. Uist Sat~rday, the Union men~s track team trekked north to C()mpete in the Plattsburgh St~te Cardinal Classic. Although many of the athletes on the team were not competing in their strongest events, Union still finished third out of the 13 teams participating. The University of Vermont won the meet witb 170 pOints followed by St. Lawrence's 142 poirits and Union's 46. • · Although Union had· no in- dividual winners or even second places in the meet~ the Dut• chmen again sho.wed their depth witll several third, foUrth, and fifth places~ Senior . Jim LeBrou led the way for the Dutchmen, taking a strong third in the .1500 meters, finishing in 4:12.4. Freshman Zack Gobel added a third place .in his fir~ 500 met~r dasb of the season, clo.cking 1 :12.0. LeBron and Gobel later came back to carry the 4 x 880 yard relay team to a third place ·finish, as both ran splits in the 2:05-2:06 range. Freshman Will Allen earned a fourth place finish for Union, as his 500 meter dash time was only 1-loth of a second behind Gobel's. other contributors to the Dutchman cause were jumpers -.Chip Silver, who cleared 6 feet in the high jwnp, and freshman Guy ·Burman, who vaulted 11 feet 6 inches in Looking· For Fast Women?

'Freshman Meg (\The Gem\)Parsons sprfuted 'to a th~d in the 400m and a fourth in the 55m dash. Claire ( \Yesss'') GinsbergM Lytle dashed 400m in 66.5 seconds to obtain a second place honor.

Co-Captain Jen (''The Animal\) Lee ferociously clawed her way to a first place finish in the 300m and · 500m runs. Her outstanding per- formance in the 500 matched her record breaking time of 1:22.6. Rounding up the day's events . were two excellent perform~nces by the relay teams. In the mile relay, Anderson, Parsons, Ginsberg- Lytle and Lee outclassed the competition . as they easily earned a first place finish.· Also displaying fine talent, Union's two mile relay team (Cargile, Ni~lsen, Regan and Leonard) gutted their · waY to a solid second place finish. ·Coach Russ (\Pablo\ )Ebbets beamed with pride as he wat~ ched his team's efferts pay off.

Nine voters returned empty slates in this year's balloting. The \no votes\ reflected these writer.s' feelings that no can- didate was worthy of being induct'tld.

After a week of rest and pratice, the Garnet captured their sixth win in their last seven contests by successfully punishing the Golden Griffins of Canisius College 8-4 on Saturday night at the Achilles Arena. The victory boosts Union's ECAC Division Two West record to 5-5, and ties them for sixth place with Canisius. \The week off seemed to take us out of the game atmosphere.\ forward Terry Campbell Judging from the first period it looked as if it would be a long night for the Dutchmen. Although the aggressiveness and hustle were present, the Union breakout and mid-ice play appeared to be extremely sloppy in the early going. Ac- cording to freshman Terry Campen, \the week off seemed to take us out of the game at- mosphere.\ Althouh the Dut- chmen were out shot ten to eight and Canisius carried the play throughout the period, Union did manage to escape the first twenty minutes with a one goal advantage. Scott Manley tallied his fourth goal of the season when his blast from the point shot past Canisuis goaltender Bob Harrington after being deflected off his own defen- seman. The goal came at 16:47 and was assisted by Bill Sedergren. At the opening of the second period Canisius quickly tied the match at one. All time leading Canisius goal scorer Kevin Sykes slipped the puck past Union goaltender Terry RathweU on the powerplay of Bill Sedergren hooking penalty. Shortly afterwardS Skyes scored his second goal of the evening at 5:13. Sykles caught the Dutchmen flat•footed off a face-off in the Union end giving the Golden Griffs a 2-llead. Justice, however, would soon prevail. After the temporary two goal lull the Garnet began to pick up the pace. For the first time of the night, Union's breakout began to flow .and their attacking forecheck badgered the Canisius squad. The Gr'iffs lead would not last for long as freshmen Danny Baldwin tied the game at 18:36 assisted by Nelson Said (10 goals , 5 assists, 15 pts.). Baldwin rushed for the puck from coast to coast displaying his best moves of the season deking a Canisius defensemen and firing a backhand into the top corner. By the conclusion of the second it was obvious the game had begun to shift in Union's favor, out shooting Canisius 14 to 9. The Dutclunen came out tough in the final period and quickly took the lead in the opening twelve seconds on a goal by defenseman Bill Snow. Canisuis goaltender Bob Harrington seemed unaware the period haft commenced and was caught totally off guard on Snow's (2-24) shot. Section I (formerly Section Q) then began to heekle Harrington shattering his confidence. Snow's goal enforced the turning of the tide for the Tbe extra hustle in' both ends of the ice finally paid off with a two goal flurry by :Baldwin and Logan. Dutchmen. The extra hustle .in both ends of the ice finally paid off with a two goal flurry by DennyBalclwinandGuy Logan. Baldwin's (3-0-3) goal came on an incredible tip in from a top-of-the-circle shot by sophomore Dan Gould (0-3:-3), who received a pass from Bill Sedergren. seconds later, Guy Logan ( 10- 2-12) increased the Union lead to 5-2 on a ooomer from the point after catching a pass from Sedergren. Logan has tallied in nine of the last eleven games. The assist on the goal was Sedergren's fourth of the game. canisius failed to throw in the towel however, and narrowed the Union lead to two at 8:26 in the third. Cansisius' Kevin Sykes slid his third goal of the night past Terry Rathwell. The Union scoring force continued to roll however. Bill Sedergren (2•12-14) was not satified. with .four assists and scored Ws first goal of the night on one of the prettiest Dut- chmen goals of the year. Spectacular passing from freshman John Mcintosh (2-3-5) the senior Scott Cyr (8-7-15) faked Harrington out making theSedergren goal look easy. Although Canisius defen- seman Mark Szymusialt narrowed the Union lead to 6-4, the Dutchmen completely sealed the win with goals by Terry Campell and Scott Manley. In a tllree ,on three situation Campen rushed the puck and scored after receiving a pass from Bill Snow (2-3-5). Campen (7-7-14) continues to. impress the Union fans with his speed and aggressiveness. Terry, who has scored in seven consecutive games, increased the Dut- chman'slead to 7-4. · Scott Manley (5-8-13) added his second goal of the night at 16: 42 in the final period, ending the Canisius massacre. Manley strode around stumbling Canisius defenseman Joe Federico and drove the puck past tile weak Canisius goaltender. Receiving · the assist on the goal was goaltender Terry Rathwell for his pass tv Manley. The 8-4 victory, aided by the very respectable goaltending of Rathwell (87% save per- centage) who increases his record to 4-1, moves the Out• chmen to sixth place in ~CAC West. They travel to Massachusetts to take on North Adams this Thursday. · . . . Hoopsters split paiT LeMoyne Crashes Victory Party . ByMARKVANBUREN The Union College men's basketball team split a pair of decisions this _ past week;. beating Binghamton at ho:n;te 77-72 and losing to LeMoyne 88- 63. The Dutclunen entered the Binghamton game desperately in need of a victory, but in the early going it appeared that victory would elude them. Binghamton opened up an early l6a9 lead 4:56 into the game. Two minutes and five seconds later, Bill Peck tied the score at 18 with a 3-point fi~ld goal. F,rom there, the_ Colonials regained the lead 32-27 with 5:22 to play before intermission. Steve Khentigan's 3-point fi~cl goal a minute and a half later knotted the score 34-34. For the remainder fo the first period, Binghamton outscored Union, 14-9, to take a 48-43lead into the locker room at halftime. Union opened the second half with a 6-0 run, to grab a 49-48 lead. With 11:25 to play in the game, Union still held a 52-51 advantage. Baskets by Joe Romer (2), Doug Gregory and a 3~point goal from Mark Trudeau helped the Duthcmen to a 61 ... 53 margin. Binghamton closed its deficit to 65-63 at the 6:14 mark. Due in part to good defense and timely shooting, Union was able to outscore the Colonials 12-9 the rest of the game, snapping a three..game losing streak. Joe Romer led Union with 24 points. Dylan Kelley added HI points and 11 rebounds. The Dutchmen's win streak would be short-lived, however, as they ventured to Syracuse to take on Division II power LeMoyne (13-4).

Page 4 CONCORDIENSIS, January 14, 1988 College Bookstore Copes With Book- Buying Rush New Facilities Compared to those in Nott By DEBRA B. HONIG The campus bookstore ac- commodated the Winter term rush as it usually does, but this time in its new location and under a different schedule of hours, according to Manager Elias S. Majlab>n. The bookstore,. which would usually open on Sunday, the day before classes started, did so this term on the first day of classes, Monday, 'January 4. Mr. Majlaton explained that the store used to operate with a miniihal staff when it opened the day before classes, but with the present two-level store, it would be unreasonable to function with such a small staff. He said, \Based on our ex- perience, we knew that we could open the day class started with extended hours.'' The bookstore had four cash registers operating the first week, as it had when it was located in the Nott Memorial. Security guards also helped to monitor the traffic which backed outthe door during busy hours. The guards have worked at the beginning of previous tenns, but they were more visible now because they \requested customers to leave their book bags outside,\ said Mr. Majlaton. Mr._ Majlaton is pleased with the design of the bookstore, although he did observe that some students had difficulty finding their hooks on the shelves. He commented that by the beginning or end of spring term, his staff will have thoroughly shelved the books and will have posted visible signs. Even though it may be too early to determine the \full impact\ of the relocation to the college center, Mr. Majlaton indicated that more customers hav:e been attracted to the store because of the expanded · general reading department. The Nott contairied only lijOO of these books, due to a lack of space and a management decision. The store presently bas over 7,000 such books. Mr. Majlaton said, \I think it was a desire on the part of the coUege community to have a bookstore that fits the academic en- vironment.'' The mail order catalogue, another branch of the store, was trimmed down from 32 to 8 . pages .. The catalogue still offers . everything from traditional Union College sweatshirts to Union College rocking chairs. Yet, the management had decid~d to reduce the pages in order to limit the selection the best-selling items. · WE ALWAYS NEED LEADERS The Air Force is looking for pilots ... navigators .. . missileers ... engineers .. . managers and ... more.

Birthday Tomorrow: Remembering Dr. Mar1i·n Luther King, Jr. By DAVID BERRY · and OR.AJGSUMMERS Dr. Martilt Luther King Jr. was born 011..January 15, 1929 in Alanta Geo:J:gia. At the -~ge ()£ 15, he e11tered Morehouse College, Atlmnta under a special program f()r\ gifted student.s receiving m B.A. in 1948. Spending tile next three years at Cra:!!:ell Theological Seminary (bachelor of Divinity, 1951), Kin~ became first acquainted with Mahati11a GandFs pliU()sophy ·of n()n· violence as wen as with tile thought !(If contemperary Protestant tlleologains. Fr4'lm Crazer he went to Boston Ki11g met Coretta· Scott. They were married in 1953 and had. fOJJ.r children. Dr. King, more than any other figure, represented tile quintessential civil ri~hts warrior, . llis public life was brief, only U years, from 1956 to 1968, risinl! rapidly from a complete umlmown to a world,of recognition in little more than a year. He was wellprepare!l to accept tbe spotlight and rClde the crest 11E favorable public opinion wllile achieving his goals untilbislJ.lltimely deathat the hands ·!Jf an assasin. N'o other civil rlgbts activist so captured tile llearts of peBple the world over· and aligned them so solidly behind the Black Americans' struggle for equality and freedom. It all began when a tired seamstress, Mrs. Rosa Puks, refused to give· up her ~at on a Mon- togomery, Alabama bus to a White man, as was the law and custom at that time. Tbe arrest of Mrs. Par~ brought into sharp focus the many grievances of Black p·eople in Alabama, and was the catalyst for united acti<>n to effect change. The resultant bus boyeott led by Dr. King catapulted him tCl prominence. The_Montgomery Blacks were victorious · iEl · eliminating segregation oiL city buses and along with a heady success, the seed for greater advancement, the attainment vf total equal rights, was plartted. Throughout the next deca<le, King and his Southern Christian Leadership · Conference marched, sat in, agitated artd preached for civil rights. They suffered threats, beatfrtgs and every other indignity one could imagine as they non-viole~tly pursued their goals. The high point of their\ £trid~ toward freedom, was reached in 1963 with the March on Washington. Dr. King's \I have a Dream\ speech delivered that day will be long remembered as the most eloqaent . expression ever of,Black aspirations.

The counseling center staff is comprised .()£ two Union professors, Professor ~pring and Professor Dowling. Each have a Ph.D. and they both · work in the psychology department. The other staff member, Linda Frye has a masters degree in social work. If a student wishes to talk with one particular counselor, he-she is welcome to make an ap- pointment. Since winter term brings with it cold weather and increasing academic pressure, the counseling center may be a place te visit these next few months. Professor Spring fears that many students believe the myth that only a certain type of person uses the center, and many students may feel em- barrassed or discouraged to take advantage of the coun- seling services. Actually, a wide cross section of students seek coWlseling. Professor Spring sees leaders and non-leaders, students with high averages and students with low averages. However, he has noticed that upperclassmen tend to 11se the counseling services more than freshmen. And, both at Union and nationally, more women seek counseling than men, most likely because women are more prone to talk about their feelings. The students that have used the counseling center talk about a wide range of problems. Some simply want someone to talk to, while others may have more serious problems. But the sessions are private and con- fidential. A student might feel uncomfortable revealing a case of sexual hcrassment, for in- stance, to peers or Union ad- ministration. The counseling center provides an alternative which allows the student to receive help while keeping the incident private. The counseling center is a place to turn to this winter.

INTERNATIONAL FEATURES Myth of the Evil Tarantula By ALBERTO IAIA San 'lito dei Normailni is a sman {()'Wll, 18 kilometers north of Brin•<Wli, Italy, bathed by the waters ofthe Adriatic Sea . .Such a sm.aU town, foWlded. by Slav inv:adel'S during the IX century, has preserved a love of tradition and E<ilkl<ire. Among. the numerous Italy '87 fascinating -events which have taken 11lace in San Vito dlll'ing its lo11g history, one in par- ticular !las puzzled numerous of its inltabitants and an of its visitor:s~ We are referring to the bites of a magic (ol\ perhaps \evil\) tarantula which had unexpLainable effects on those who -wEre bitten. The tarantula in questi<in is described by one of its \ictims as a \large fury spider ()f .a very dark .greenish color.\' As Soon as someone was bitten by the infamous taran- tula, .~veryone in town felt the duty tm visit the victims~ s bouse, bringiJ1g along musical in- struments and cloths of many colors~. The reader will ob- viousl:y find this collective behavLor of the Sanvitesi rather bizarre. However, the patholmgy which followed the tarantula's bite was Itself strangE enough to accollllt for the oollavior above described. Upon being poisoned by the \evilspider the victim would come down with a very high fever,. accompanied by per- spiratLon. By the third or fourth day ~f sickness, the victim would lose touch with reality and tlllls become unconscious. Living in a .foreign country, if only for ten weeks, is an ex• citing and challenging ex- perience. Learning a language, studying art-architecture, and confronting a culture were the tasks faced by the Union students who spent the fall in Italy. The combination of hard work and just the right amount of pleasure made the term a complete success. However, being abroad, surprising problems did arise. Therefore, in order to share their ad- venture with the campus, we asked members of the group what their best as well as their worst memories of Italy 87 were. Best: Enjqying the wonderful food every day. Worst: Gaining fifteen pounds Best: Being in Capri in November, and also talking with Italians we met in Sicily and Florence. Worst: l found myself drop kicked into JFK on December 9. It was then that I knew the trip was all over. -Mary Keniry Best: Teatering atop the Leaning Tower of Pisa with \Gruppo Union\ after a feast of GRADUATE STUDIES IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH Basic Medical Science Department Active Research Programs Seeking Qualified Appl'icants Tuition and Stipend Support Available For Further Information Contact: Graduate Committee Department of ~hysiology Albany Medical Colleg.e Albany, N.Y. 12208 (518-445-5651) salami and cheese~ ])anini and sweet florentine deli~ts. Worst: Dis~lllvering McDonald's plastie al\ches and greasy fries in and~nt Rome. -'Erl()f. McCord Best: There was nllt a best moment, rather t:be vhole tenn was the best ex.pEriertce of my life, seeing the way IJtiJ.er people live and becoming a part of their lives. Worst: The \killel\'\ mosquitos: ate you alive on a !liglltly basis, and the strikes of every public service--trains, bu.ses, mail~ water, etc .•• that sl!JW'ed us down on .a daily basis! Best: In a small homestyle restaurant called rrattoria di Tito in Rome. MJ roommate and I proceeded to eat and drink late into the 11igllt. After polishing off five bottles of Wine, three loaves ,() f bread, gorgonzola, scarn()r'Za, car- paccio ... -- We· - slild a fond· goodbye to Tito, thE CJwner, who. showed the excesses CJf his own eating. Best: Becoming \friends\ with bums who hung ()Ut in the pPst office, in the markets, and on the street corners ill Florence. Best: Going on field trips to see sculptures.-and ar(bitecture in Italy.

This cQmatose stage would be interrupted only upon hearing the captivating tunes plE~yed by the town's. \musicians\ who had, in the meantime, gathered in the victim's house. The .folk music, characteristicfor its fast tempO, awoke the victim from the trancelike stage~ and brougbt him back into the room where the musicians and the local people had displayed nwnerous pieces of colored cloths. In this rQom the un- conscious victim would begin to dance frenetically to that music which eventually became known as \tarantella\ (from the Italian tarantola. Many of the local visitors would ac- company the victim in ms dancing, which lasted for three or four days. During the dance, the victim was not conscious of the events which were taking place, and he was unable to recognize any of his friends who came to visit! The puti>ose of the colored cloths is still a bit obscure, but apparently it is believed that the victim, during the long hours of dancing, would search for a cloth of a particular color which, when found, could calm the magical forces which were within him, and thus end the victim's desire to dance. At that point, the visitors would leave, and the victim would com- mence the less musical portion of his convalescence. As it may be. expected, this odd occurrence was prevalent in the peasant population, since such social class was con- tinuously exposed to the tarantula when working in the fields. Also, both sex:es were equally affected. A cultural notion such as the one just described is likely to sound like a fairy tale, or perhaps a myth. Although the author himself has not been so lucky as to witness the dance of . the tarantella, perfored by a tarantula victim, he has strong evidence which supports the .foregoing presentation as being veracious. In fact, the last documented occurrence of a ''tarantella\ goes back to 1968, and the author has had the opportUnity .of discussing at length that .particular incident with numerous people who witnessed it. However, one factor which renders the WhQld story yet more intriguing . is that, since 1968, no other m- cidents of the tarantula dance have been reported. Some in• vestigators speculate· that the tarantula (of the Lycosa family) might have become extinct; others state that the advent of modern agricUltural technologies has decreased man's manuallaborin the fields to a great extent, thus decreasing the possibility of exposure to the tarantula. The youth of San Vito dei Normanni now smiles with incredulity, when parents and ·grandparents tell them the story about the evU bites of that \feared spider.\ The word storia is Italian for ''story\ and for \history.\ As parents at- tempt to incorporate tbe tarantula \story\ in the \history\ of San Vito, the youth can only accept it as a story. Their children will regard it as a mystical myth. The author would like to express his gratitude to numerous investigator$ who have, through their precious works, contributed to the writing of this article. Among them, a special thanks is owed to Marco Marraffa, whose valuable work in n Ponto reflects his deep love and in- terest for the folklore and traditions which have shaped the history of San Vito dei Normanni.

Apart from being a place to get food and drinks, it is also the ideal spot to socialize. The French. will meet their friends for. 'lunch and discuss, among other subjects, current events. It is therefore. very usual to hear people conunenting on the latest political issues. 'rbe p(Jlitical situation has been such,. for the past two· years, that French people could honestly _ .. not run out of con~ versation! For the. first time since WWH, France is governed bythe leaders. of two antagonist parties: ,Francois Mitterrand a.nd Jacque Chirac. Mitterrand had been the leader ·of the French Socialist party for many years before he was elected president in 1981. In -the spring that followed this historical election (France) bad not had any left wing leaders in power for twenty three years, the Socialist party also won an overwelrning majority in the new Parliment. The country seemed to. be getting itself ready for substantial, but not - drastic changes. A great em- pllasis was put on the economy, as; many big banks were nationalized, and also on educati()n and culture. However, Mitterrand's government failed, where other western governments had, at rE)ducing . the unempl{)yment rate~ In other words, it failed to meet French people's number one concern. Therefore it seemed qUite natural that the Socialist Party lost the majority in the 1986 parli.mentary elections, (. the members are elected for five years). Francois Mitterrand then had to face a new situation: he had been elected for:seven years but was now denied the power to govern with a majority of his own party. However, as dif- ficult as this state of affairs was,. he had made himself very clear during ~ the election campaign.: he would not resign. The constitution states that the president · shall. appoint his Premier Ministre, who shall then form a government. The latter, presents the Parliament with its program and submits itself to the trust vote (\le vote de confiance\) without which it cannot govern. People began to wonder which one of the conservative leaders would be llPPOinted Preni.ier: whether Raymond Barre, the leader of the Union pour la Democratie Francaise, or Jacques Chirac, the leader of the Rassem- 'blement pourla Republique and the powerful tnayor of Paris, would be given the difficult responsiblity of forming a government. Mitterrand thought it was a good idea to give the job to the popular Chirac, bearing inmind that tbe presidential elections were only fQr two years tiine. The president in a .public an- nouncement stated that he would not inteifere With the government policies(\! will let the government govern\) but that he was still the president of aU French people and would act as such as far as foreign policy and defense were concerned. The country got involved as a result of the parlimentary elections in what we refere to as 'la C()habition'. Mitterrand seemed to enjoy his new role, being popular as he ha(l never been before. On the other hand, Chirac, who tried :to impose controversial laws on the country, suffered strong resent and resistance from the students first and then the civil servants. Tonton, Mitterrand~s affectionate nickname, had achieved one of his .goals: Chirac potentially one. olhis.mostserious opponent in next spring presidential elec:;tion, became very un- popular. The elections are indeed to happen soon. The campaign has alread,y started, although some candidates are still officially undeclared: Mitterrand seems to be waiting until the very last minute to unveil his position. -However,. this year's campaign is most unlikely to be of high quality since .peronal attacks against the age of the ·president and seandels involving--both left and right wing leader flourish. There is no way to ,predict who will become the next French president. Mfttetrand seems to be people's 'favori', but there are still four months to. go. Time enough to argue with your friends at the cafe between two sips of \un petit noir\.

It honors his years of personal conunitment to helping foreign . students on campus to become , part of the college conununity -while retaining an identity with their own way of life. One of the ways in which he sought to enhancE international awareness in this region was tilrou:gh his development of the F acuity Foreign Students Fund. The 'Theodore G. Schwarz II Fund for.

A native of Plainfield, New Jersey, Schwarz was a longtime resident of Schenectady. He joined the Union faculty in 1965 and quickly established himself as Union's unofficial diplomat both on and·olf campus. Besides his . interest in broadening the cultural diversity and un- derstanding of the region, Schwarz donated much of his time to several Schenectady· based social sevice agencies, including the Schenectady Inner City Ministry.

Page 10 CONCORDIENSIS, January 14, .1988 Quality, Not Quantity The flood of mail into Admissions will be at its peak soon, as the February application deadline looms ahead. The staff will be selecting the class of '92, and this time it has to be smaller than the last. The past two classes have streched the college facilities to the breaking point. Dean Wood had admitted that three-man doubles and five-man suites have become a norm. Correspondingly, introductory classes have swelled to 45 people or even more. Registrar Dean W. olf said that the college's facilities were \nearly stretched to the limit.\ Students come to Union for its reputation. as a small college with small class sizes -- and ironically they have foun~ themselves crowded in the dorms and in the classrooms. The reasons for overcrowding are complicated. In part, a less than appealing construction site of a campus caused Union to accept niany more students in hopes of getting the usual number of freshman. This guesswork brought over 50 extra freshman to Union in the past two years. But now the construction is finished, and the new facilities have been completed. This has boosted the enthusiasm of visiting students, and the much-publicized dropping of the SAT's has increased the number of applications immensely. Now we can be more particular in our selection. Union doesn't have to accept nearly 50% of its applicants to get its freshman class. The admissions office should cut way back on its acceptances, to compensate for overcrowding and to tetum Union to its \highly competitive\ ranking, accepting around 35o/o of its applicants while maintaining quality. Lists may be misleading, but as we've said before, they are a highly visible standard for prospective students all over the country. Reducing size is only one objective for the year. Dropping the SAT's has presumably encouraged hundreds of unusual, diverse students to apply to Union. _We simply can't miss the opportunity in enrich the student body with student interested in more than jobs and GPA's. Unless we actually act on the opportunity, the decision to drop the SAT's becomes only a hypocritical publicity gimmick. And unless we reduce the overloaded student population with a normal-sized freshman class, all our claims of being a small college, devoted to the students a.n.d to learning, are hypocritical as well. LETTERS Residence Life Responds to Previous Letter . . ., To the Editor: 'l'his is my first \Letter to the Editor\ during my tenure at Union, and is written to serve as a cl.,ification to the inaccurate assertions made by Rick R,oberts in his letter in the Nov. 12 Concordy. 1.

Maids and Building :Main .. tainers; Buildings and Grounds ~ moving furnitw-e; Trades - plumbers, electricians, car- penters,· painters, etc. Main- tenance does not .report to the Office of ~sidence Life, nor are they under my direction or supervision. Students are asked to report m~tenance concerns on the \Maintenance Requests\ sheets taped to the R.A.'s door. R.A.

'Ibis brief · explanation is not meant to imply the system works perfectly. Few know better than I the attendant problems. When the effort to fix it .falls Short, it is my qffice's responsibility to continue with detailed communication with Physical Plant per.-sonnel until the repair is complete. Sometimes it takes more than one effort to correct a problem. 2. The resolutions passed by the Student Forum and the St11dent Affairs Colineil which changed the priority by which st11dents choose .rooms clearly stated the change woQld occur for the lottery hel<l in Spring 19118. Copies of the document are available from the Student Forum, Student Affairs Council, Dean of Students Office, or my office. The rules which will govern the \Spring 1988 Lot· · tery\ are: Singles priority to seniors, juniors, S()phomores Co·ops priority to seniors, juniors, sophomores Suites, Triples, Doubles .priority to sophomores, juniors, seniors. 3. 'lbe policy to appeal an assessment for room damages at the end of the academic year is clearly detailed in the letter accompanying the assessment. Basically, to appeal one must write a letter and make an appointment with the· respec- tive Area Coordinator during fall term. To remind studellts~ signs are posted pro.mnently in' an the residence halls, librai'y,. and dining halls, during the Znd and 3rd weeks of the term. 4. Lastly, it is my observation that the integritY of a val11ed employee. of the College was publicly and wrongfillly tar· nished. Mr. Fred Peets~ who ba~ served ihe College for many year, has oonsistenly displayed , an extremely positive attit11de towards students, and bas always bent over backwards to · make ~tudents more t!om- fortable:. His ,attitude; work ethic, artd belpfullless are trUly impressive and greatly ap- preciated. The..p1,1blic and \dead wrong\ account of how Mr. Peets failed to carry C>Ut his responsibility cannot be allowed to ling err It is ]ust notrightto let the community be left with the notion Mr. Peets is anything but a dedieated and faithful em- ployee CJf the College. · Agam, the intent of thi$letter is to darify the inaccurate statements made in Mr. Roberts' Letter to the Editor. Thank you, DaVid L. Wood . Associate Dean for Residence Life . But Has Criticism Only Just Begun'? To the Editor: I read \A different view of Dean Wood,\ (Nov. 19) by Charlie Campanione, over two hours ago and my stomach still hurts. While I do not take pleasure in insulting a classmate, I was quite appalled by the lack of reasoning in the letter. (Reason is what · separates man from the other animals, is it not?) Apparently, some of us have some evolving to do. Mr. campanione asserted, that Dean Wood was doing an admirable job as Dean of Residence ~e, Yet his own evidence contradicted his assertion. :Mr. Campanione stated that be \had many complaints\ and that he bad to wait two hours in Dean Wood's office before he would even be heard. If this is supposed to supposed to support Dean Wood's efforts .•. I spoke with Rick Roberts, the author of \Ode to Dean Wood\ (Nov. 12), the article to which Mr. Campanione thought he was writing against. (Is thought, too strong a wcrd here?) Mr. Roberts told me that after his article was printed, he received praise from everyone who read the article who knew him. Furthermore, dozens of students told him of their own problems that were inadequately handled by ad- ministration. As Mr. Cam- panione -states, a day in Dean Wood's shoes is a day where you \wake up in the morning and listen to the complaints of two thousand students.\ Of course, whose fault is that? Certainly, Dean Wood. is becoming somewhat of a scapegoat, but it would have been nice if he had responded to Mr. Ro.berts letter personally, instead of doing what he seemingly does best .... ignoring problems as they arise. To his credit, Mr. Cam- panione did advocate con- structive criticism of Union and that has resulted in the ' ,following list of grievances. The longer I worked on compiling it, the more angry and fruStrated I became - qry because ·the situation has perSisted for so long and frustrated because I know nothing will change. So why the list? Hopefully, a subStantial number of students who share my views will join m~ in petitioning the ad- ministration and the ad- ministration's hypocrisy will 011ce again be exposed •. If the administration ever complains of vandalism, student apathy, or lack of funds from alumni ten years down the road, they will know they have only themselves to blame. A healthy educational environment reQuires that rUles be agreed upon, not mandated. When tnis article is ultimately ignored by the administration, or filed under \G\ for Garbage, the succeeding classes Will have no reason to believe the ad- ministration truly cares about students' opinions. It is this frllstra:tion ..,. the inability t9 affect policies that directly concern us- that bas resulted in a stifling of intellectual curiosity, apathy and evert vandatism.

Caplan, in ller book The Myth of Women's Ma841chism (New A.merican library, 1987, p. 1-4&) states,· ''Pornography teacJies men that they have, and d.~erve t() have, sexual power~o.-ver women and that it is mas.cl:lline and glamorous to ex::e·r.eise and abuse that power.\ 'JJds further reinforces the bel]ef that women do not really know what they want, and that men should not take \no\ for aJJ answer. This message is not only ·of- fensive, but .in this age when date Md acquaintance rape are such prevalent issues, it is dangerous as well Many stu~es, such as the one conducted by the· Attorney General's Commission on Pornogrilphy (l986), have shown cl.ii\ect correlation bet- ween pornqgrapby and acts of violence against women. Some people may ar,gue that this point is remote from ,the Union College campU$; however, that is not so. There have been several inCidents of sexual .assault involving students on tbis campus. While we do not mean to a~ciat.e pornography withtbosespecific incidents, we are pointing out that such things have and do occur at Union College. Thus the possibility does exist that the showing of a pornographic fUm could provo)ie aC~;s of violence against women. T,he often re~ated suggestion, \If you don t like the movie, don't go to see it,\ is a moot point in, light of the possible effect of this movie on :our lives~ The purpose of the Film Committee is _to provide en- tertainment _for the Union College campus.

For one thing~ calling it a bo~l!t store is a misnomer; rather it .should be known . as the \Uni<Jn College · Gift Shop featu:rtng Course Books.\ The fact th.at when the \Book Store\ w~ moved the . ' sweaters and mugs were on disptayand~or sale 1Jiree weeks before any books were offered for sale certainly r-.eweals their priorities. Since orte oonnot find a real book store in all of Scnenectady, (I h.ad to drive to Albany to get a eopy of The Odyssey) it is. somewhat distressing that a «:<»llege with Union's reputaticmt does not offer a decent selection of books .outside of course boeilcs, with the possible exception . of books written by faclllty and the School is Hell books. Many schools . have nom-profit book stores that are stlideot rWI. Others have two ~r more book stores. These sch()IJ!s also have an eerie absence of signs ,posted around campus br students selling their bo()kS to .. other students. Weird, hwh? Maybe Adam Smith was right about comPetition after all. I think $51.00 for a hooded sweatshirt is a bit extreme. · Il) There are CErtain basic rights and privileges that every student Who pays $1~.000 shOuld •~>(! able to enjoy. I d10 not think . that is is unreasOIJable to ask for real shower~~ Firalyr. there is ~ problem with plwobing. Mr. Roberts went into ~me detail about this and thoe terrible. fear that. someone might 1\ave to .use the toilet (God forbid!) while you are in the sh10wer. so I -will simply state that sertous work is urgently need«l to prevent students from llelng scalded and to· assur& tliat other showers even hav;e hot water. This does not seem to be an unreasonable request. There is more,- thQugh. The showers in some dotm.S are <:oiilmunal (e.g. West), share one drain, and probably violate some .of NewYork State's Healtli Codes. Instead of looking forward. to a hot shower on a cold winter morning, the·general reaction is sometbing akin to the anxiety of playing Russian Roulette - ~xcept with six bullets .. lll) Union, as far as I know, is the only college in the United States with on campus housing that does not ha.ve a recreation ~oom. While this might seem somewhat trivial, ignoring the magnitude, many students had eagerly anticipated one and expected it was to be included in the College Center - Student Center -Carnegie ( ! ) . Certainly, a recreation room has many · benefits such as being a place to socialize, alleviate aca~emic stress and the facilitation of more student jobs in main- taining the room. : IV) Probably the most ap- palling violation of students' constitutional rights is s~urity and Safety's threat of floor fines for vandalism and false fire alarms. As far as I know, preSUIIlPtion of guilt iS not of the basic tents upon which this country was founded. If any student has ever been fined due to an act. committed on their floor that they were not per· sonally re$ponsible for, nor were they questioned about, please consult me at once !illld I will see about getting you a lawyer. I think Cliff W()ctd, the Dean of Security and Safety, should make a public apology to the students of Union College for allowing such threats to persist. Under no cir· cUinstances can the guiltless be fined, especially witlwut a hearing. V) Room Inspections: While securl,t.y does have the right to inspeCt rooms for safety reasons, (this is stated m the Residence Hall Contract that all students livtng on campus slped) they can only inspect rooms at students' leisuref not money making organization. And yet people often attempt to justify the showing of this film by .stating that it always makes a lot of money. We. feel that there is no possible justification for the showing of this fihn. Pornography is extremely offensive and potentially dangerous. Part of the responsibility of the college and its organizations is the safety of the st11dent body. We find it appalling that Union College A' ,has faUed to respond to such . arguments as those stated above, which have been made in the past not only- .by students, but by various established groups on campus such as religious organizations,. the Women's Network, and organizations formed specifically against por- nography. We ask that the Film Committee reconsider the showing of a pornographic film in light of the arguments presented in this letter. We look forward to their response; Ref!pectfully' Denise Feinsod '89 Stephanie Hirnak '88 at their own as they would want us to believe. In aU fairness, room search dates and times are posted far enough in ad- vance that there is plenty of time to call them and make an appoi,ntment that is mutually convenient. If Security refuses, contact the A.C.L.U. who are particolarly fond of preventing illegal searches when there is no probably cause or warrant, which, I believe, is a felonious offense. VI) I am not sure if the meal plan falls under Title 18; Section 1302 & 1341 which states that \a product of service must be exchanged for the money received.\ However, even if it does not, there is no reason why students should have to pay for mealsthey do not eat. Granted, the school would lose thousands of dollars. But considering that the quality of the food is below par, there is no reason the College should get money for nothing. Many other schools use meal cards with magnetic strips to charge students only for the meals they eat, Cer~ tainly Union could consider this course of action. \ VII) Another example of the College receiving funds without providing a service is class withdrawals. When a student withdraws from a class the school does not refWld any money, even on a pro-rated basis. In effect, the student is paying full tuition costs to have a \W\ placed on his report card. Furthermore, while in theory, the sixth week seems to be a fair time to be allowed to withdraw, students usually do To the Editors: I was pleased to .see Carl Friedrich's article (Nov. 12) on. the need for an honor code at Union. It would be a very major step to adopt such a systeJJJ., and we should not do so unless there is a substantial consensus among studentsand.faeulty that we em make it. work. 'Po achieve such a consensus will require serious discussion over a protracted' period .of titne. I would suggest thatthe AAC and SAC should move together to appoint a task force to study and report on the matter before the end of spring tenn. Although I SYJllpatbize with Friedrich's concern about :~uch problems as theft and van- dalism, I suspect that these are matters more appropriately dealt with my means of established internal and. ex- ternal disciplinary and legal mechanisms. Assault, rape, theft, and destruction of property are., after all, primarily criminal activities. The College can and should mete out its own punishments for such actions, but not in place of judicial dispositions. About the academic honor code jt should be .. said that a great deal of responsibility for enforcement must rest 'With students. If the notion is that students \blow the whistle\ on their peers and then wait for deans, and faculty members to sit in judgment, the system will lack a full measure of moral force. l believe that some honor systems ate divided into two parts, one of which deals with examination~, the other of which pertains to papers, essays, and lab reports. Student honor committees should be capable . o.f conducting in- vestigations and rendering judgments in cases of alleged dishonesty in examinations. However, a student-faculty connnittee may be essential in evaluating the potentially more complex issue of plagiarism in papers. Service on such com- Inittees can be time-consllllling and thankless, but no one should doubt its importance. For now, let us simply resolve to begin a discussion of the possibility of implementing an honor system. No amount of salesmanship or manipulation can lead us to take such a step if it does not ''feel right\ to .preponderant majorities of students and faculty. Charles M. Tidmarch Professor and Cahir Department of Political Science Have An Opinion? Write Concordiensis not know .how they are faring in a class until the seventh week when midterms are often returned. VIII) Students should be given a larger role in campus policies. A perfect elWllple of this was Union's decisi()n to drop the SATs (GelaTime is too perfect an example. As far as I know, the decision was made independent of students' opinions. While it is quite possible that the majority of students would have approved this course of action, I d() not know, but it is irrelevant. The fact that the student body was not consulted once again reveals administration's disregard for students' ideas. IX) Maintenance: I refer once again to Mr. ROberts who exposed many ()f the flaws in the present system (and to Mr. Campanione who did so inad- vertently). There is no reason why a person should have to wait several months to have their window replaced, or lock fixed, etc. Students should call maintenance directly and get a specific appointment time. Obviously, emergency situations should have priority. This seems like a fairly siJnple, yet effective solution. Obviously, details have to be worked out. X) Course Requirements: I reali2e there is much debate CDC NEWS g()ing on right now, but I would iike to suggest that elective requirements be minimized or eliminated. The students that are admitted to Union should be responsible and curious enough to give themselves a diverse academic schedule. When a student is given a strict requirement, a rather easy class is often sought that meets that requirement which the student, does not care a~ut. This only serves to waste the time and money of the student since it is very very rare that he-she will get anything out of a course that he-she is Jorced to take. Requirements (outside of the major) are a slap in the face. In effect, it is the ad- ministration's way of saying that they do not have enough faith in the students they accept to expand themselves by taking a variety of classes. To say this is a complete list would be inaccurate. I do urge all students who agree with most .or all of my complaints to leave a short or long note in Box No. 1737 (even your signature under the words \I agree\ will do). If there is a substantial number of responses I will take them to the administration where they may be officially ignored. Sincerely, CevinSoling '88 What's Happening on Wall Street?

CONCORDIENSIS, January 14, 198/J Page 11 LETTERS Pornographic Filn1 Protested Try Together For Honor Code To the Editor: We would like to re-address the i£sue of the annual pJJesentation of a pornographic film lly the Union College Film Committee. Previous attempts to ca11cel this fUm have always failed,. and last year the issue was never even raised, perhaps because of a sense of poill• tlessness. However, we feel the sllowillg of this film is so .()f- fensive as to warrant .further attempts to prevent it. Women in pornography ar,e shown as sexual objects, often taking pleasure in being raped or otherwise degraded. Many pornographic movies propagate the message that women nevel\ really mean \no.\ Women are depicted as resisting and then giving in, and loving it. Dr. Paula J. Caplan, in her book Tb.e Myth of WomeR's Masochism (New American Libraiy-, 1987, p. 146) states~ \Pornography teaches men tl!at they have, and deserve to have, sexual power over women and that it is masculine and glarnllrous to exercise and abuse that power.\ This further reinf~rces the belief that womeD do not really know wllat they want, and that men shollld not take \no\ for an answer. This message is not only of- fensive, !:Jut in this age when date and acquaintance rape are such prevalent issues, it is dangeroiiS as well. Many studies, such as the one conducted by the Attorney Genera:l's Commission on Pornography (1986), have shown direct correlation bet- ween pornography and acts of violence against women. Some people may argue that this point is renl()te from the Union College campus; however, that is not so. There have been several incidents ef sexual assault inv()lving students on this campus. While we do not mean to associate pornography with those specific incidents, we are pointing out that such things have and do occur at Union College. Thus the possibility does exist that the showing of a pornographic film could provoke acts of violence against women. The often repeated suggestion, \If you don't like the movie, don't go to see it,'' is a moot point in light of the possible effect of this movie on our lives. The purpose of the Film Committee is to provide en- tertainment for the Union College campus. The Film Committee is not meant to be a .... Continuing Criticism Co11tinued from page 10 tb.at reveal the administratio11' s blatant disrespect for students' rights as citizens as guaranteed by the Constitution. Points VI- X basit:ally show the ad· ministration's disrespect for stude11ts in general. 1) the Book Store: This bas always been a little joke arolllld Unio11 that never seems to l>e very funny when it comes time to sell back books. For one thing, calling it a book store i.B a mismmer; rather it should he knovm as the \Union College Gift Shop featuring Course Boolts.\ The fact that when the \Book Store\ was moved, tlte sweaters and mugs were on display and for sale three weeks befori! any books were offered for sale certainly reveals tbeir priorities. Since one cannot find a r-eal book store in all of Schenectady, (I had to drive to Albany to get a copy of Tile Odyruey) it is somewilat distressing that a conege with Unic11's reputation does not offer a decent selection of boCJks outside of course books, with the possible exception of bo()ks written by faculty and the Sch4l01 is Hell books. Many schools have non-profit bCJok stores that are student run. Others have two or more bCJok stores. These schools also have an eerie absence of signs posted aro1111d campus by students selling their books to other students. Weird, huh1 Ma:ybe Adam Smith was right about competition after all. I tllink $51.00 for a hooded sweatshirt is a bit extreme. II) There are certain basic rights and privileges that eve('f stuc:lent who pays $16,000 should be able to enjoy. I do not think that is is unreasonable to ask. fox- real~howers. Firstly, there is a prolilem with plumbing. Mr. RoiJerts went into some detail abo11t this and the terrible fear that someone might have to use the t()ilet (God forbid!) while you are in the shower. so I will simply state that serious work:: is tll'gently needed to preve11t st11dents from being scalde(! anc:l to assure that otb.er showers even have hot water. This does not seem to be an unreasonable request. There is more,· tbough. The showers in some dorms are communal (e.g. 'West), share one drain, and pmbably violate some of New York State's Health Codes. Instead of looking forward to a hot shower on a cold winter morning, the general reaction is sometlling akin to the anxiety of playing Russian Roulette - except with six bullets. · III) Union, as far as I know, is the only college in the United States with on campus housing that does not have a recreation room.

If any student has ever been fined due to an act committed on their floor that they were not per- sonally responsible for, nor were they questioned about, please consult me at once and I will see about getting you a lawyer. I think Cliff Wood, the Dean of Security and Safety, should make a public apology to the students of Union College for all()wing such threats to persist. Under no cir- cumstances can the guiltless be fined, especially without a hearing.

This series combines both aspects of education and en- tertainment as it examines the music of vari()US cultures, in- cluding our ow:n, which employs improvisati()n as tradition. The 1983 series premieres on Friday, January 15th with a display of Karnatic music from South India. The trio is led by flutist Tanjore Viswanathan, who tours as a solo performer and accompanist to his sister, the renowned classical dancer Balasaraswati. It also includes Trichy Sankaran, a teacher at York University who plays the mrdangam, a traditional drum played on its side, and Ra.rnnad Raghavan on another South India instrument called the kanjira. The series continues on alternating Fridays tluough Febuary 26th. The second program is entitled ''Music and Dance of the British Isles.\ Featuring Irish stepdance and Morris dance, and possibly including the story-telling talent of Jim and Lauren Cowdery. Jim Cowdery learned his style from one ef the masters, Joe Heaney of County Galway, and was a foilllding member of one of America's first group featuring Irish and Scotish traditional music. He earned his Ph.D. in Enthnomusicalogy from Wesleyan University in 1985. Lauren Cowdery has studied various forms of traditional dance and most recent, has been performing traditonal Irish stepdancing. Their per- formance takes place on January 29th. The third concert examines the roots of American Jazz. Torn Ross, an associate professor of music hEJre at Union, will be performing on the guitar and mbira ( thumb piano). This performance exemplifies a blend of rhythm and sounds from India and Africa, enhanced hy his Western music training. He wiU be joined by Jane Ira Bloom on the saxaphone and bassist Jeff Fuller.

Anthrax have always been on metal's cutting edge, and this is proof once again that they're a band not afraid to take t::hances. \I'm The Man\ is a hilarious review of how the members of Anthrax FROM facial expressions and en· thusiastic attitude contributed to his. outstanding performance. Four more short scenes cancluded the play. Will Persol played the punk Delinquent .. Triballous. His acting was impressive. Joe Murphy played the informer. Then Matteo Coveri·Abbondio, who plays Prometheus, humored us under a blanket as he converses with the citizen. Finally, Ed Rosenfield, who plays Poseidon, made an eloquent speech. The story in the sky ends with the marriage of one of the citizens and Zeus' daughter, an in inflated doll. They drive away on a fantastic motorcycle to celebrate. Zeus shows his appreciation for the Birds new freedom by allowing his daughter to marry thecitizen. -· President Morris and others from the audience joined the cast on the stage as they danced and sang to celebrate. Also, the outstanding Bird performances by Kristen Allison, Andrea Foege, Jillian Shanebrook, Kim Stauchon, Nadia Duvilaire, Jennifer Torrant, Jennifer England, Johanna Campbell, Jean Beaty, Andrea Mobilio, Raachel Elfenbein, Eillen Scutt, and Annette Fraser add en- thusiasm, sound effect, and visual impact for the audience. Anthrax I'M the Man Island Records see themselves and their music. there are three versions of the song on the EP; censored, uncensored, and extremely def- ill uncensored, which is recorded live and really cap- tures the song and the band at their best. Also, if your a fan of Anthrax' brand of thrash metal, fear not, for there are live versions of \Caught in a Mosh\ and \I Am the Law\ recorded from the band's \Among the Living\ world tour. Also, there is an incredible cover version of Black Sabbath's \Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\ that blows the original version away and is i11 my opinion the highlight of the album. Overall, this album will please both metal and rap fans. HELL SUNDAY NIGHTS 1 O:OOPM - 2:00AM ON W.R.U,C. SCHENECTADY 89.7FM

CONCORDIENSIS, January 14, 1988 ARTS & FILMS J.im and Buddy at the Movies By JIM MAC LAUGHLIN Arts Editor · 'Not that in ten years from fi()W anyone will care, but, for want of a better idea, it was generally agreed that the first :clwnn of the new year should tr!. some way eneapsulate a few of the more memorable films viewed over the recent v-acation. In general, the 1-rolidays were loaded with a ~lethora of movie releases. Some fihns were the average, Mill-of-the-mill, boliday movies tilat invariably dot the cinematic landscape, but for the most part, the trip to the tlleatre did not disappoint. Steven Spielberg's Empire of tbe Sun was far and away the m<lst affecting film this r~viewer took in over the December break. Empire of the Sim is, in all senses of the word, a ·movie. Spielberg, in .:alla boration with playwright \rom Stoppard, turned J.G. :Ballard's novel into a Dickensian surreal experience tb.at was both a feast for the ~yes and the s<1ul. This is one film that should remain in it's cinematic medium and eschew the video-cable market. Empire is a \big screen\ work, and should stay as such. works. Sally Kirkland delivered an Oscar calibre performance in Anna. The film, co-starring super model Paulina Porit- zkova, told the story of an aging Czech film star who can't find an acting job in America, in ber friendship with a young girl who becomes a star. Also, the makers of last years \My beautiful Laundrette\ provided an excellent slice of the amalgam of life that inhabits the ghettos of London in Sammy and Rosie Get Laid. .

' William Hurt And Lee MaNin In Moscow's peaca-iul Gorky Park, three cOrpses are found frozen in the snow, their faces and their fingers missing. How do you identify the victims, let alone find the killer? ·~ i Broadcas! News, Albert llrooks' serio-comedy on the state of network journalism, is S()mewhat of an overated clisappointment. Yes, ~ Holly Bunter, William Hurt, and Sames Brooks were all out- standing in their respective roles, and Jack. Nicholson's eameo as the gvd-like an- ehvrman was priceless. Yet, as fine as the performances were, the movie seemed to have gotten out of hand towards the end. As usual, comedies were big on the Christmas list, with plenty of ·big name stars filling their ranks. In Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, director John Hughes broke away from the teenangst genre to produce a decent light farce. Steve Martin and John Candy provided some fine moments, but the movie was plagued by long gaps of emptiness. Throw Momma From the Train, the take off of Hitchc<~_ck's Strangers e~n a Train. too, suffered from long stretches of audience boredom, I thought it did display a couple brilliant flashes of comedy. Leonard Nimoy displayed a hidden gift for easy comedy in Three Men and a Baby, blen- ding the talents of Steve Gut- tenberg, TQm Selleck and Ted Danson into an ~njoyably funny film. ~so earning mention is Overboard, the silly ,stupid, yet sometimes hysterical vebicle starring Goldi Hawn and Kurt Russell.

AIDS is an extremely com- ·plex and terrifying disease that we cannot ignore. A recent article in the New York Times cites there is greater com- plexity to the already ani· biguous nature of the disease. The article suggests that today's information on AIDS is biased toward homosexual men. It is based upon findings from various experts in the field of AIDS. The main reason for the concern about improper findings centers on the fact that Welcome ,Back · Science Fans! 1 almost all research on AIDS h~s been· on the readily available population of gay men. Many scientists fear that the testing done on these gay men may not Administration to be ad- ministered to AIDS patients. However, some experts fear that even though AZT has had positive results on male homosexuals, it could prove dangerous to the other groups. Durg users are especially at risk because they experience many illnesses connected to their intravenous drug use. Overall, AIDS researchers all see the need-for a more widely based research field. There is, however, a dilemma in rec- tifying the situation. The ar- ticle's author, Gina Kolata, suggests setting up research clinics in lower class- urban areas. This would help reach the large drug-using p<ipulations found there.

CONCORDlENSIS, January 14, 1988 Page 19 ... Must Overe~me Injuries, Sickness Women Hoopsters Looking to Break the .soo· Mark By ELLEN TAPLEY Women's Basketball at Union; under the ditection of headrcoach Bonnie Gehling and assistapt coach Boe Catller• wood, are looking tb face· the secondthird of their 1988 se(lson 1 with. the optimism and en• ' thusiasm of attaining an over .500 seaSOR. Having already practiced for two months; the team haS' compUed a two and three· record, a ownber which doe . .s: not truly reflect the tem11' s potential,. as they are playing teams who have already .par- ticipated in twelve to . fifteen games thus ·far. Along witll this drawback, tough luck bas plagued tl:te Dutchwomen as· injuries, sickness, and a C()n· stantly changing per.s~nnel have taken their toll this first part ·of the season. Gellling remains hopeful as she feels· that there have .been m1111y \brigllt moments'' in the games,. and that her ten·W()man team.~ ~as ret to \'gel something she expects to happen in the near future. And the talent is indeed the~e, for with ltlanr returning players, and a few versatile new ones, the team hcas shown its unique ability to maintain a cert~ competitive spirit as well as to persevere as a unit despite all deterrants. Individually, Gehling is looking to ner three captains, Colleen D11ndon, Julie Gallo, and Micllele Van Patten, for experienced play and leader- ship . in their various positions, Dundon, wbo shines as an of· fensive threat, brings much talent to the court; while Galli> alternates her .prowess in both the point .guard and forward positions. This facet of in· terchanging positions is not unique to Ju:lie,. as almost all the players are forced to learn at least two (if not three) positions, so that all com· binations might be employed if needed. Michele Van Patten, a dedicated four year team Speaking of Sp.orts .. By CARL R. FRIEDRICH JR. The 1987;.& school year has not been very glorious for U\ni.()n College athletics. With the exception of the woman's field hockey team, no Union team has seen post-season play while struggling through their own mediocrity. OneofUnion'S:rn()st hailed teams through recent years, the men's hockey team, is no exception to \the l>\ULsllit for .500 club.\ After dropping their first seven games, the hockey team has gene on a short tear, v.ri:il- ning three straight going into Tuesday's Hamilton game. Despite this success, the skating Dutchmen are lacking exeCUti()n in two key areas, conditioning and penalties. When the preseason began,. it appeared that the team was working hard to get ready, b11t it somehow was not eno·ugllt. During the seven game slide, injuries and lack of meshing time were not as great a problem as blown leads. 'lbe Dutchmen crawled throllgh third periods, and as a reslllt lost several gam_es in lVbieh they held leads going into the final twenty minutes. Two ()f tbe loss~s came in overtiple games which the Dutchmen lost a lead. In last week'~; North A.dallls and Salem State games, Union showed marked improvement as far as endurance was con· cerned, which ultimately paid off in a-4 and 5·2 victories, respectively. Hopefully the conditioning aspect will con- tinue even more as the season rolls along. A team can be superiorly con.ditioned, but physical endurance is pointless in hockey if a team spends half the game in the peanlty box, as the Dutchmen have made a habit 9f d()ing. This second · great problem has tied itself together witil the endurance one and has hatwted Union all season. Union enjoys the phySical sty}e of play which hockey reqW.:res, but their· style can easily b& mistaken for dirty hockey. Senseless high-sticking, roughing, and slaShing penalties do occasionally occUl', but Union draws at least one of these infractions every period. It is trite to say the referees are tough .on you~ especially when they are right. During the Salem State game, Union spent the majority of the second and third periods killing penalties, a11d if Salem was a slightly better squad, the Dutchmen might have had a much harder time achieving victory. However, as with in- creased end~~rance, the penalty problem appears to be cleaning itself up as well, even if it is to . be done the h.ard way. The most signific~t tumaroWid for the team was wl!en one individual, when threatened by an already player uses her height and rebounding power to help both offensively and defensively. Other members of the unit are multi-talented Wendy Vincent (recently injured) and Gwen Stevens who use their speed and outside shooting to help in the guard positions. Rounding out the forward positions are Lynda Hynes and Teri Boni, who continue to prove thetr aggressive intensity and fierce desire to win in all aspects of the game. Gina Prokosch, a SQphornore newcomer, brings a lot of natural ability, good court senses, and a good positive attitudeto the team; while both freslmlen, Karin Hayes and Kate Kaufman, add height, .strong offensive moves to the lrasket, and rebounding power to the backcourt. All in all the team continues to work hard, and is counting on a muCh improved, as well as a more stabilized, rest of the season. Their next home . game is Tuesday, January 19, at 7:30. - peanlized Salem player, .simply pointed to the scoreboard (which read 5-2, Union) and skated away, classically rub- bing salt into the wounds without . having to touch the enemy. Hopefully this will start a trend that the hockey team will follow. Penalties and en- durance, in fact, demonstrate a remarkably proportional relationship. The· more penalties a team gets, the easier it becomes for their energy to run out, and this example also allows for a low winning per- centage. It all ties together. A team cannot be successful if it is constrained by penalties. The cliches go on and on, but the fact remains. It is bad luck ~o be behind at the end of the game. ·The Union hockey team is a talented team which could and should do better in the future, but it aU is worthless if they do not improve where they can. A good team can get away with a lot against the weaker op- ponents, but against the tougher ones, such as Hamilton, Holy Cross, RlT, and Middlebury, to name a few, the Dutchmen will have to tighten the ship; or they will be blown out of the water.

With A Perspective Q,nsports By ANDREW MILLER Sports Editor From homer hankiEs to touchdown towels '88 mar just be the year of Minnesota. If I had told you a year ago that the Twins would be World Series champiQns you would have laughed at me. Well ifs only , two and a half weeks befCJre the Super Bowl and I'm tellir1g you to get ready to watch th~ con- fetti fly through the cold Min- nesota air again. The Vikings? Sure tltey're hot, but champions? They're just not that good, right? Wrong! Streaks. are . streus, and fads come and go, bllt this is the year for the Vikings to emerge. From the land ·()l 1,000 lakes comes a team poses~d. Losers of their last three out of four regular season games, the Vikes slid into the playoff picture with a little help froin their friends in Dallas. The Cowboys season ending victory over the St. Louis Cardinals opened the back dCJor for Minnesota to enter the playoffs. The Vikings are a team of streaks. The Vikes dnlpped each' of their three scab games, nullifying their fast start . .At 8-7 they entered the playoffs on a losing note, blowing a l~int fourth quarter lead to Washington. So who is this team playing in another stratosphere for coach Jerry Burns? lb:e Las Vegas betting line is in a frenzy after taking a beating .on their game spreads in consec11tive weeks. The 44-10 rout of the reborn Saints should have turned a few heads. Last Sunday's 36-24 ripping .of the 49ers, a 10 and a ~alf point favorite, has made some believers. The Vikings are for real. The Vikes are the hottest team in football and on their way to avenging four Super Bowl losses. Here are the facts. The offensive line has come together as a unit to rein- vigorate a weak gound game; In the Niner game the Vikes rolled up 117 yards on the ground, 397 overall. The defensive line is simply over- powering. The purple people eaters have been stunting, blitzing looping and twisting their way to tile heart of the opponents pockets. The defense held the high-flying Saints to a measly 10 points then came back the next Week and knocked all-pro quarterback Joe Mon· tan a out of the game in the third quarter. Putting points on the board appears to be no trouble for Jerry Bt.lr'Ils' high-flying offense. The quarterbacking tandem of Wade Wilson and Tommy Kramer give the team depth and experience at the pivotal signal calling position. Wilson exploded for 298 yards completing 30 of 34 passes. Wilson's main target was the NFL's best l()ng~ball threat (24.3 yards per catch) Anthony Carter. Carter caught 10 passes for 227 yards, a record for playoff yardage. I warn you now, don't be taken by surprise. The Vikings are this year's Cindererella team. The ingredients are in the pot, the Vikes at·e hott it's time to turn up the heat and make some believers. Mets and Yankees Welcome Jack Clal\k to.New York By ROBERT GOLDMAN The Yankees signing of Jack Clark bas apparently enlla!lced the chances of both New York teams winning their respective divisions. Jack Clark is 1111 awesome right-handed power hitter Wllo had pu.t great fear in the likes of Dwight Gooden and Ron Darling. Clark had hit ()Ver 300. in his career against the Mets. The Yankees will probably have Clark hit behind Mattingly in the number four spot as a designated hitter. This will also help Mattingly 'i11 his quest fQr another batting· title. Pitchers will no longer be able to pitch aro1Uld MattinglJP. If they do. they will be forced to face the likes of Clark and Winfield. Making Clark a designated hitter is smart. for two reasons. Firstly, Clark: is a defensive liability at first base and in the outfield. He will never be able to replacethe gold glove of Mattingly. The seoond reason is the fact .that Clark is injUry prone and keeping him off the ·field decreases his chance of injury. The important thing for the Yankees is for Mattingly to stay healthy; In tlle meantime, D~vey Johnson, the manager of the Mets, is deeply gratified b3' the signing of Clark. Clark's former team, the St. LDuis Cardinals, gave the Mets the most dif· ficulty last season. Powered by the offensive threat of Clark, the Cardinals were able to win the pennant. However when Clark was injured during the month cf September, the Mets nearly caught up with the Cardinals. Perhaps this is a foreshadowing ()f what is in store for the Mets. The teams that are in the Mets' division are all young and need a couple of more years to become bonified contenders. For example, the Montreal Expos were a young and talented team last year that eV'entually faded due to their lack of experience of \pennant pressure.\ . The Yankees will be stren- ghtened ·greatly by the acquisition of Jack Clark. However, the Yankees do not have the pitching staff to carry the team. The Mets seem to have both the offensive power and pitching expertise to win their division. I would expect the Yankees to make further attempts to bolster their pit· ching staff. Perhaps the Yankees will sign Met starter John Candaleria, which will weaken the Mets and possibly help offset the absence of Jack Clark in the National League. ~\lllJ.)!f.>®rr~ Udlmft®ffi ~!f.>®rr~~ • ...

Terri Thomas and Candy Mills were the brightest stars for the Dutchmen, as they set school records in their first collegiate meets. \fbomas and Mills led bye Lady Dutchmen to a split of their meet. Union scored 36 points, behindhost Williams' 70, but ahead of Hamilton's 28. The men's team also finished second in their meet, scoring 56 points, topping the Epbmen's 48, but behind the Continentals' 66. feet 9 inches). With 12 of their 22 members freshmen, much of the men's team's s:uccess Will hinge on the performances of the younger By MARK VANBUREN The Union Conege men's basketball team struggled through its first five games before Christmas break ancl picked up right where they left off this past week. A second place finish ill the Capital District Tournament started things rolling, After crushing .Albany State, f!G-67, the Dutchmen turned right around and dropped a 1)8.4)6 decision to RPI in the cham- pionship game. Two more close defeats followed, an 82-80 l4Jss to Hobart and a 77-69 loss to Rochester the following evening. Union ended the 1987 portion of its schedule by beating Plattsburgh State, 76- 69. On top of the disappointing 2- 3 start, the team was also plagued by injuries to senior Kurt Fox and freshman Elgin Rhodes. 'lbe new year didn't seem to help things out too much and neither did playing at home where Union has been virtually unbeatable the last couple of seasons. Hartwick College came into Memorial Fieldhouse and came away with a 76 .. 72 victory in much the same way it did two years ago. The c<1ntest was close right from the start. Hartwick opened up an 11-8 lead 5 minutes into the .game after Anders Kuarntnyr converted an offensive rebound into a basket. Union went ahead 20-Ul, 4¥.! minutes later when Joe Romer connected from 13- feet out. The Dutchmen opened up the largest lead enjoyed by either team in the first half, 26-22 when Steve DeBalso canned 2 free throws at the 3:23 mark . Hartwick outscored Union 1~ in the remainder of the half; both teams entered the locker room at half time tied 32-32. Union came out in the second half shooting very poorly and with 11:27 to go in the game, Hartwick opened up a 48-39 lead. 'The warriors still had an 8 point lead, 58-50, after Dylan Kelley converted a 3 point play with 7:26 left. Hartwick remained in control the rest of the way as the Dutchmen never got closer than 3 points as they were dealt their 4th loss ()f the season. Dylan Kelley led Union with 2:2 points, while Joe Romer .., added16. The Dutchmen bounced right back after their loss to Hart- wick, faced with the task of defending the Union In- vitational Tourr.~~nt Union Coach Dick Scanlon championship which they won last .season by defeating Get .. tysburg College and Con .. necticut College. In the first round Union was matched against Haverford College. Union jumped out to an early 31 ~ 10 lead j.ust 7 minutes into the game, thanks in part to 7 three- point field goals, including 4 by Mark Trudeau and 2 by Tom Beck. Converting 73 percent of their 1st half field goals didn't hurt either, as the Dut .. chmen raced to a 58-32 halftime advantage. The second half proved to be more of the same. With 15.:42 to play in the game, the Union lead reached 33 points, 72-39, after Doug Gregory hit from 10 feet out. Joe Scott's basket with 2:06 left upped the Dutchmen's margin to 40 pOints, 91-51. When it was all over, Union had completed a 9a-57 thrashing of Haverford. Dylan Kelley, with 16 points, led a well balanced scoring attack which saw .five Dutchmen score in double figures. .Bill Peck followed Kelley with 13 points. Mark Trudeau (12), Tom Beck (11), and Joe Romer (11) closed out the double figure scorers. 'lbe Dutchmen met Franklin and Marshall in the cham· plonship g8IIle. The first eight minutes of the game told the whole story. Though trailing only 22-16, Union had bloWJI nUIIierous scoring opportunities and chances to be in control of the game~ Instead; Frapklin and MarShall turned 12 Union first half turn()vers into 14 points, as the rest of the half belonged to the Diplomats. The Dutchmen trailed 41-24 at halftime. Franklin and Mar- shall's largest lead of. the game came at the 7 :~6 mark when they led by 2Ji. I»intl3, 68-43. From there, Union got no closer than the final soore of 75-60~ Dylan Kelley's zo points paced the Dutchmen. Joe Romer was the only other Dutchman to reach double ji_gures with lU points.

Fox played. sparingly in Union's first two tames; scoring 6 points. He now has 943 career points, as he J()()ks to become only the 9th Datc::hman to reach the coveted 1;000 pt. plateau. Thomas started Union's season off on the right foot as her record <!arne in the very first event of the day, the high jwnp. Thomas' leap of 5 feet 2 inches easily won her first place. Mills set school records in both the 35 meter dash (7 .41 seconds), and the 200 meter dash (28.08 seeonds), as she W()n both of those events. Thomas added a third in the 200 with a time (28.67 ·seconds) which was also Under the old record. Although- Mills and Thomas provided the women's team with its onlY first place finishes; several other athletes put in notable performances. S~ni()r Jenny Lee picked a second in the 1500 meters (5:19.34), as well as a close third in the 800 meters, where she clocked a 2:34.09. Sophomore Clare Gins~rg:-Lytle chipped in a second place in the 500 ~eter dash (1:29~48), and Lorie Anderson added two third-place finishes, in thesbot put (23feet 3 inches) and tbe long jump (13 . athletes. The underclassmen certainly performed well for the Dutchmen on Sat~day. Fresh- man Guy Burman cleared 13 feet in the pole vault to win that event by 6 incnes. Tom Lom- bardoni added a third place, .in that event, as he vaulted 11 feet in his debut effort. Sophomores- Chip Suver and Mike Tremante also picked up their first vic .. tories of the season. Silver cleared 6 feet 4 inches in the high jump, while Tremante leaped 41 feet 10 inc.hes in the triple jump. The Dutchmen's other individual victory came from veteran Jeff Barker,in the 500 meters. Barker ran that evep.t in 69.08 se<!onds, leading from start to finish. Another performance of note came from sophomore Jeff Sitnins, who showed his versatility by placing third in the high jump (6 feet), third, in the 55 meter . hurdles (8.10 seconds), and fourth in the 500 meter dash (71.99 seconds). Junior Steve Hayes ran the 400 meter dash in a quick 52.68 seconds,. while Dave Shepard, another rookie, added a third in the triple jump (39 feet 10 inches) as well as a second in the 5ij meter dash (6.o62 seconds). The track teams will. again look to their youth on Friday night, as both teams will be in action at the Memorial Field House.

After crushing Albany State, 86-67, the Dutchmen turned right around and dropped a ~ decision to RPI in the cham- pionship game. Two more close defeats followed, an 82-00 loss to Hobart and a 77-69 loss to Rochester the following evening. Union ended the 1987 portion of its schedule by beating Plattsburgh State, 76- 69. On top of the disappointing 2- 3 start, the team was also plagued by injuries to senior Kurt Fox and freshman Elgin Rhodes. The new year didn't seem to help things out too much and neither did playing at home where Union has been virtually unbeatable the last couple of seasons. Hartwick College came into Memorial Fieldhouse and came away with a 76-72 victory in much the same way it did two years ago. The contest was close right from the start. Hartwick opened .up an 11-3lead 5 minutes into the game after Anders Kuarrunyr converted an offensive rebound into a basket. Union went ahead 20-19, 4lh minutes later when Joe Romer connected from 13 feet out. The Dutchmen opened up the lar5est lead enjoyed by either team in the first half, 26-22 when Steve DeBalso canned 2 free throws at the 3:23 mark. Hartwick outscored Union 10-6 in the remainder of the half; both teams entered the locker room at half time tied 32-32. Union came out in the second half shooting very poorly and with 11:27 to go in the game, Hartwick opened up a 48-39 lead. The warriors still had an 8 point lead, 58-50, after Dylan Kelley converted a 3 point play with 7:26 left. Hartwick remained in control the rest of the way as the Dutchmen never got closer than 3 points as they were dealt their 4th loss of the season. Dylan Kelley led Union with 22 points, while Joe Romer added 16. The Dutchmen bounced right back after their loss to Hart- wick, faced with the task of defending the Union In- vitational Tourr.~~nt first half tur!lovers into 14 points, as the rest of the h;aU belonged to the Diplomats.

In the first round Union was matched against Haverford CoDege.

Thomas started Union's season off on the right foot as her record came in the very first event of the day, the high jwnp. Thomas' leap of 5 feet 2 inches easily won her first place. Mills set school records in both the 55 meter dash (7 .41 seconds), and the 200 meter dash (28.08 seconds), as she won both of those events. Thomas added a third in the 200 with a time (28.67 seconds) which was also under the old record. Although Mills and Thomas provided the women's team with its only first place finishes, several other athletes put in notable performances. Senior Jenny Lee picked a second in the 1500 meters (5:19.34), as well as a close third in the 800 meters, where she clocked a 2:34.09. Sophomore Clare Ginsberg-Lytle chipped in a second place in the 500 meter dash (1 :29.48), and Lorie Anderson added two third-place finishes, in the shot put (23 feet 3 inches) and the long jump (13 The track teams will again look to their youth on Friday night, as both teams will be in action at the Memorial Field House.

With 15:42 to play in the game, the Union lead reached 33 points, 72-39, after Doug Gregory hit from 1() feet out. Joe Scott's basket with 2:06 left upped the Dutchmen's margin to 40 points, 91-51. When it was all over, Union had completed a 98-57 thrashing of Haverford. Dylan Kelley, with 16 points, led a well balanced scoring attack which saw five Dutchmen score in double figures. Bill Peck foH()wed Kelley with 13 points. Mark Trudeau (12), Tom Beck (11), and Joe Romer (11) closed out the double figure scorers. Hockey \fs_ Holy Cross Wome!l~s Swimming vs. S1.

Student Forum Hits The Road Opening Term Meeting Sees Discussion of Gel Time Survey \By STE:PHANlE JA~YNA The Student Forum meeting January 14 in Fox Lounge drew an audience of fifteen students, who heard the Forum go through an agenda including variollS committee reports. However, the highlight of the meeting was an Clpen discussion of the resillts of the Forum's Gel TimeSurvey at registration. During the discussion, members of the FClrum, as well as the students attending . the meeting, had an opportunity to voice opinions concerning the . survey, subsequent action to be taken by the Student ForU!Jl, and Gel Time in general. The Gel Time survey questioned students' about whether they felt they had more time to study under Gel Time, if they used the extra time to study, the difficulty of class scheduling, the effect longer classes had on their attention span, elimination of mid-week partying, the increase of reduction of academie pressure, and their academie performance for the past fall tenn. The survey also included space for general conunent& and criticism of Gel Time. Approximately 1000 students responded to the survey. Although a typographical eiT()I.'\ resulted in less than 3(){J students indicating their yea!.'\ and major on the survey, !l calculation ·Of the statistical error for each question varietl from .01- .09 indicating that the results are higtuy represen- tative of the respective years andmaiors. Forum president Michael Hiller said that exact figures were still available, but that preliminary results were complete and reflect the distribution on each question. The results are as follows. second question indicated that students were not necessarily using this extra time to study. Less than fifty percent of the respondents indicated that they used extra time to study. When ,asked if the new class scheduling allowed class material to \gel\, students generally answered with \weak disagreement.'' Responses were generally mixed in response to the ef- fectiveness of time budgeting due to Gel Time. The seniors indicated a strong disagreement that Gel Time enables effective time budgeting, whereas the freshmen strongly agreed that they were able to effectively budget their time due to Gel Time. There was also a general agreeOlent tllat the increase length of classes had a negative effect on their in-class attention span. There was a general disagreement among the classes that Gel Time did not fulfill its primary objective- to reduce the amount of academic pressure which is typically high because of the trimester system. However, all classes were in general agreement that See FORUM, page 3 Student Forum, Alumni Rep. Positions Open For Election By ELIZABETH BERLINER Petitions qualifying can- didates to run for represen- tative positiClns on the Student Forum will be available, Monday, January 25. These require one-hundred signatures from respective class members and are available from Mrs. Marra on the fourth floor of the college center. These petitions must be completed and returned to Mrs. Marra no later than Monday, February 1 in order to declare eligibility for the race. Official campaign statements are due for print in Concordiensis on February 2, and the final elections will be held Friday, Febuary5. This year two freshmen representative positions are available, one junior position and two representative places for seniors on the Alumni Council (which is responsible for the organization of alumni activities). At President Morris's dinner for freshmen on January 26, Student Forum members will be present and Student Forwn President Michael Hiller '88, will inform the class of the procedures of elections and the responsibility that membership entails. The Student Forum is com- posed of three members of each the sophomore, junior, and senior classes, two trustees, three vice-presidents\ one president, a member from the Panhellenic council, and an Interfraternity Council member. It is the principal form of student government here at Union and is primarily responsible for overseeing all student activities and com- mittees. The Forum meets weekly on Thursdays at various p11blicized locations throughout the campus. David S. Birn, Minerva Hour lecturer last Thursday. Union Graduate Discounts Impact of I.NGF. Treaty By TRACEY PRYLUCK E ~ 8 ~ Ei! CD ~ ~ Professor Donald S. Bim, a graduate of Union Class of 1959, spoke on the effects of the Euromissle Treaty, signed last month, on arms relations at last week's Minerva Lecture. An associate professor of history at SUNY Albany, Birn stated that . the treaty does very little in itself. He sees the treaty as a step in· the right direction, but expressed concern that history may repeat itself and the treaty will be viewed as an end-all, rather than the first step in further nuclear arms negotiations. Birn cited the 1922 Washington Naval Conference as a parallel to the present arms limitations agreement. In 1922, Republican President Harding lacked a background in foreign affairs as does President Reagan. There was also bureaucratic opposition from the naval department, which was concerned with costs. The 1922 treaty was the only treaty prior to the Euromissle Treaty which called for the scrapping of con- struction weapons. As Birn explained, expectations were raised after the Washington Naval Conference. It had seeDBed as if \the world finally found a way to reduce ar- maments.\ However, the Washington Naval Conference simply redirected the development of weapons. After presenting this parallel, Birn explained that the same pattern .had occurred in other anns limitations talks. The peace movement tends to \rest on its laurels once victory is achieved,\ rather than pushing for further arms negotiations. Professor Birn holds that the lesson to be learned from these negotiations is that arms control can be useful to rein- force good political· relations, but select arms negotiations cannot be viewed as isolated x goals.

January 21, 1988 Supreme Court Decision Broadens Schools' Censorship Power Over Students By DAVE GULLIVER Editor-in-chief In a decision last week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5 to 3 that public school officials may censor school newspapers, plays and other activities when (ensorship is for \any valid educational purpose.\ The majority opinion allows sch()ols to censor \school- sponsored\ activities or ac· tivities tbat are \part of the school curriculum'' and seem to carry the school's endorsement. The case, Hazelwood School J)istrict v. Kuhlmeier, began in 1983 when a public high school principal removed two pages fr()m the school newspaper, which was part of the school's journalism curriculum. It is unclear if the Supreme Court decision could possibly affect Concordiensis. The decision refers to a public school paper that was part of the school's curriculm; Union offers no journalism course5 a11d Concordiensis writers receive no academic credit. The paper also has no official faculty advisor. Concordiensis does, bowever, bear the College's symbol and name, and receives substantial funa ding from the school. WRUC, similarly, does not claim to be the official voice of th.e College, but does receive ftlilding from the schol, and its call letters refer to the school. ~llege President John Morris was in New York City this week for the Board of 'Trustees meeting and could not bE reached for comment.

They hate the Soviets for in- terfering with their struggle against the apostate govern- ment, and for being a prBnounced atheist state. They will continue to fight even if the Soviets leave. The more secular,. moderate branch is. fighting for the sell- determination of Afghanistan. The people of this faction are made up of former monarchists of Afghanistan, or folks friendly to that regime. They have an interest in taking power, for whatever reason, if the Soviets leave. Several other scenarios: the Soviets talk peace, attempt to push American public opinion against aid to the mujahideen, and do nothing about the troops. This is probably not likely because· the American public is firmly committed to the Afghcm . . cause, unless, of c9utse, the KGB plants stories of artocities by the mujahideen in the American Press.

Here, highlights of the already.;in- progress Democratic candidate race are provided. Next week, the Republican race will be reviewed. By ALEX GARDNER If pDlitics wasn't on your busy list of energizing, thought provoking topics. to follow ln 198B you really haven't missed tbat much. Despite all the hoopla and hype that had gone on for the past year or so in preparation for the choosing of our next President, neither the candidates, the media, nor the general public have a firm handle on who has the inside ~:':lot at the Democratic nomination for the Presidency. So if you have been ignoring spring training, get · ready because the regular season is just over two weeks away in the state of Iowa, home of ~e controversial Iowa Caucuses. First lets see how much you know before you become elilightened. . QUESTIONS: 1.) Name the only non- candidate whose 1984 keynote address to the '88 convention paved his way for an obvious '88 candidacy but whose refusal to riDl had gotten him more pllblicity than the so-called ·~'seven dwarfs\ who have chosen to run in his patty. · 2.) Name the RepubRcan presidential candidate whose former occupation was curing \believers\ of such diverse disease as hemorroids and )O(!kjaw as millions watched home on their TV's. '3) N1:p11e. the Republican can- didate who when the spotlight shined. on him last left us with the famous last words after an a~assination attempt on his boss \I'm in charge.\ 4:a) Name the infamous ship · Senator Gary Hart boiled his Rice on. 4:b) Name the cruise photographer. ANSWERS: l) Mario Cuomo 2) Former Tale-evangelist Pat Robertson 3) Former Secretary of State, General Alexander Haig 4a)Monkey BliSiness 4b) Lynn Amiandt Well whether you knew the answers or not, here are some useful tidbits you should know, that will prevent you from feeling left out when your friends start talking.politics. The fir$! question you _might ask is WHAT EXACfLY IS A CAUCUS? Yo11 see winners are decided in Iowa--not by the voters pulling the lever of their favorite candidate but instead, Iowans elect delegates by a caucus system which has towns throughout the stateholding boiStorous town meetings to decide which candidate will get their delegates at . the Democratic convention in .July. The winner in Iowa is the candidate who receives the most delegates. This is a very simplified ectplanation of an arcane procedure that most of the press who have to explain it to tbe rest of tbe country do not even understand. The next question is . WHY DOES ' ·A SMALL UNREPRESENTATIVE,. RE- PUBUCAN STATE LIKE IOWA GET TO HAVE AN OPENING PRIMARY? .Si.n)ply., the .answer iS they want it that way. Its good .for their eeonomr and if anyone tries to move their .primaries so they precede Iowa the Hawkeye state will just move its dates up. 'WHICH DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE HAS A CHANGE TO WIN IN IOWA? Here are the players and their chances. As meeting. Troops withdrawn, and a worldwide brouhaha made the amiir, the Soviets will have achieved their purpose of establishirig a Soviet satellite in the country. Jobn Sarron, the author of a number of excenent books on the KGB, has detaile<:l the assassination of the former President of Afghinstan, Hafizullah A.Jnin. Attempts to poison the President's fruit jUiced failed, so the Politiburo ordered a .full assassination team to do the job and do it right. Amin was killed in his bed, as well as everyone in the Palace at the· time. In the darkness, the Soviets even shOt tlleir commander, mistaking, him for a Palace Guard. Con• sider this cute coup d'etat when eondering the SoViet with- ilrawal. Consider Amnesty International'·s reporting of the Soviet u.se of \booby-trap toys'' in Afghanistan. Also consider the Bulgarian secret services attempt to kill Pope John Paul Il in 1981. It you still have the ability to think clearly at that point, enter the Presidential race. far as the Democrats go, do the names Gephart, Simon, Gore and Babbitt mean anythin~ to you?· If they do not know, they will soon because at least the . self proclaimed. old fashioned, no frills 111inois Senator PAUL . SIMON and .possibly tough trade talking Missouri Congressmen RICHARD GEPHART who has been to Iowa 106 times are both ex- . pected todowell in Iowa.

Reverend JESSE JACKSON and GARY HART are both considered exciting, and popular but. basically unelec- table: Hart for his in-the~race, out-of-the-race fiasco and Jackson possibly because he is black but mostly because of his inexperience in politics and his controversial statements throughoutthe years. Thirty-seven year old, first tenn Tennessee Senator an(i Vietnam· veteren ALBERT GORE is not evert campaigning in Iowa as .he is betting on a sweep come Super Tuesday (March 20) when 20 Southern States hold their primaries. Last question. WHICH DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE HAVE I LEFT OUT? Him name should ring a bell to· all you northeasterners .. Massachuset- tes Governor MIKE DUKAKIS has probably the best com- bination of money and support to make him a favorite, along with Hart, in the second primary, that is taking place in New Hampshire in a month. After tllat, whether his '!miracle\ with the }[assachusetts economy convinces enough people out of the northeast. that he is a capable national politician is the question. That's a quick summary of what has gone on in pre-season Democratic Presidential politics as the opening day of the regular season is now less than three weeks away Do you feelmore aware now? If you think your well Clued in then answer mr: this: Aren't you glad your home· state isn't having their primaries for .at least another couple ·of months .

Contestants will be asked to speak for 3 minutes on a randomly chosen topic. Prize money totalling $325 and award trophy No preparation is necessary. TO ENTER CONTACT: Lisa at 393-3491 Nilgun at 386-4261 or Scott at 396-4167 By Ml\RTINAMOORE and IIELENE DEVRIES The catchy title \Pot and Porn\ was enticing enough to lure a sizeable turnout to the first Cr-oss Talk debate of winter term. Dan Schult~ and Katie Hamilton introduced the right to privacy issue, setting the stage f()t\ both the debators and the students to examine and questiam their morals dealing with the legalization of marijllatJa, and the sale· of porn<lgr;aphic films. Se11i«>r- Devin Wenig presented a thollgl:lt provoking argument defelldiilg the ability of every citizEn to make the free choice of wl!ether to smoke marijuana or not. Wenig's rationale was that legal or illegal, marijuana will be used. By comparing marij~ana to other narcotics such as alcohol and tobacco, Devin ·concluded that a refobn in the adi:ninistration is due, setting a legal age limit to smoke marijuana. By outlawing marijuana, the government is interfering with the citizen's first amendment rights of tJ:1e freedom to choose. Tim Matthews also used the first amendment to defend the sale of ''mainstream\ por- nographic movies. Admitting that some porn flicks dealing with childrell and violence are harmful, he emphasized that mainstream pornogr~phy is a profitable industry which is not degrading to the participants or the moviegoer. If pornography does not oppose one's moral values, one should be free to indulge without government inter-ference. Matthews also argued that mainstream por· nography is not linked to violence. · Feeling Sick? By .JENNIFER HOLMES Have you ever visited the infirmary? Unfortunately Mom is n<lt llere to serve you chicken souJl ()t\ take care of your cold. The responsibility of getting wEll aad getting your own soup is y()tll' own! Consequently, students at Union at one time or anDtiJ.er visit the Health Ser- vices l<lcated in Silliman Hall, 2nd floor. The doctors and nlll\ses deal with a variety of illne:sses. Although students witll cdds can be found at all time.s the flu in January, allergiEs in the spring, and stres:s.related symptoms during exams are the most common ailrne11ts at Union College. Do·ctors are available two h()ur;s a day Monday through Friday. Three doctors work for the lioealth Services at Union College: Dr. Wahl who . is c:lir-ector .of emergency at Ellis HDspital, Dr. Harrington who holtls a staff position in emergency at Ellis, and Dr. Ireni who acts as the O.B. pr()grarn director at Ellis. Dr. Irene is available for women by app()lntment only. Neither docti()t'S nor nurses are ac- cessible in an emergency situation by phone. A student mmt call Ellis Hospital for u~gent ambulatory care. Ov~might services are ~vailable in the informary for seri«~US illnesses but rarely used: Sick students often use the bedfl during the day to escape noisy donn rooms. A great nwnber of treatments are available for the ill. The most frequently used is the self- care cold table which provides students free access to aspirin, Tylenol, cough syrup, Sudafed, salt and thermometers. Four . registered nurses work at the infirmary. Two are part-time. They prescribe medicine and administer health care when doctors are not available. Incisions,. stitching, x-rays and lab work can not be done at the Infimlary. Students who require these treatments must go t<l Ellis • .,Lab work and x-rays are sent to Ellis With prompt · results. A doctor or nurse can administer a pregnancy test through a blood test. Results are llSUally back in eight hours or less. AIDS testing is also available although the nurses recommend the Public Health Service in downtown Schenectady because it is better ~qwpped. The Public Health Service administers free cer· tified testing one day a week and counseling. At the in· firmary, students have access to birth control. Condoms are available and through Dr. Ireni, gynecologist, other forms of birth control and counseling are provided. Mrs. Mosher, ·a staff nurse .for seven years, began her new role as director of Health Services on January 18. She replaces 0()ris Richards who . is leaving after tell' years. Both of them think that the bealtli care at U11ion is adequate but urge students to voice their suggestions or complaints. Programs can be created to inform you ... let them know.

DON'T MISS OUR FIRST DINNER QF.1988!· Contrary to Matthews, Karen Sapio, Assistant Protestant Chaplain at Union, !=!ddressed all typ~s of .porilCJgraphy, stating that hard core potn cann()t be pennitted because of its serious repercussions on society. Sapio also agreed with freedom of choice, but she added that along . with the freed<lm comes the respon~ sibility of the individual to society. Although some people may find pornography en- tertaining, Sapio p()\nted out how degradillg tne films are to women. She concluded that this image is tl).reatening to the womans' movement. Pr()fessor · Don Spring wrapped up the debate with a short opinion acivocating privacy and protesting civil censure with respect to both pot and porn. In his view, anyone engaging in any act privately and responsibly shoUld be free to do as he or she chooses. People expressed a wide variety of opinions during the discussion. These opinions ranged from agreeing with the speakers to staunch .opposition. For example, many students saw no harm in legalizing marijuana, while others saw it as a stepping stone to harder drug use. The debate received favorable reviews from those who attended. The only criticism was that because Cross Talk was only ()De hour long, many opinions were left unh.eard. Junior John Gobron · spoke for all when he said, \I thillk it ended too early.

CONCORDJENSJS, January 21, 1988 Page 5 FEATURES ' SOme love it, others would rather leave it SCHENECTADY: Nothing· To Do and Nowhere to Do lt :QyAAR()NILAN and FRANCIS FITZGERALD Schenectady is an interesting city. Union College, Proctor's Theatre, and the Schenectady Museum draw massive hordes of thrijl,seeking vacationers to this sprawling metropOlis every year. Why, just add the Mohawk Mall, Wonder Btil\ger and three or twelve OTB outlets to that already impressive list of at• tractions, and . you've prac· tically got the cultural Mecca of the northeast! However, when we are out strolling the avenues and perusing an the quaint, picturesque shoppes, we sometimes come across per- plexing scenes. Despite all ef.forts to ex;plain these .seemingly irrational thorns in the tush of society, their true purpose remains a mystery to the average primate. Luckily, however, through years of exhaustive research (and a rand()m meeting in a local pub}, we have 'found the one individual who has· unlocked the~e mysteries. Our source, whc requested that his identity not be revealed, acquired this knowledge from decades of painstaking scientific research and experimentation (and from a dream he bad last Tuesday). In the. name of joumalistic credibility we would like to divulge our source. Since we l:lave been sworn to secrecy, we can only say that his initialS are C.harles M.anson. J One perplexity which we are referring to is the crosswalk signals that appear on every major street corner in Schenectady. You may have noticed that the WALK-DON'T WALK signs constantlY read DON'T WALK. One can wait at a street corner 'til the cows come home, and still never see that white WALK sign light up. Why is this? Is it a Fascist Plot? An act of computer piracy by a local elementary school hacker? Do Bert and Ernie r-eally pay rent? OUr secret source revealed the true reason to us. As you. well know, General Electric is the largest rnamuacturer of light bulbs in the nation, The second biggest producer, Sylvania Incor• porated, has long been using scurrilous method$ to sabotage the inner workings of the ar- tifiCial Ught giants from Schenectady. \You see,,. our guru ex- plained, \if G .E. employees are stuck for hours each morning waiting to cross the street in front of the plant, production suffers greatly. This plan has been so effective that the· inefficiency it ..,created has resulted in massive layoffs.\ Why, we then asked our source, are there two red lights on many of the traffic signals throughout the Capital DiStrict? \Is itdueto the surplus,red light bulbs from Wol'ld. War II? Do they serve some sort . of religious function? Was there a sale at Penney's?'\ The Sim- plicity of his,answer startled us. \The real reason \ he stated . . ' as he clipped his .lingernails with a machete, \for the dual red lights is tnat one means stop and the other means don't go.\ Before we had a chance to express our deepest gratitude .fer alll:lis nelp (and make him pay his share of the bar tab), our mysterious friend disap- peared into the night (actually, he passed .out under the table, but ''disappeared into the night\ sounded more poetic). And so our journey ended. We felt confident, as we walked back to our roams, that we had made life here in Schenectady just a smidgen more com- prehendable.

Shal1et A wel!~known Schenectady Corner \ New York? No Way! By MARJORIE HOFFER Features Editor$ One day a couple summers ago, I accompanied my friend to Barnard where she took care of a few things before school began. We walked around the miaute .campus, but I was still impressed with the facilities. I envied the nightlife · she described, and was jealous of her social register friends; She· pointed to a patch . of grass littered with papers, and told me with pride that was where everyone sunDa.thed. I thought of West Beach ... New York City offers its tourists and inhabitants millions of unusual sights, cultural advantages. such as museums, theater; .and .opera, amcng other things. However, I'll admit, I've become victim to four years. in Upstate New York. Manhattan used to im- press me as a city that reeked of sophistication. Even the ~tter on the groWld seemed classy, as though every cigarette butt was stoDiped out by someone famous, and every piece of .., trash was tissue paper from Saks or Tiffany's. The bwns were not homeless, but characters who provided contrast to the women in mink coats. Over winter break, I visited a potential graduate school. Instead of a calm, symetric atmosphere I was sabjected to noise, the cars, the honking, the fast pace - I wondered how could people thrive on this'? I entered Ute school, described as Ha modern · alrconditioned building,\ (with a guard at the door) that housed the school and had lunch in the basement cafeteria. I battled in line for a five-dollar tuna sandwli.ch. What a bargain. After this event, where the Admissions Officer made me feel foolish for choosing a non- lucrative major such as EngUsh, (maybe he was in· ferring I was p.ot ~oing to be admitted and I woUld need a job ••• ) I went to viSit a friend. I decided to be adventurous arid take a subway I hadn 1 t taken befor.e. It was five o'clock. I was somewhere around Penn Station. I literally thought I was going to get trampled to death by the crowds. At least with all of these people, I was safe, if not completely _ lost. Decidedly . unable to find the station, I t-ried to approach nicely dressed people to ask for directions before they went whizzing by, \I need to take the BMT uptown, I know it's near Macy's\ I explained to one person. ~ \Well-Macy's is there! Can't you see?\ She was off in a huff. IknewMacy'swas THERE, but that was not the part of Macy's that I was looking for. \I need to find the BMT up- town, it's tl}e yellow one.'' I told Someone else, neaded down to the Red 1, 2, 3. \Sorry he said with a thick New York accent, \This is the only line l know.'' Finally, a token seller steered me in the right direction. My headache was e:ven bigger than the headaches on the Excedrin ads. But in the end I arrived at my friend's apartment (the doorman let· me in). We decided to relax that night and see a 9:00 movie. At .1:30we walked two blocks to the theater. A guard {probably armed), told us to stand in line for tickets. As he instructed people went up, two at a time to purchase the $7.00 piece of paper hours in advance that would admit them into the crowded movie house. It was 8:00., we had a half an hour to kill. We bought expensive. but excellent, diet. candy.. Then. I realized I forgot my toothbrush,. so 1 was out $3.00 more. 8:30: we entered the theater. \Upstairs for MOONSTRUCK\ yelled EIJlother guBJ:'d. Two other gua-rds were upstairs ready to greet us, \MOONSTRUCK-up against the willl, begin the line- all here for MOONSTRUCK, against the wall, move it up- move-it up-\ For a half an hour, we stood in line With hWldreds of other customers seeking a relaxing evening. I heard one lady in a fur goat give intimate details about her new weightlifting regime. Behind me, a couple was arguing about the Dieaning of trust in a relationship. Next to me, my friend was having a major stomach ache. 9:00, show tirne ... Like a herd of cattle we all raced into the theater. Our goal had two aims, 1 to find seats, 2 to find seats together. We raced ahead of the crowd and were fortunate enough to accomplish what we had sought out to do Ah, sitting, \' we could finally be in peace. But no! All around us couples, friends, and families were desperately searching for a place to sit. People were racing · arowtd wildly with their hands in the air, \Two here! Two here!\ they shouted. The movie began, it was wonderful. It ended, we arrived home · fourteen dollars poorer, exhausted and thrilled that we enjoyed the show. I was thank- ful we did not need to spend two more dollars apiece on tran- sportation! I really appreciate Upstate New York. It's refreshing to be with people who have never heard of a bagel as opposed to standing in line for an hour to buy dozen of the world's most famous. Give me Schenectady. The people who follcw the speed limit. The restraurants we can afford. Dry cleaning is cheap enough so I can have clean sweaters without feeling guilty. Free parking lots. Mechanics who I can trust. Movie theaters that don't give me nervous breakdowns. And yes, even the snow I can somewhat deal with. At least Upstate, the snow is white. It is not grey with car exhaust. I can hear birds out my window. I don't have to risk getting hit by a taxi on my way to class. I don't need triple b>lted locks. So, I don't have the Museums, and, alas no Bloomingdales (just the catalogs) ... but at least I bave mY sanity!

CONCORDIENSlS, }tJnuary 11, 1988 FEATURES Union Q,ets All Steamed Up: A Reprint from 10 Years Ago ... Some Things Nev·er Change Ey .JIM DAVIS Whenever the heat's on J. Richard Mills, director of physical plant operatio~s. at Union, gets steamed up. And so do some Df the pipes tllat heat buildingson campus. Since last October, steam has been rising from an un- derground manhole between the Nott Memorial and Schaffer Library. These geysers are caused by the leakage of moisture in the soil onto the underground steam distribution pip~s. College buildings are heated by steam that is produced . by two oil~fired steam boilers. The steam is then carried. through undergr<lund pipes, that run for about a-mile•and-a-half, to the buildings. · In the ·radiators, the steam is converted into water. This conversion produces heat. The water is then carried back in another pipe to the steam boilers in the college~s central utilities plant near the com- putercenter. The pipes run alongside each other ami are encased. by a tile sleeve. The sleeve is designed to protect the pipes from outside moisture. But the tile between the library and the Nott Memorial has developed leaks that all()w ground moisture to come in C()ntact with the pipes. And when· water touches the pipe that is carrying steam, at about 250 degrees, it turns into steam. \The steam has to vent somewhere,\ Mr. Mills said. \Otherwise the pressure would build up, and it owuld be drawn into the buildings. So we opened a manhole. That's where the steam has been escaping that has been causing so much curiosity.\ Mr Mills also said that repairs-which would include replacing the tile t() prevent leakages onto the pipes and draining away water from the ground around the tile-will only take three or four days, But sucll repairs will require a shutdown of the utilities plant-an impossibility during The Financial Aid Office has 1988-89 Financial Aid Application packets available now.

The present heating system and underground steam distribution pipes were originally installed some forty years ago, according to Mr. Mills. \But portions of the system do fail,\ he said. \So we have a continuing replacement program for the pipes. The last section was replaced last smnmer.\ Mr. Mills is sorry that leaking section of tile that is causing the formation of steam didn't fail sooner. ' 4 Had the problem become apparent a little bit earlier, we could have repaired it,\ he said. For most members of the Union community the escapiQg steam is merely an interesting · spectacle. But for the em- ployees of the campus store in Nott Memorial and its manager, Holley D. Greene III, the build-up of steam can mean that they're in for a hot time. ''When the wind is right, the steam blows through the cracks in the walls into the store.\ Mr .. · Greene said. \It was a real problem when the steam first startea erupting. \There was an open vent in an outside wall of the stockroom through which the steam callle from outside.'' that vent is sealed now, but steam still enters the stockroom and the store through. the cracks in the stockroom's door leadking outside. \On weekends, it can get pretty !lad,\ Mr. Greene said. \'])he steam comesin, and it has nowhere to go. So it stays in the store, raising the room tem- perature, and condensating on everything, including the cash registers.\ · Su~h condensation of moisture can damage tl)e machines. This condition was most severe after one weekend during fall term vacation. \The. wind must have blown a lot of steam in,'' Mr. Greene said. •~we had to close the store for four hours while the machines were dried out.\ D11ring the week, while the store is open, no such steam build-up occurs. That's because people are constantly walking in and out of the store, opening the doQrs, and letting the colder air from the outside in. \t'he steam :that com.es into the stockroom is drawn out into the colder air,\ Mr. Greene said. \It's like what happens whe11 someone takes a shower. When he opens the door, the steam escapes into the colder air.\ Usually, the stockroom door leading outSide is kept closed, and the amount of steam that enters the stockroom is kept to a minimum. But dn January 3, this dvor had to be kept open to receive deliveries of books for winter term courses. \To- draw the steam out, we had a .fan blowing the steam that entered the open door into the b!wkstore.\ Mr. Greene .. said. ''We also kept the front doors to the bookstore open so that the steam would be at- tracted into the cold air outside. A lot of students wondered why we~kept the doors open on such a cold day. They Iilight have gotten chjlled, but the .steam was drawn out.\ This year's steam build-up may cause Mr. Greene and the patrons and employees of the campus -store to become heated .up, but it's by no means un- precedented. \Some portion of the tile for the steam distribution pipes leaks . just ab()ut every uear,\ Mr. Mills said. \The section between the library and the Nott memorial just happened to be the point at which it decided to leak.this year.\ -; ' BUY ,BREAKFAST IN B.ED FOR A.FRIEND Comes with your choice of bagel, dry cereal, milk,. and orange juice, or bagel, bacon, eggs, and orange juice, ONLY $3e75 Sponsored by the Union C.

Panchali is the first in a trilogy of novels written by Bibhati Banerji. The trilogy chronicles the life of Apu, first introducedas a young hero who welcomes the sight Df a train and later tries to master the world through a knowledge of science and Literature. Pather Panchali is a com- passionate story ()f a family's struggle to survive. It is ex- pressed through a young Apu' s eyes and is widely considered as one of the best films ever made about the mysteries and emotions of childhood. Throughout Ray's career his output has been prolific. Apart from his brilliant work with the Apu Trilogy (Pather P.anchali, Aparjito and Apur\ Sansar) other notable works have been Jalsaghar, Kachejunga and Charulata. Ray is supremely economical in his work. He is known for his deft powers of intuition and for allowing his films to take on an independent life. His strength in. art lies in his ability to take the predic- table, that which we have all seen before, and express it in a way which stimulates the .conscious.

Anne participated ln a prQgram ()ffered by NOLS, the National Cutdoor Leadership School, whicll sponsors terms to Kenya, MeXico, and many American destinations. The schoQl promotes learning from hands on experience rather than solely from classroom instructioll, Hence Anne did not attend classes in Kenya like most studen:ts in terms abroad on safari, lliked through . the Kenyan bcle!klands and sailed up the K:enyan coast. Anne traveled with · .a ·group of seventeen ()eople, including a Kenyan stttdent, a Kenyan guide and Americans ranging in age from eighteent()thirty-fout. Kenya isJln independent state · in East Africa. It gained its. independe])ce from Britain in 1963 and became the Republic of Kenya :in 1964. Kenya is located 011 the ea&t coast of Africa astride the equator. Thus, th~ :sun rises all year long. The mean temperature is 80° witll humidity being somewhat tempered by the coastal influence. Anne started her trip in Nairobi, thl(! capital of Kenya. Anne explained that Nair.abi appears t~ resemble any small Americaaeity, except that it is. very poor. Anne spent the equilvalent of two doU~rs and fifty cents for one night in an adequate hotel.

', CONCOR'DlENSIS, January 21, 1988 Page 9 INTERNATIONAL FEATURES The Kenya E.xperience By JULIAN SHANEBROOK About the same time as a few hundred bright-eyed freshmen were arriving at Union College this fall, Anne Rosenau, a junior at Union, was flying to Kenya to begin a twelve week term abroad in the Kenyan hin- terands. Anne participated in a program offered by NOLS, the National Outdoor Leadership School, which sponsors terms to Kenya, Mexico, and many American destinatians. The school promotes learning from hands on experience rather than solely from classroom instruction. Hence Anne did not attend classes in Kenya like most students in terms abroad on safari, hiked through the Kenyan backlands and sailed up the Kenyan coast. Anne traveled with a group of seventeen people, including a Kenyan student, a Kenyan guide and Americans ranging in age from eighteen to thirty-four. Kenya is an independent state in East Africa. It gained its independence from Britain in 1953 and became the Republic of Kenya in 1964. Kenya is located on the east coast of Africa astride the equator. Thus, the sun rises all year long. The mean temperature is 80° with hwnidity being somewhat tempered by the coastal influence. Anne started her trip in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. Anne explained that Nairobi appears to resemble any small American city, except that it is very poor. Anne spent the equilvalent of two dollars and fifty cents for one night in an adequate hatel. Television sets, refrigerators, and telephones are scarce, especially since for most of Kenya electricity and running water is unusua:J. As an underdeveloped country, a small percentage of Kenyans are educated. The .government has made schaoling mandatory, but for many Kenyans, children are needed for more practical activities such as tending cattle and taking part in ceremonies. Anne was able to meet a wide variety of Kenyans, tram urban Nairobi c1tizens to tribal people. Most tribes exist purely for traditional reasons rather than religious, as the majority of Kenyans are Christian. A few tribes, however, live as they have for hundreds of years. While traveling through the Kenyan backlands, Anne was able to meet such a tribe, the Maasi people. The Maasi wear traditional cloths in lieu of more modern clothing and live in huts made of mud and cow dWlg. In honor of Anne's group the Maasi held a traditional goat roast. Anne watched as a goat was suffocated, and then had its throat slit so some of the tribe could drink its blood. The goat was then skinned and roasted over an open fire.

The PAN', a rightist party, was invited by the ·Reagan administration to the Republican convention of 1984 and has its major following in the northern part of the nation. The PAN has the largest representation of any of the other opposition parties in the Mexican legislature. The PAN's major opponent is the PSM which is a grouping of most of the communist parties in Mexico. This party has a base of support in the southern region of Mexico and is the other minor opposition party in Mexico. In the past year, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, son of ex-president Lazaro Cardenas, formed his own political party: the Democratic Current. Mr. Cardenas announced his can- didacy for the Presidency of Mexico. This party has a socialist ideology and is mainly composed of ex-members of the PRI. These people have left the PRI because their choice for president was not selected and to show their disapproval of the present regime. Many sman opposition parties have joined Cardenas in his campaign for the presidency of Mexico. This movement bas gained a large amown oi support. cardenu' campaign is a simple one consisting of an entourage of two to three cars traveling from town to town, campaigning without the benefit of major press coverage. President Miguel de la Madrid announced last month a plan of Solidarity to confront the 'present economic crisis. This plan raised workers' salaries by 38 percent but at the same time raised the prices of services such as electricity, telephone and gasoline by 54-84 percent. The prices of 'other basic goods such as tortillas, bread. milk, etc., were also raised 30-40 percent in December. The present inflation rate which the government has printed is estimated at approximately 280 percent for the past year. The crisis that Mexico has endured for the last six years sooner or later will be a major problem for the U.S. The United States should realize that Mexico cannot endure six more years of the same style of government which has been corrupt and unable to deal with the present situation of the population. If a long term solution is not foood more and more Mexicans will be crossing the border into the United States and a revolution may occur 'which would affect the whole Central American region. .

On the other hand, America's political and social problems, especially in the sixties and seventies (the Vietnam War and Watergate and, lately, the deployment of missles in Germany) changed admiration to critical distance and frequently sharp attack and led to the expression of doubts for the future of the relation- ship. Many books written during the last decade make progress, however, toward an increasingly deeper un- derstanding of the American dilemma between dream and reality, egalitarianism and individualism, democracy and empire. The celebrations of the American Bicentennial .of 1976 and the German-American Tricentennial of 1983 had great impact on these studies of the German-American relationship and produced many volumes of essays which attest to the in- fluence of political and economic aspects on literary relations and the \Rise and Fall of Americanism in Germany.\ During the Conference talks, great stress was placed also on the beneficiary role German- Jewish emigrants played as cultural intermediaries, and questions were raised about the developing gap in the un- derstanding of political, economic, and intellectual affairs on both sides of the Atlantic, due to the disap- pearace of this older generation of illtermediaries.

Recent initiatives to promote American-German relations were lauded, most notably the establishment of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies in Washington, of an exchange program for teenagers to be sponsored by the US Congress and the West German Bundestag, as well as the establislunent of three new Goethe Institutes and thr-ee new Max Kade Institutes for Ger- man-American Studies in the US.

It has been creeping into our everyday lives,_ in parents• scrutiny of rock lyrics, in: the goverilment's treatment of employee books, and on the college campuses. But no matter what the radicals said, we always thought th~t. the First Amendment of the Constitution, \Freedom of speech,.'' would protect us. But now the radical right on the Supreme Court has decided that the authors of the Constitution intended school authorities to be able to shut down the ideas of young minds whenever they see fit. School officials can censor any school-sponsored activity for \any valid educational purpose.\' A real concrete definition, right? We're not writing this just for ourselves; this is for everyone. It's a sign that the whole view of society on censorship is slipping. Once the Supreme Court permits broad powers of censorship, our boundaries will gradually be restricted. It gives more power and justification to the already self-righteous book- and record burners. Theywill be that much more vocal, that much more believed. And their momentum will build. Gradually, more officials and·more groups will attempt to restrict our . freedom of expression. The most' frightening part is that we will start to question ourselves. More and more often, writers, actors, . artists, the people cause society to re-evaluate itself, will ask themselves \Can I do this?\ More· and more often they will answer themselves, \No.\ Wake Up! For the past few years there has been a problem with Student Forum elections. Something has been missing from the election ballots. Names. Last spring two vice-president candidates ran unopposed, and only two people ran for president. Only one person ran for the three sophomore representative spots and no one ran for the vice-president for academics position until a second election was called. This would seem to indicate that students are satisfied with the quality of their lives and the education they are receiving at Union; either that or they just don't care. It indicates that they believe the Administration understands student needs and will act in their favor without guidance or prompting. Wake up!

Catherine Markes, '88 Hart: Style, Not Substance By ROBERT WAXMAN: Gary Hart's re-entry into the presidential race last month was a surprise to everyone, and a rather unpleasant on.e to his Democratic running ma-tes. One aspect of his re-entry wllicb I fotmd particularly Slll'prising was the reaction of the American public. Just a few days after the announcement, public opinion polls showe him ahead of all the Democr;ats. What does this say about the American public? Does this mean that the public is willing to forgive and forget Hart's moral outrage of last spring and appreciate Hart for his ideas and his stand on issues?' I strongly doubt tb~t the voters can appreciate Hart for bis position on . isslleS, because be does not -seem to 'have any. !Jart says he re-entered the race TURN TO PAGE .TWO EVERY WEEK FOR CONCORDlENS IS NEWS ANALYSIS All Letters, to the Editor must be typed double -spaced and submitted by 4 p.m. each Tuesday. before:· publication.

However, not. only does Hart have a vague agenda, but the public's attention has shifted from the issues to the sex scandal. Hart believes be is best qualified for the Presidency because of his positions on the issues. However his stands are very similar to those of his opponents and his proposals have a way of turning into elusive concepts. Hart's \new vision\ is composed of fancy titled terms such as \enlightened engagement,\ \strategic investment initiative.\ and \enlightened internationalism.\ These terms· sound very potent. However they are just simple approaches to complex foreign and domestic problerils ranging from the Communist threat to the economy. In ad- dition they are vague and have a strong tint of Wloriginality about them (although we all know he takes a touch stand on right to privacy). So how is one really supposed to judge Gary Hart? There is not much to udge, except for his character and his character is not something one should try t<J emulate or trust. Having such a moral delinquent in office would not only be an embarrassment t() the Democratic party b11t also an embarrassment to the nation as a whole as other countries would look down in disrespect. Taking all this into c<Jn- sideration, it does not surprise me that presidential hopeful Gary Hart cancelled hiS engagement to speak at o11t prolld college.

It has been creeping into our everyday lives, in parents' scrutiny of rock lyrics, in the government's treatment of employee books, and on the college campuses. But no matter what the radicals said, we always thought that the First Amendment of the Constitution, \Freedom of speech,\ would protect us. But now the radical right on the Supreme Court has decided that the authors of the Constitution intended school authorities to be able to shut down the ideas of young minds whenever they see fit. School officials can censor any school-sponsored activity for \any valid educational purpose.'\ A real concrete definition, rig11t? We're not writing this just for ourselves; this is for everyone. It's a sign that the whole view of society on censorship is slipping. Once the Supreme Court permits broad powers of censorship, our boundaries will gradually be restricted. It gives more power and justification to the already self-righteous book- and record burners. They will be that much more vocal, that much more believed. And their momentum will build. Gradually, more officials and more groups will attempt to restrict our freedom of . expression. The most frightening part is that we will start to question ourselves. More and more often, writers, actors, artists, the people cause society to re-evaluate itself, will ask themselves \Can I do this?\ More and more often they will answer themselves., \No.\ Wake Up! For the past few years there has been a problem with Student Forum elections. Something has been missing from the election ballots. Names. Last spring two vice-president candidates ran unopposed, and only two people ran for president. Only one person ran for the three sophomore representative spots and no one ran for the vice-president for academics position until a second election was called. This would seem to indicate that students are satisfied with the quality of their lives and the education they are receiving at Union; either that or they just don't care. It indicates that they believe the Administration understands student needs and will act in their favor without guidance or prompting. Wake up! Elections will be held next month. LETTERS AND COMMENT ARIES Be Verbal Ab·out Vandalism; To the Editors: Plate glass doors kicked until they shatter, spray-painted graffiti on walls of buildings and sidewa~ks, smashed ceiling tiles, broken shower heads, hallway carpets Jittered with shaving cream and toilet paper, door locks damaged beyond repair, forced entry into a dormitory by breaking a win- dow or by use of an unauthorized key, holes burnt into wooden doors ... the list goes on and on. All ofthe above are just a few of the hundreds of acts of vandalism committed by students on our campus. S()me of these incidents stem from individuals' abuse of alcohol or drugs; others have no motives at all. Whatever the reason, I personally resent the liberty these students take to go about destroyihg college and private property. Whether you're eighteen or twenty-two, aren't you mature enough to realize when your behavior reaches a ridiculous level at which you commit acts of pointless destruction? I refuse to ignore all of this any more; I feel net only disgusted but tbreatened. We live in a small, sheltered environment where others' actions have the ability t0 influence our everyday lives. rm tired to cleath of living in the en .. vlronment of fear and violence w!Jich these acts of vandalism ·Impose upon me. If you witness an act of vandalism, don't be a- -snent ()nlooker. Please .report it. Thousands of our tuition dallars .are spent to C()Ver costs of repairs as a result of van- dalism. To the rest of you who seem so proud Df the various things you've damaged or destroyed: grow up. It's time you thought about doing S()mething a little more productive. Catherine Markes, '88 Hart: Style, Not Substance By ROBERT WAXMAN Gary Hart's re-entry into the presidential race last month was a surprise to everyone, and a rather unpleasant one to his Demecratic rwming mates. One aspect of his re-entry which I found particularly surprising was the reaction of the American public. Just a few days after the annoWlcement, public opinion polls showe him ahead of all the Democrats. What does this say about the American public'? Does this mean that the public is willing to forgive and forget Hart's moral outrage of last spring and appreciate Hart for his ideas and his stand on issues? I strongly doubt that the voters can appreciate Hart for his position on issues, because he does not seem to have any. !i&rt says he re-entered the race TURN TO PAGE TWO EVERY WEEK FOR CONCORDIENSI'S NEWS ANALYSIS All Letters. to the Editor must be typed double-spaced and submitted by 4 p.m. each .

Letters to the Editor and Commentaries do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Editorial Board of Concordiensis. because the other candidates did not bring up the issues. However, not only does Hart have a vague agenda, but the public's attention has shifted from the issues to the sex: scandal. Hart believes he is best qualified for the Presidency because of his positions on the issues. However his stands are very similar to those of his opponents and his proposals have a way of turning into elusive concepts. Hart's \new vision\ is composed of fancy titled terms such as \enlightened engagement,'' '' s tra t eg ic investment initiative/' and \enlightened internationalism.'' These terms sound very potent. However they are just simple approaches to complex foreign and domestic problems ranging from the Communist threat to the economy. In ad- dition they are vague and have a strong tint of unoriginality about them (although we aU know he takes a touch stand on right to privacy). So how is one really supposed t() judge Gary Hart? There is not much to udge, except for his character and his character is not something one should try to emulate or trust. Having such a moral delinquent in office would not only be an embarrassment t<J the Democratic party but also an embarrassment to the nation as a whole as other countries would laok down in disrespect. Taking all this into con- sideration, it does not surprise me that presidential hopeful Gary Hart cancelled his engagement to speak at our proud college .

CONGORDIENSIS, January 21, 1988 Page 11 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY Nukes, After the Treaty - Part 11 By ALAN DE SALVI() Wellt tile two men who are arguably tbe most powerful pair ·Of guys on the surface of the Earth (in terms of death and destruction, of course) have abso1utely d.y'namited their place in the history books. They signed the Treaty, eliminating all intermediate range weapons from Eurasia. I described some of tbe reasoning behincl the treaty and part of the world situation and balance, which is the direct result of n11clear weapons, in my last article, and the end of fallterm. Naw I'd like to answer some of the questions I closed with and peer inb the media blitz surrounding this definitely minor event. One of the more interesting issaes surrounding the December Ron and M~ke show was their supposed con- sideration of a 50 percent reduction in total strategic nuclear arsenals, meaning long range stuff able to hit the other guys's horne territory from your own territory or subs. I cannot emphasize the un- desirability of nuclear war to military men and planners, not to mention the man in the street. But when the alternative to ha,ring the threat of nuclear weapons is a possible planet- wide conflict, dwarfing WWII, or even a l.\elatively small scale conflict devastating central Europe, the choise is easy. We mllst have the nuclear weapons! 'lbe general peace in the world, and the broad safety on the high seas, and the overall economic and social health today, are all a direct result of the presence of nuclear weapons. Now the question becomes: how many can be safely removed? There are many esDteric fennulae based on hardness of targets, and the number oftargets, and warhead vehicle survivability, etc., but the real nwnber is how many equivalent megatons of TNY need to be detonated to eradicate the human race. Nwnbers in excess of that are superlative, basically. All of this assumes that the intent to use is strong. Cer- tainly, if one side launches against the other, the game is up. Neither the Soviets or the US will allow the other to sur- vive unscathed. But could one side initiate a nuclear ex- change? That query has historically become, will the United States launch nuclear weapons in defense of Europe (which kills us all)? You might be interested to learn that present US nuclear doctrine does launch to defend Europe, bat the big ICBMs are only launched after a careful escalation of nuclear weapons from the battlefield nuclear artillery shells on up.

• f 1\, '('~.l~.',~t-;'.\\.'Y'.I Paze 12 CONCORDIENSIS, January :tl, 1988 Slippery Water: The Questio~ Has Been Answered By I'EADDt CHAKRABARTY SlipJlery water is a strange- soWldillg name for the amazing effect that certain polymers have on oil and water. These poly-mers add great amounts of visc~slty to the flUids. However, the :final product is a f~eer­ flowillg liquid. The applications of \:lqppery\ water have been widespread; including im• proved efficientcy in oil tran• spcr-t, :fire fighting, and sewage systEms. Naval scientists have even tested their use in ship and subrn~rine movement. Still, the question has remained for ma11y years of how the ploymers work. The polymers are :i() efficient that adding only a fe\'i' parts per million will repiocuce the effect. Set, ex:catly how do these polymers work? Dr. Gregory Risldn, a Northwestern Univ~rsity professor, has r-ecently published a detailed the()r!l of how slippery water occu~. His theory involves yo- yo-lik-e molecules that ef- fectiv-ely cut down the drag. The molEc\lle.s act at the point between the object, like the ship or pipe,. and the liqtrid. At this point the majority of the drag occurs because of friction. The polymers normally stay bound up like a wound-up yo-yos but at the point of friction they extend. This extension is the primary reason 'fflr the loss of drag. For at that level the unraveling polymer molecules reach. a great length. In most instances, the smaller the length of the interactin, the more stress produced. A molecule of a liqUid without the polymer must adjust its speed from that of the liquid to that of the object it encounters. The widening of the area effectively increases the ~ime needed for the molecules to change speed. Dr, Riskin isn't without his detractors, however. His models ()( yo-yo-like molecules are quite contrcversial to other ploymer chemists who envision molecules that are elastic like rubber bands. Nonetheless, his paper had been cited as an important testimonial by the overall scientific community.

The following data is not extensive but illustrates some modern trends: In New York 30% of public schOol enrollment & 17% of undergraduate enrollment is Black or Hispanic, yet 5-6% of . first professional degrees go to these minorities. Fall of 1980 Dental School enrollment: 2.4% New York Medical School bigb school, Will enter a graduate or professioJtal education program, or will complete . such advanced training.

Page 14 CONCORDIENSlS, January 21, 1988 ARTS & FILMS B' Karnatic Music Concert Begins Winter I . . . . mprovJsatJon Ser1es By JENNIFER. ENGLAND ... Let's go see a classical music concert,'' my .. friend suggested last Fr-iday afternoon. ''Sure why not. I like Mo:zart.\ I was in for a shock however, when I foUJid that my friend had neglected to mention that it was Indian Classical 'ltlusic. Not prepare for this, I was more than a little skept\ical. My fears would be proven unfounded as I was quickly caught up in the intensity of the music during the first concert of the Winter Improvisation se~ries. Upon entering the room the. scene was set for an interesting and unique evening. A row of cushions bordered a mat 11pon which were four odd looking instruments and a bowl of carnations. The audience which siowly filtered in would prove to be a good cross section ()f the community consisting of professors, students, young children and townspeople. Tom Ross, associate profess()r of music introduced the concert and the series and the music, began. There were four musicians in the group. They were T. Viswanathan on the flute, Trichy Sankaran on the mrdangam (a two sided drlll'll), Ramnad Raghavan on the kanjira (a stringed in- strument), and Michael Nixon on the tambura (a tamburi11e ). The four men wore Indian robes , enhancing the atmosphere. The music was dominated by the flute and the mrdangam, yet the kanjira and tambura helped hold it together. Th()ugh the music was distinctly I11dian it was relatable to American Jazz in lts i.mprovisaional techniques. Each song ~on­ sisted of a basic eh()rd progression and a beat. The musicians then improvised on that structure. They seemed very close, working togethEr as a unit and playing off of each other. The third song of the five played was · a beautiful solo .improvisation by T~ Viswanathan on the flute. He was accompanied only by a tone produced electro~ically throughout the concert. this piece was particularly haun- ting, provoking the audience to respond. One gentleman .sang and several others responded verbally, still others simply rocked or trapped in time. All were encouraged to joili in. Tile fourth piece was also quite remarkable. T. Viswanathan chanted a poem in the language of Tamil which \decried the common assumption that :miraculous power is an atkibute of sain- thood, wal.'ning aspir~nts of this destruction.'' This explanation, as well as the words in both Tamil and English, were con- tainedin an ava:ilable handout. Throughout the . concert several students participated by clapping out the basic rhytlun with their hands. The drummer Trichy Sankaran encouraged them and helped them follow when he was not playing. The interplay between the audience and tbe musicians and between the musicians was clear. The concert proved to be enjoyable not just as a curiosity but as pleasant music as well. The evening turned Qut to be truly rewarding,. Mozart or not. An Evening of Poetry and Fiction ~siNGERS, DANCERS, ACTORS, MUSICIANS- Orthodox Church. In anotb.er By JACQUELINE RANDALL ~ poem entitled \Lessons The Englisll Department presented an evening of poetry and fiction on Jan. 18, with Theresa Pappas (author ·Of Flash Paper and Alive and Dead in Indiana). The two writers also spoke earlier in the afternoon for professor Jordon Smith's Creative Workshop class onthe subject of writing and editing poetry and fiction. Poet Theresa Pappas was born in Baltimore and attended Portland School of Art, the University of S()uthern Maine, and the John Hopkins University. Her collection of poems have appeared in the Antioch ReView, the Denver Quarterly and ether journals. She currently teaches at Tufts University and edits and publishes Story Co-unty Books with Michael Martone. Fiction writer Michael Martone was educated at In- diana University and John Hopkins. He ta11gbt for several years at Iowa S<tate University where he edited Poet and Critic. Martone is presently a professor and a Briggs Copeland Lectul\er at Harvard. In her presen.tation, Theresa Pappas stressed the im· portance of the settings of her poems. Many of her poems come out of ber travel ex- periences and her childhood. Her opening peom, \Sundays described a typical Sunday spent at Church~ at an age when the character did · not un.: derstand the cl1Stoms and behavior expected at a Greek Pappas related to the audie11ce stories about her childhood art lessons, describing how mu.ch her parents enjoyed her art- work while she, .on the otller hand, could not learn to ap- preciate the beauty she had ~rea ted. Pappas' next few poems dealt with her travels, both alone and with Michael Martone thro11gh Greece. \River Sticks,\ \Wedding Songs,\ and \Ret~~rn to the Island\ were all won- derfully written descriptions of typical scenes and experiences of Greece. Although most of her poems deal with positive. and cheerful matters, her poem \From the Tower\ was con- cerned with feuding and funeral songs. Later in her career, Pappas ·lived in Maine and traveled to Iowa. The poems she read reflected her ex- periences i~ these places. The next reader, Michael Martone, read two short st()ries. Although he did not write a,S descriptively as TherEsa Pappas, his works were more hun1orous and lively. The audience, composed of twenty students, teachers, and g11ests, were constantly amused by both his stories and by the way he delivered them. Martone's obsession with Indiana is shown in his Alive and Dead in Indiana - a collection of monologues of both living and nort-living celebrities from Indiana. The first short story he read, \Return to Powers,\ Martone described Muncie, Indiana, a ARTS BRIEFS ARTS SPEAKER · Jennifer McErlean of Siena College is presenting a talk on \How we value art: is the beauty in thle beholder? The lecture will be on Friday January 22 at 3:30 pm in the Hwnanities :Bldg., room 213. This is part of the Colloquim series sponsored by the Department of Philosophy. CAFE LENA On Fridayr. and SatW'day, January 22-~, Cafe Lena, 45 Phila St. in Sar.atoga Springs, will present singer-songwriter John Gorka at 8:~ pm. Reservations and information may be obtained by phoning the cafe at 583:-00!2. RENAISSANCE MUSIC AT UNION Union College will play hostto the Parley of Instruments, a world famous string e~nsort. The performance will also feature a special appearance by Paul O'Dette, who is a world renowned Lutenist. The concert will be at the Union College Memorial Chapel on Smday, January 24 at 3 pm. Featured in the performance will be music from Biber, SchElzer, Pachelbel, and Vivaldi an!l all music will be played on original instruments. Tickets are $8 ( 4$ for students). · STREET SINGER TO APPEAR ATUNION Steven .Baird, a well traveled street performer will bring his act to the Union College eampus Friday afternoon, January.!2 at 4:30pm in the College Genter · Atriwn. Baird is known foe his · variety of instnunents, stron'g· voice and large repertoire of songs. ) typical Mn.erican town. In Martone's final reading of the evening, he read a cDn- troversial story \Highlights': describing a narrator's ~e~­ periences · as a dentist in California. This story was never published due to the fact that the nar-rator bore a strong resemblance to the olrmpic swimmer, Mark Spitz. Altllollgh Martone never mentions Spitz's name, any reader who kn()WS anything at all about Spitz's .life would quickly see that the narrator was indeed Mark Spitz. Theresa Pappas and Mi<:bael Martone bring both the \strange and the familtar\ together. Although Pappas' presentation was slower and more serious than Martone's light,.bearted reading, .both authors, monologues captured the audience's attenti()n. and provided great entertainment to the Union College campus. This event was sponsored by the English Department and was made possible by Poets & Writers, Inc., which is fllllded by the Literature Program of the New York State Ccm!lcil in the Arts. ·PIPPIN is coming Auditians begin Feb. 1 For Info.· call x 4264. .I:bJt bl. ·~ oo\- in -lht.. Cdtd \A Call to Act\ By MICHEU.EMARATI'O One of the nicest things about being a st11dent is the fact that in college you can try anytlllng. So I put it to you here and mw - why not try theatre - par· ticipating in theatre~ that is. Theatre at Union will be thriving next term so n~w is a great time to think aoout get- ting involved in the upeoming events. · Mountebanks will be doing -- Pippin for Parents Weeltend and the weekend follow:illg it. This prodilction needs a whole bunch of singers, dancers, actors, and mllSieians. Auditions will begin on · February 1, and if yo11 need more infonnation at thi::J time you can dial X4264. . The MoWltebanks will also be doing a play in the spring ealled A Resounding Tinkle by N.F. Simpson. Auditions .for this prodUction will be held next week. For more infonnation ()n this production you can call X6575. Also in the works on campus is an independent theatre project, working on a play entitled All God's CbiUWI Got Wings by Eugene O'Neil. Thi$ project involves a gr()wing group of conscientious students who are coming togetller to tackl~ s()me pretty relevant issues. All are welcome t~ stop in a~ our_meeting/auditi.()ns on Sunday, January 24 in SS014 at 3:00 pm or to call X4209 for more information. · So, as you can see, work for this springs productions is getting started early this year, an encouraging sign that there win be a lot t() look .forward to in the warmer months~ Seriously consider taking part in such things, even if you have never done· so before. My experience has shown me and many others that aU types of'theatre at Uni~nare friendly, aceessible, and not exclusive to \experienced actors.\ Getting involved can expand your horizons and help to kick the winter doldrums. No matter what side of the stage you are interested in being on, however, be sure to be on the lookout for a highly provocative . traveling proquction being done this winter by Mountebanks called Shades of Grey. You'll be sorry if you miss these controversial performances.· Als(), something to look forward to this winter will be a P.toduction sponsored by the . Social Alternatives Committee; The play is being directed by Evan Picus and David Kohl, and is entitled Working. Working is a musical, and will be performed later this tenn in the College Center Atrium. So students, don't ignore the cultural opportunities right here on our own campus. Student Theatre .is a challenging, innovative, and an enriching part of union life. •• - , r

The - audience was enthralled at once-a .reaction which lasted until the fiJlal .encores and bravos. :Especially thrilling were ''The S.quat Dance\ and \Ukrainian ·Lads.\ In \The Squat Dance~' men perfonued l.eg kicks, spins, and other 'tricks' while remaining not more than 8 inches off the ground, Anyone having tried to do the .squat dance, perhaps after watching \Fiddler on the Roof,'' can appreciate my friend's remark \No wonder their pants are so baggy, imagine the size of the'ir quadracepts.,' As the individual dancers ·perf()rmed their varied low . altitude talents the audience cheered and laughed.

Stewart's '~You're in MIC Heart.\ Throu,ghout the set, Rob's low voice and soothing guitar play W()rked well to accent COrey's delicate han- dling of the lyr'ics. The pair finished the set with \I'll Stop the World,\ by Modern English, a song which they had never performed publicly befot;e. By the · audiencte' s enthused reaction it was clear- this tllile is a welcome addition to their repertoire. The next set was· performed by longstanding Cabaret. veterans, Sean Connolly and Dave Provost. Sean kicked off the set with a song he had written just an hour before, followed by Dave with a song he had composed ()nce as a bir· thday present for someone special. Both ()riginal com· positions were enchanting and well received by the audience. In all, Sean and Dave per· Auditions for a Spring Mountebanks production formed seven songs including pieces by Bruce Springstein, The Grateful Dead and REM. In the last four numbers the pair employed a tape of the falling rain as an \atmospheric catalyst'' which they used to promote the .effects of security and warmth. The audience appeared moved when Sean and Dave performed an original that they explained was about \a girl with green eyes.\ The set ended with a remarkable version of a classic by Jimi Hendrix. Sean~s digitally delaye.d guitar solo was played intensively and procured a special round of applause from the audience. The entire set was performed with the ease and talent for which these two Cabaret veter-ans are known. Cabaret is performed every Thursday evening at nine o'clock in the College Center Atriwn.

Eddie· becomes (:m · unwilling pawn in a deadly game of my- stery and mysticism when: he. agrees to track down a tribe's sacred child! BETIEROFF DEAD Jan. 27, Wed .. 7,9,11 -John Cusack At first glance, Good Morning Vietllam ~eems to be playing a very dangerous game by at~ tempting to bring a humorous aspect to such a serious.issue as the Vietnam conflict. This iS especially sensitive considering the latest media trend of ex- ploring the tragedy of that era as seen in the productions of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. Any less of a performi;lnce would have left Good Morning Vietnam subject to a barrage of criticism, but the picture succeeds in displaying the perfect balance between humor and reverence for the men involved. ·· Yet, through all ()f the laughter the realistic side of the war is explDred. Cronauer finds himself surrounded with the corruption of government censorship, death, a:nd the relentless struggle of pride that tears the land and its families apart. His contact with a young Vietnamese brother and sister gives insight ihte the Viet- namese culture and the effect of American 'OCcupation on their lives. When Cronauer. inad- vertently becomes an English teacher to an awkward group of Vietnamese, the generous and sensitive side of his character is revealed in his instruction of \proper\ American slang and the tradition of baseball. THE Lane Meyer (John Cusack) is certain that suicide is the only answer when his girlfriend dumps . him. However; his foolish attempts: only cause mo.re embarrassment, until 'he meets a girl who g.ives him • . a reason to live. The film focuses on the ex- perience of Adrian Cronauer, (Robin Williams), a military DJ sent to Vietnam to raise the morale of the troops with .a few laughs. His unique style soon captures the hearts of the GI's as he brings controversial rock- and-roll to depressed spirits and sarcastically toys with the American government. His off- color remarks involve voice impressions of renowned citizens from Richard Nixon to Jim Nabors. His light-hearted attitude, both on and off the air, brings a refreshing touch to the disoriented lives of the . Robin Willia~s' performance is simply incredible. He truly 1 fulfills all aspects of Cronauer' s character from the comic to the concerned, while producing the dramatic depth needed in the . emotional scenes of suxviv:al. His talent is purely inexhaustible, though at times he leave the audience a -little breathle5s. Throw in the musical talent of James Brown and other voices from the era and you've got a movie that should keep 'em lining up at the boK office for the next few months. THERE•s STILL TIME!

CONCOR.DJENSIS, Ianuory 21, 1988 Paae 19 Athlete of the Wee·k With A Perspective On Sports By CHRIS HINCKLEY Over the years the Union CQllege Skating Dutchmen have traditionally started slowly and picked·upthe pace as the season progres11ed. This year the Skating Dutchmen seem to be · taking this tradition to its ex~ tremes. Mter a first semester start of 0.,7 the Dutchmen have gone 5-1 in the second semester. Their reent wins have shown .flashes of brilliance that had not been seen in. the beginning of the season. It is obvious to the fans that the team is playing much better and working twice as hard ontheiee. · Whatever the reasons are for the team's success is, this new attitude is evident in the per- formance of the players and. some in . particularily. Senior Captain Scott Cyr is a perfect example. In the team's pasttwo games Scott has scored 4 goals and 4 assists for· a total of 8 points. Scott's success in the last' week of hockey has earned him the distinction of tieing named Athlete ofthe Week. Last week, against Holy By CARL R. FRIEDRICH, JR .. I recently read an editorial in Newsday eLong Island's Newspaper') on greatest s~orts feat of all time. The writer came to the conlusion that Bob Beamon's 1968 Olympic and World. Record was the ultimate. While this opinion is clearly acceptable, there is no way a single event can be singled out as above all others. Beamon's feat is in a class of its own, but in my oplmon, it was only among the best. Every list seems to forget someone .•. and I am sure my own is no exception, there are a few isolated events in the world of sports that stick out more than any others. The first, though in no particular order,·is from the sport of basketball. In 1964, UCLA began an amazing streak By MARK ZIMMERMAN The 1987-88 football season is rapidly approaching its finale which wiD see the Washington Redskins behind the leadership of Doug Williams take on the Denver Broncos AKA; The Denver Elways. This season has not exactly been an or- dinary one frotn anyone'spoint of view. The season saw a 3 game player strike, the, retirement one of the best, if not the best, r~g baQk in the history of football, and the success of several teams that ,. used to be nothing more than lousy. Although many people :believe that the player's strike ruined the season, this is aliDost .completely false from a statistical point of view. If you compare the standings before and after the strike, you will see that most teams finished in roughly the same place. Granted, there ate a few teams that suffered during the strike such as the Giants and Vikings. · However, following the strike the Vikings reswned .their in- . ( Scott Cyr Cro~;s, .Scott :had ·~ goals. and 2 assis~ to lead the Dutchmen to a 6i.! win. Later tbe same week the Dutchmen met Geneseo state. Geneseo was looking for its first win ever aginst Union but it wasn't meant to be. The Dute)llnen .came back from a 3- point frist period deficit to reco:rd a 6-4 win. In the game Scott again had 4 points with. even. amount$ of points and goals. Scctt has been a member of the V:arsity squad since his freshman year and he's been performing well all along .. In his first three years Scott played in a total of 83 games and bad 45 points (25-2().,45). As a result of this hard work and per- formance he was named Co- Captairl of the squad for his senior year. As a senior at Union, Scott is an electrical engineering major and a brother at Psi Upsilon. Fraternity. He hails from Amesbury MA where lle attended Amesbury High School and captained the Hockey team. Scott al~o at- tended Vermont Academy before coming to Union. Congratulations again to Scott Cyr for his fine per- formance in the last weekend, and good luck to him and his teamates in the rest of a promising season of hockey. HONORABLE MENTION.: Freshmen forward Terry Campbell, Nepean, Ontario, recieves honorable mentioQ this week for his outstanding pefonnance in the Dutchmen win ·over Geneseo State. In that game Terry scored' 4 points and recorded a Hat Trick (3 goal). Speaking of Sports of lli11e out of ten national championships, including seven strai:gJttfrom.1967-73. This feat is incl\edible considering that at a leveJ s11ch as college, players are c10ming in and out at a contfut:uaUy intense rate. It is equally outstanding considering the llig.h level of competition UCLA 'faced over tliat era. · · Wl1ile UCLA's ac~ compllsbment is noteworthy, even their seven year reign is not as dcnnnant as the tally Brazil acilieved in soccer from 1958 oo 1966. Brazil won two straigot World cups during that span,. domillating the world for eight years. Tbese post war squads produced pl.ayers like Pele, the King,· and Carlos Albert(), and Jazerinhenic, all consi.O.ered the best at their game, In addition, these championships had two un- derlying factors in BraziPs disfavor. Both cups were staged in Europe and inboth com- petitions, th~y were considered underdogs. · These events are practi~any unparalleled in team sports, but tfiere are those who stand out on their oVill, individuals who rose to the top without the depen- dence of others. Erie Heiden is one ofthe few athletes who have no peers. In 1980, he was speed skating. Heiden won fiv:e out of five gold medals, and coupLe with the Hockey team's 'miracle on ice,' gave the United Stat-es its best showing ever inth.e winter games. Another individlllll, Rocky Marciano, did it all as well in boxing. In 1952, Marciano defeated Joe Walcott and held the heavyweight title until195Ei.

In an interview with NBC a~filiate WRC. TV in Washington D.C., Snydei', age 70, was asked for his comments for a program being produced to honor the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. S!lyder remarked that the blacks superiority in athletics ,stem- med from. strength breeding, dating back to the Civil War, \the slave owner would breed his .big black with his big women· so that he would liave a big black kid.

Mar- ciano is amazing becawe he was an undefeated champion, retiring without having lost or tied a bout. These events are un- paralleled in all of sp~»l't. In today's world especially, the odds and technology are overwhelmingly against any equal feats. College or pro basketball has not had a repeat champion in years, nor bas or probably ever will soccer. Innovations in individual sports like skating and boxing have left dynasties· a thing ()f the past. These facts only s11pport the appreciation of the men- tioned histories. No one can deny their prominence, and while some events come and go, tllese will · reamin forever. These people and teams are history. Not In the Box Score tensity and played excellent football. In the end, although it took a little help from other teams, the Vikings managed to clinclt a well-deserved playoff spot. ()n the other Qand, the Giants ;played horribly both before and after the strike and did llllt deserve to make the playoffs no matter what their repla~:ements did. On the whole, the teams that were playing well ~fore the strike managed to smi.ve and prevail at the end of the season also. The teams that were lousy before the strike. also .returned to their spots in the bottom of the standillgs following the strike. The effects of the strike hit the i\li'C East tbe hardest. At one point during the season all five teams had the same exact recorll. The strike left the patrio.1S down following two scab bosses, yet the rest of the divisif)n was no better off either. The truth to the matter is that each team in the East con· trollell th.eir own destiny an<l onlytlley.are to.blame. The Jets went iflto:thei:t usual late season nose-dive, the Pabiots lost a \ few close games that they should have won, the Dolphins were never really in it and the Bills played err.atically.You have to give a lot of credit to the Colt management for aquirl11g Eric Dickerson in a mid-season trade. His success and leadership on the Colts proved the trade to be one of the best in NFL history. The Rams made out well· also as Charles White, Dickerson's replacement, went on to lead the entire NFL in rushing. · This season had a dimension to it that the NFL hasn~t seen in years; the emergence of several teams as future powerhouses as well as th.e success. of older teams. On tl1e whole, this Will lead to more competitive games in the near future. For example;. the Browns, Colts, Vikes, Seattle, Eagles, Oilers 8Jld Chargers all emerged teams with stong futures. In addition~ teams sueh as the Bears, Redskins, Patriots~ Seattle, and San Francisco showed that the older teams are still just.as powerful. The division races this year were some of the closestto date and next year could resultin the same thing, the only dtfference is that next year people won't have a strike to blame things on. This season wil als() be remembered for crnother reason. Walter. Payton l)layed in his last professional game.

For· tunately however, this is not IIow he will be remembered. for the white peopl~.\ Snyder was quickly ousted by CBS sports where he has been the networks oddsmaker for the past 12 years. Before the start of the ''NFL Today,'' the show in which Snyder worked, Brent Musburger, CBS' managing editor, apologized to the viewing audience and stressed the fact that Snyder's com- merits in no way, ''reflect the thinking or attitudes of the rest of us here at CBS sports.'' Snyder, who later met with presidential candidate and Civil Rights spokesman Jesse Jackson, promised t() send letters of apology to black athletes and others. Jackson criticized Snyder's · remarks, saying were \scientifically untrue and regrettable.\ Jackson went on to praise Snyder for his apology, call Snyder's plan to write the letters as \admirable and the right thing to do.\ Jiniiny \the Greek\ Snyder's ill-remarks come 9 months after Los Angeles Dodger e~ecutive AI Campanis made inflammatory remarks about the status of blacks in sports and their lack of some of the \necessities\ inv:olved. in qualifying for high level management jobs in professional baseball. Snyder and Campanis' remal'ks are blatant reminders of the narrow sterotypical thinking that still exists in this country today. 'l'he comnionly believed stereotype that blacks are naturally gifted athletes transcends all professional sports~ Blacks are considered products of evolution, advantaged athletes becaue of a \natural edge.\ The admirable work ethics of the black athlete have been ignored by tho~ in high-level .positions around professional sports. This type of thinking has been carried over to discriminate against blacks in ~oachillg and officiating positions. ThE! black athlete today is heralded when he leads his team to a title, but is forgotten and ignored when he applies to carry over his leadership skills to a front office job. Jimmy \the Greek'~ Snyder has paid for his remarks, but he should not be used as -a scapegoat. The Snyder incident is merely a public exhibition of the racist attitude still prevalent in American society. In a world where racism and sterotypes still predominate. one has to wonder if the message of Martin Luther King Jr. has been forgotten. Payton was the class. running back who played intensely and rarely ran out of bowtds. When Payton and Franco Harris were both approaching Jim Brown's career rushing .record, Brown frowned upon tbe fact that Harris would break his record. He openly stated that Harris, who frequently ran out of bounds instead of turning up- field and taking a hi~, was not worthy of the honor. Yet, on the other hand,Browngavenothing but support toPayton who was simply the · best. in his day.

·'· Scotty Cyr and the Dutchmen pinned. down Holy Cross in a 6-2 route of the Worceste·r Crusaders. A lost week for the Union Hoopsters Janu~ry 21 , 1988 .... Hoopsters tt-op 11 p11ir to Middlebury and SlddtmJre · Where Have All the Victories Gone? By MARK VANBUREN The Union College men's basketball team suffered through two very bad losses this past week, dropping a 9-76 decision to Middlebury and losing to Skidmore 69-60~ In both games, the Dutchmen had ample opportunities for victory, yet they failed to convert at these crucial times. Against Middlebury, Union got off slowly - scoring only 9 of their first 28 possessions - yet they trailed by only three points, 21-18, with 6:37 r~aining. The Dutchmen went into the locker room at halftime trailing 36-31. Poor shooting on the parts of both teams con· tributed to this relatively low halftime score. Five and a half minutes into the second half, the Middlebury lead was cutto 41-39after Dylan Kelley converted a lay-up. Although Union could not seem to get any loser than this two- point deficit, Middlebury could not increase its lead either as the two teams, for the most part; traded ·baskets during the next nine minutes of the con· test. With 5:17left to play, Tom Beck converted one of two free throws and 0()ug Gregory, who was fouled after grabbing the rebound off of Beck's miss, hit two free thrDws to know the score 62 -62. From there, Middlebury went on a 15-8 run to go ahead 77-70 and put the game out of reach for the Dntchmen. Dylan Kelley led Union with 24 points, while DDug Gregory added 17. Three nigllts later, Union ventured to Saratoga to take on Skidmore College - a team that the Dutclunen. had beaten by an average of 31 points in their previous 3 meetings. On this evening, however, Skidmore's determinatioll and persistence coupled with Union's poor shooting {34%) wotild cause the Dutchmen to slip to 3-7. Right from the opelling tip-off, things started off poorly for Union. After 4::26 the score was tied 6-6. Ten minutes later, Union held a slim 16-15 lead, after Dylan · Kelley hit tw() free throws. Both teams left the floor with Skidmore leading 27-25 following a very slow-paced first half. ~ The second half saw Union o11tscore Skitllnore 13-7 to run oat to a 38-34lead, just 4:49 into the period. Joe Romer's 12-foot jumper with 11:08 left to play .gave Union a 42•36 advantage. Pete Kestner's two free throws at the 4:26 mark gave Skidmore a 52-51 lead, one which it would not relinquish. Skidmore upped this lead gradually and led 63-54 with0:59remaining. From here the two teams traded hoops until the final buzzer sounded. Joe Romer's 19 points paced Union. Romer was fouled by Dylan Kelley with 13 and Bill Peck with 11.

Dutchmen Maintain Momentum lcem'en roll to two straight victories By DAVID MORRISON . The straggling Skating Dutchmen fans who entered Achilles Rink in the waning minutes of Saturday night's first period could not believe what they saw._ They had no conception of the pain the 111ore punctual fans had just endured. Is that score right? Three t() nothing against Geneseo? Union was all but playing the good solid hockey they had proven capable of. The defense> was sent into a tailspin, · allo,wing 14 shots on net and 3 goals. The first period intermission was one full of quef;tian-asking · and head-shaking. No o~e coUld. conceive what was about to take place. Something had happened in that locker room. Maybe it was divine inspiration or maybe threats of bodily harm. Whatever it was Union was about to rise to the occasion. end to end rush, .splitting the defense and popping a shot by Geneseo goaltender Phil Wheaton to make it 4-3. The score was then tied up at 4~ when Marc Goguen set up Scott Cyr with an unbelievable pass giving Cyr the open shot ·and goal. Union would take.the lead on an outstanding play . by freshman John McintoSh when he beat Wheaton outright by lifting a shot Upstairs. Union would never look back. Camp- bell then completed his first hat trick of his Union c~reer when he scored a short handed goal late in the second, assiSted' bY Cyr. After a Gene$eo goal in tbe opening minutes of the third perioi:li Logari- gave the .Dut- chmen a two goal cusliion and · his ninth goal ·of the $eason making it 7.;:). G~neseo ·scored once more op· a power play before Scott Cyr got hi$ second of the game when he score on an empty net in the final seconds of the game, the.fimil was8-6. Women Swimrri.ers Pulling T·ogether. Freshman Ten'Y Campbell was one of the sparks in making this win possible. He-ignited tile Dutchmen early in the second period with the first Union goal of the game on a pass fr-om Guy Logan: It was a crucial score that would restore some con- fidence to the team and to the fans. In what was a physical game, C8mpbeU, later in .the period, again pulled through with another . clutch goal following a Geneseo score by netting the rebound of a Pete Cotier shot makjng it 4-2. The nexf:.geal was a thing of beauty. After picking up a loose puck iii. front of the .Oenesseo net Union's Nelson ·Said made an Great goaltending ·by Ron Kinghorn, aggf.essive defense and powerful .offense in the second and ~rd periods were the key to the Dutchmen win. Kinghorn saved 28 shots and showed a lot of character by not folding to a quick 3.o Geneseo lead in the first period. The Skating Dutchrnen are +1 since returning ·from the break, and are ·~ overall. Unionts next game is against Canisius College saturday at Acbill(!s Rink. The Dutchmen .are 4-5 in ECAC diviison Il play and look to Saturdayts matchup against Canisius to push them to the :-soo plateau~ By ELLEN TAPlEY Personal achievement for the individual swimmer is a primary goal which marks Susan Bassett's swinurling philosophy. And as Union's newly appointed Women's Swim Coach, Coach Bassett is looking to instill this premise in all her swimmers, as well as the general public, who tend to look more closely at the win/loss column. Bassett is extremely con- fident in her twenty·member squad, claiming them to be a very well-balanced and dedicated group of women. The team is composed of eighteen swinuners and two divers, a rather high number which is indicative of the growth of such a young ( four year) program. Heading the team as captains are junior Jen Nolan, and sophomore Kathy Kavaney, both returning letterwinners, who participated at States last year. Bassett praiSes . their \excellent leadership skills\ as they continue to prove tbem- selves through· their hard work both in and out of the pool. Backing them up as ex- perienced swimmers are: Jaimie Lipsher, Cindy Curtis, Joy Cybul, Martha Phipps, Lisa Pizzutto, andWendy Sternberg; who when met With such a variety of new talent as seen in Janice Altieri, Elinor Doty, Pam Fiedler, Kate Ide;. Mary Kelly, Ellen Matloff, Nina Smilari, Tara Thomas, Susan Torpie, Aime Simon, Jill Wolkstein, and Elizabeth Wright, have managed to provide Uni()l'l with the solid basis of a pr()gram destined for success. In recent meets the Union Dutchwomen have done ex- tremely well, both individually and as a team. Trouncing Utica (103-63) before the holidays put the team off to a great start, while· .beating .st. Rose last Thursday· nigbt (134-84~ has brought a new senSe of' ac· complishmentt dedication~ and respect to the team. Along with team success, several school records and personal bests were· attained during ~ese meets. Kathy Kavaney broke the 100yd freestyle record with · a time of .59.61, while .laimie Lipsher did the same in the 500yd freestyle. The four women freestyle relay team, comprised of Fiedler, Pizzuto, Lipsher, and Kavaney bettered last year;s record of 4:05;08. Another two records came from senior newcomer Elinor Doty, who captured two records came from senior newcomer Elinor Doty, who captured the lOOyd and 200yd breaststroke events. Yet perhaps more importantly are those who round out the record-holders. Long distance freestyle swimmers are PiZzutto, Lip-. sher. Backstorke superstars are Ide, Sternberg, and Simo11; while Curtis, Doty:, Altieri, and Thomas dominate the breaststroke events. In the butterfly events Kavaney, Torpie, Siililari, and Curtis take over, while Ide, Curtis, Kavaney, and Sternberg dedicate themselves to the I.M. All in all the ac- complishments of the team, both individually and as a unit, make for a successful start of the 1988 season. But as it is in many things, it will only be through the dedicated work of the entire team that will con- tinue to provide the backbone for success. Suppo:rt Union College Athleti·cs . '

The Republican Frontrunners By ALEX GARDNER Democratic Presidential' politics, although it is often heated and interesting, is no where near as exciting and downright dirty as Republican party .politics. The prelude to the primaries for the Republicans has resembled a no-holds barred wrestling match as George Bush and Bob Dole, the two top contenders vie fora shot at the \title\. The two leading Republicans have called a temporary truce to their fight. As primaries heat up, this bitter cock fight is sure to reignite. With ex- perience ana a very popular Republican President as their main advantage over the Democrats, winning this nomination would give them the inside track on the presidency. The President of the United State is the leader of the free world giVing him one of the two most powerful positions in the world today. Repeat after me. Say, ' 1 President Gephart, or President Babbitt, President Simon.\ Now say, \President Bush or President Dole.\ Don't the latter two have a more assuring ring? In a race the perception the public receives through television can be the difference between a frontrunner and a long shot, the Republican candidates have had a singular advantage over ·-their Democratic coooterparts: on television, they look more Presidential. This may have nothing to do with issues, although it may have a lot to de with appearance. No one has compared the Republicans to the Seven Dwarfs or said they looked like a car po{)l. The Republie;ms that look most Presidential are both candidates of elections past. George Bush upset Ronald Reagan in Iowa in 1980 but couldn't keep the momentum going and had to settle on being Reagan's running mate; giving him the obl1o11S lead place among the Republicans' to replace Reagan come 1988~ Bush has on his side; a list of past accomplishments un- paralleled by his rivals as well as by far the strongest political organization throughout the country but seems to be marred by his involvement in the Iran- Col)tra scandal, a whiny weakness and a dubbing as a better second banana than a leader.

The Great Decisions Group kicked off ~heir Tuesday, Jan. 19 seminar on world, national, and local issues with a discussion on U.S. relations with Western Europe. The group was led by Pr()fessqrs Marten and Clinton, as well as Senior David Cope. Although the discussion was generally an open one, the group followed the format provided in Great Decisions '88, a pamphlet from ,wilieh the weekly topics are chosen. The first issue dealt wiih was military relations with our NATO allies, a topic ()f great importance in light of the recent INF Treaty between the superpowers. Views were mix:ed, but most agreed. that the treaty will lead to two basic conclusions: first, that it must be the first of many treaties for it to at all be successful, and second, that it, if passed into law by Congress will severely affect our relations with European allies in the future. The sec(md conclusion was the one which showecl more widespread thought. S()me felt that Europeans are happy with our stand on working t() build a nuclear-free world, while others maintained that they (Europeans) are upset with tt).e U.S. due to the fact that Europe relies on our military might to protect them from Eastern Europe. Along ~litary lines, Great Decisions also took into account other peace solutions, the American standing force in Eur()pe, our own view of NATO, and the opinion of the European common person, as several of the discussion participants had either studied or traveled in Eur'()pe recently. Emnomic and social relations were discussed as well, and again, group opinion varled. One of the more out- spo~en economic thoughts was that Europe should depend on the United States less and unite on common grounds. The E ur~peans were thought to bP at each others' throats too much and as a result all try to fight for American attention. The group was.. mote nationalistic upon economic topics, offering the 'America first' view which was accepted in principle by most people present. The group concluded, that socLally, Europeans hold a paradoxal view of America. They want to loosen the Amllrican influence which is present, but still want to keep the United States around for the benefits. \Europe sounds in many ways like an adolescent chiM in that regard,\ com- mented one person. Great Decisions meets on Tuesday nights at 7:30p.m. in the Milano Lounge above Hale HotJse, and all interested are enc()uraged to attend. No fee exists within the group other than an optional pamphlet ($6) which helps introduce the issue eacll week. UNION COLLEGE STUDENT FORUM AGENDA FOR MEETING #12 JANUARY 28, 1988 1.

The proposal was accepted , with great .heartiness, and the · State of New York was eager to · help. Much literature on the topic of AIDS was given to the committee. The conference is being funded by the Internal .Educati()n Fund and Student Affairs. The conference is special in that each of the speakers are \hands-on\ people, according to Linda Frye. in addition to that, the conunittee is hoping to not only educate from- perspectives .of economics, ethics, society, .and law. \'The idea is to attract st11derits who have inteJests in these areas,\ stated Professor s•yl~s.

This point is reiterated in Morris's cover letter. \More than other years we believe this is a year in which uncertainties abound ... we must have suf- ficient confidence that our plans and aspirations will not be unde-rmined by external cir- · eumstances we can neither foresee nor control. .. this budget therefore makes ... provision .... \.

This is · relatively safe projection · compared to the 4.4% govern- ment estimated increase in C.P .I . .fCons\liiler Price Index) noted Maranville. The·estimated revenues in the proposed budget will primarily come from student tuition and fees~a total of $24,219,8.41, up $2,763 ;9410-assuming that 1940 full time undergraduate students are enrolled at Union. Over tlle past several years, an over-enrollment in the fresh- men class had produced ad- ditional revenues beyond what was estimated in the past proposed budgets. With the new admission requirements, enrollment in the size of the next year's freshmen class are not definite, and a possible over-enrolhnent (or under- enrollment) could be possible altering, the actual tuition revenue. For the 1988-89 un- . dergraduate living in the \most common double room\ and on a · 19-rneal plan, total student • charge£~ will amount to $16,465, up $1,fi64. Last year, Union ranked 32 in student charges on a list of 46 colleges and universities compiled by the College. This year, Maranville _ expects its position to move up. Although the increase in tuition . is a large one, he foresees that there will be colleges that will have larger increases in tuition than Union. Concerning faculty com- pensation, this proposed budget i.s fu.lfilling a second year of a f2 ~ ~ u:: Vice-President for Institutional Planning, Jack Maranville three year program \aimed at positioning Union faculty compensation at the 9oth percentile ranks in the AAUP ratings.\ An increase of 5.0- 5.25% will cover the increase in cost of living; a further .75-1.0% increase will help ''to continue to attract high quali'y faculty members and to keep them.\ Provisions are also being made to meet the needs of the General Ed11cation program which is expected to be implemented next year .upon approval this term. Examples are the ac- commodations for the hiring and redistribution of faculty. The final draft of the 1988-89 fiscal year budget is to be ap- proved at the Trustee's Meeting this spring. RP'I Trustees Name GE Senior Executive New President; Campus in Troy Sees Student Activists Demanding Dive~tment By CHRISTiNE HONG News Editor General Electric senior e:xecuti've Roland W. Schmitt officaUy accepted his n()rnination as the sixteenth president , of Rensselaer PDlytecbnic Institute this weekend at · the Board of Trustees meeting which was held on RPI's campus Satur- day. The Board of Trustees.official announcement·which came the same ·weekend that RPI students held a protest against the WJiversity's investments in South Africa has been en- thusiastically received by both former and new employers. New President Manager Qf Communications for G.E. Research and Development Center Peter VanAvery stated for Con· cordiensis that . \Schmitt has had a distinguished 37 year career in Research and Development at G .E. .At the same time he has \'been a leading, national ·figure in the broad scientific conununity where he has demonstrated interest in higher education. We wish 11im well in llis new career}' The chairman of BPI's board ()f trustees Edward Hood, Jr. coiillilented in the January 25 Scb.eneetady · · Gazette, \Roland Schmitt has demoil- . stfated throughout his career the kind of intellectual leadership that will. help this · excellent wrlversity reach the • high academic and research goals it has set .for itself in the · coming years.\ Acting president Stanley Landgraf, an RPI trustee, will step down from the position . March 1 which will .mark Schmitt's asswnption of the office, Landgraf hal' been S!.lrving as RPI's president since the dismissal of fromer president Daniel Berg last year. Berg was 'ousted' from office due to \several confrontations~' with .both students and trustees alike. Schmitt's past involvement in the scientific community is vast. From 1978 to 1986, ,he served as Vice President (and later Senior Vice President) for Corporate Research and Development. In 1986, he changed offices within G .E .. and assumed the position of Senior . Vice President of Science and Technology for G.E. He chairs · the National Science Board; he · was a me:tneber of the National Academy of Engineering; the · • American Physical Society: the · Institute of Electrical .and , Electronic Engineers; and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Schmitt, a native Texan, is 64 years old. He is a graduate of the University of Texas where he earned degrees in physics and mathematics, and received his doctorate in physics at Rice University. Scbinitt had not declared any specific goals for RIP. His approach to his job as Rip's new president seems unclear as of yet. He's been quoted as saying, \I don't think one should try to be a mastermind.\ His idea for his role in the school. should \go into organization, find out the ideas and dreams -of the people in the organization, add my own, and then stir the pot.\ Student Protest The same weekend as the anno1111cement of RIP's new presMent saw a student protest on the tlniversity's campus. The student demonstrators, which gained local media coverage, marched outside the Board of Trustees meeting which was . being held on the RIP campus Saturday. They were protesting the university's investment of endowment funds in South · Africa. · Matthew Maguire, Director of News Services at RPI gave a statement to Concordiensis stating that \RIP~s Boar(l of Trustees since 1987 has ar- ticulated strongly againSt apartheid. This was reaffirmed Saturday. They only invest in South Africa companies that adhere to the Sullivan Prin- ciples and earn a 1 or 2 rating. (The Sullivan Principles is a set of rules and conditi()ns set up by Leon Sullivan several years ago 'grading' companies operating from a scale of one to seven, one being the 'best' in complying with the conditions and seven, the 'worst.') In response to the student activists, the acting president Landgraf agreed to meet most of the students' demands by providing a list of the companies that are in South Africa that RPI is investing in. In return, .students will provide the Board of Trustees with a list of companies that the college could invest in alternatively. The Board will consider them; however, if the . students' suggestions are not accepted, they will conduct a student- board dialogue to help discuss the matter 'further. The News Services confinns that RIP's board will provide the list to the students within fourteen days. Presently the Union College Board of Trustees is investing college funds in companies that operate in South Africa. ·ADIRONDACK MOUNrAIN-Q.UB ~ SUMMER JOBS .Applications are now available for 1988 summer Jobs In the Adirondack Park.

Win- terfest, on the other hand, is. Now get psyched, because Winterfest is right around the corner, starting Thursday, January 28 and winding down Swday, the 3oth. Four days of nonstop exciting entertainment will fill the Union campus. Those typical winter blues will vanish during all the funfilled activities. Boredom will cease to eKist for fom fantastic days. We shall all forget the subzero temperatures, fierce stinging winds, slick icy walkways and streets, and the colds and viruses, that encompass Schenectady. Many committed students have spent a lot of time and put a great deal of effort into organizing various activities with the hopes of attracting everyone on campus. According to Mrs. Marra, head of student affairs and chief organizer of Winteriest, this year a large number of student organizations including fraternities and sororities, WRUC, tbe concert e>mmittee, to name a few, have. been in- volved in the planning of Winteriest. Mrs. Marra feels that although in the past Win- terfest has not beea terribly successful, this year there will be an event for everyone. Because more clubs and committees are involved ill the actual planning and scheduling of events Winterfest sllould appeal to people of all interests. In the past years there h;ave been conflicts Which have lmred people away from Winterfest events, but this year that sh()uld· not be a problem because tl!ere is someone from almost ev-ery campus organization involved in Winterfest. Mrs. Marra also believes that this year's in- creased advertising and publicity should also attract a larger crowd. The college center will be the main hub of activity dllr\ing Winterfest. There will be bends, dancing, street music, jewelry and clothing vend.ors t)lroughout the four days. All day ice skating, a snow sculpture contest, a cabaret contest ancl free Ben and Jerry's Ice cream are some of the many other activities tb.at Winteriest will offer. Two big events are scheduled f.or SatlJ!day night aad .SUllday, a semiformal at The Ramada from nine to one and a ski tdp to ~t. Snow. Satll:l'day night there will be free hors d' oe11vres served and for. those over twenty-one ther-e willbe all open bar. The popular band Hot Shot will provide the musical en- tertainment for the evening. Your fellow Union stlldents have been working to~ether determined to make this :Year's Winterfest a s11ccess. Come out and take advantage and enjoy the once a year, one of a kind Union celebration. Besides, ~~at else do yo-u have to do, It's Wmter inSchenectady. Are You Aware? By MARYBETIImNNING You've been hearing about this new group on campus, and now you'll have a chance to see os in action. AWARE is a group created to increase awareness fo issues concerning the women .of Union and the effects of these issues . on the entire Union community. Next Wednesday, Feburary 2nd at 8 PM, Val Fahey will be speaking about \Violence in Relationships\ in a program sponsored by AWARE and Fiji. Fahey, who works at SUNY A in career counseling and residence life, developed this program in responce to con- eems of RAs and other college staff who saw students involved in violent relationships. Fahey will not only define dating violence, (whicll can be mental or pllysical), bait will also ex:- plain what can be done. Since people involved in violent relationships don't usually realize it, a program like this can be very beneficial. In ad· dition, Fahey will diseuss acquaintance rape, ancither \silent crime\ that often goes unnoticed in society. On Wednesday, Febru.ary 10th at . 8 PM, AWARE and Sigma Chi will be sponsormg a program entitled \What's.aBoy Toy?\.

According to New York State law, there may be, but the procedure is not as simple. as finding so:meone eb;e's lost property and claiming it as your awn. Statutory law defines lost pr()perty as that which the o~er has involuntarily parted wtth through neglect, carelessness, or inadvertence. Property is ''lost\ when possession nas been casually or involuntarily parted wjth so that the mind has no.knowledge of the parting. In N.Y. State, \l«>st property\ also includes mislaid property, the latter being that which the oWiler has V()luntarily and intentionally placed and then .forgotten. O.K., so you're walking down Union Street one day and you stumble upon a lost piece of pr()perty-let's use a c()cktail ring as an example .. You try the ring on. lt'.s beautifUl and you want to keep it. You figure, I fowd it, it's mine. But is it? Well, yes and no. The finder of lost property acquires a right to that property good against the whole world except (here's the n1> part) the true owner. So, you're tempted to slip the ri.r)g on your finger and to keep it · forever as your own (rationalizing that no one w.ill ever .know). But,'being the good ·law-abiding college studentthat YDU are, you decide to deposit the property with the police department within 10 days. Any person who finds or comes into possession of lost property must d1> tbis and there are penalties for n«;~t depositing the property with the police. · You take a close look at the ring. and decide that the diamonds and rubies really al\en't genuine after all. As a m.atter of fact, .it looks like one of those things that you get iiJ. those macnines at Price Che>pper for fifty cents. ln this case, you're· in luck because wllen lost property is under the value of ten dollars and the finder makes a reasonable effort to find the owner and restore it to him, the fin'der gains title to the property after one ye~r. So you keep the ring, after realizing that it would be pl\etty hard to find the owner in this instance, and decide that your piece wlll adore it. Suppose upon closer in- spection J;J.owever you see that the ring really: isn't a Price Cht>pper freebee, but rather a pl\etty expensive piece (your gemology was never•that go1>d anyway) .. Thinking that it may belong to an enamor~d college sweetheart. such as yoilrself and th~tif someone follnd your ring you would hope that they W1>uld return it to you, you take it down to the Schenectady Police Department. At the police department, you hand over the ring and seeing that ''this-would-look·gl.\eat-on- myawife's-hand\ look in the officer's eyes, you remi11d him that he is required by law to ~ive you a receipt idEntifying the transaction of dElJ)OSit and identifying the property..

However, you may, lleeause if the owner does not claim the property within a specified time period, it is to be deli-vel.\ed to _ the finder, or to a person en- titled to assert the rig!J.ts of the finder (e.g. your mothEr) upon demand · and payment of reasonable expenses. If neither you nor the owner claim the property it is sold a:i public aucti<,m. The time periods of retention by pollee set by law are as follows: For property valuin~ to $99, 3 mos. $100 to $499 6 mos. $500 to $4999, 1 yr. $5000~ 3 yrs. If the property is returned to you after this time, you become the rightful owner of that property. It was all done l~gally and you can now wear the ring in good conscience. Suppose, however,. that you nevermadethetripto.th~ police department, kept tbe 11ing, and wore it.

FEATURES \Those wtlo decide your fate - the Admissions The applications for 1992 . . . How Has the SAT Requirement Affected Them? By SUSAN KANNEL Students might ha:ve the tendency to forget that the College ~pends a lot of time, mo!ley, and energy trying to enttce a group of new and ,in- teresting students to make up next year's freshman Class. The AdJ:nissions office is busy all year long recruiting, in· terviewing, and reviewing the applications of potential Union students. According to Ann Fleming, Associate Dean of Admissions, the nwnber of applications for the class of 1982 has :increased this year. Dean Fleming at- tributes this to the school's er;cellent reputation, and a new positive feeling on the campus which is in part to the com- pletion of the Gym and College center. Another major factor in the surge of applicants, is the elimination of the SAT as a l\equirement for prospective students. Dean Underwood, who was a major operative in the decision to drop the SAT, gave many l\easons .for its removal. One major reason was that the SAT's seem to have a bias against women, who 1UJ illa~~ :ilJlouutatn ~ki 'lttta BAG THE BOOKS ANO HIT THE SLOPES!!!

Dean Underwood referred to Dne school {which he declined to name), that even adds 50 points to women's scores. There is some evidence sugg~sting that minorities also tend to score lower on tbe test. Furthermore, there is some question to the tests' accuracy in indicating a student's potential capabilities. Dean Underwood referred to the fact that if some students' scores can be raised through coaching methDds such as Stanley Kaplan, then the test may sometimes be an unreliable source of information. Instead, he sees achievement test scores, and academic records, as much better indicators of a tudent's ability to handle college level work. At this point, according to Deans Fleming and Under- wood, the major considerations for admissions are the can- didate's academic record, the intel\view (which is now requil.\ed) and achievement scores. The SAT has been \supplemented\ by the option for applicants to iriclude with their applications a piece of \creative\ work; according to Dean Fleming this should ma.ke reviewing applications more interesting and insightful than before. Hopefully, the removal of the SAT requirement will encourage some well qualified students who did badly on the test to apply to Union, and tht:lreby increase the diversity of the applicant pool. When another small liberal arts school, Bates, made the test optional, 70 percent of the applicants still submitted the test. According to Dean Fleming, a good SAT score will still improve an applicant's chance of admission. However, whetller or not a prospective student will feel pressure to include their SAT score regardless of its \optional\ label, for the student may believe that not submitting the score automatically indicates that he or she did poorly. A complete and official ex- planation of the SAT decision is available in a Campus Update Flyer, which can be obtained in the Admissions Office. The Terry Miltner family wants to express their gratitude to each and every one for their kindness in. makirig a tragedy more bearable. May God bless you all.

Accordiag te New York State law, there may be, but the precedure is nd as simple as finding someone else's lost property and claiming it as your own. Statutory law defines lost property as that which the owner has involuntarily ~arted with through neglect, carelessness, or inadvertence. Property is \lost\ when possession has been casually or involuntarily parted with so that the mind has no knowledge of the parting. In N.Y.

Any person who finds or comes into possession of lost property 111ust do this and there are penalties for not depositing the pmperty with the police. You take a close look at the ring and decide that tbe diamonds and rubies really aren't genuine after all. As a matter of fact, it looks lik:e ene of those things that you get in those machines at Price Chopper for fifty cents. !11 this case, you're in luck because when lost property is under the value of ten dollars an<! the finder makes a reaso11able effort to find the owner and restore it to him, the finder gains title to the property after one year. So you keep the r-ing, after realizing that it would be pretty hard to find the oWller in this instance, and decide that your niece will adore it. Suppose upon close!' in- spection .however you see that the ring really isn't a Price Chopper freebee, but rather a pretty expensive piece (your gemology was never that good anyway). Thinking that it may belong to an enamored college sweetheart such as yourself and that if someone found your ring you would hope that they w<>uld retum it to you, you take it down to the Schenectady Police Department. At the police department, you hand over the ring and seeing that \this-would-look-great-on- my-wife's-hand\ look in the officer's eyes, you remind him that he is required by law to give you a receipt identifying the transaction of deposit and identifying the property. He give you one and you leave the station feeling respectable and thinking that you'll probably never hear about the ring again. However, you may, because if the owner does not claim the property within a specified time period, it is to be delivered to the finder, or to a person en- titled to assert the rights of the finder (e.g. your mother) upon demand and payment of reasonable expenses. If neither you nor the owner claim the property it is sold at public auction. The time periods of retention by police set by law are as follows: For property valuing to $99, 3 mos. $100 to $499 6 mos. $500 to $4999, 1 yr. $5000, 3 yrs. If the property is returned to you after this time, you become the rightful owner of that property. It was all done legally and you can now wear the ring in good conscience. Suppose, however, that you never made the trip to the police department, kept the ring, and wore it. You go out one night and encounter a girl at a party who vehemently asserts that you have her ring. According to N.Y. State law, the owner of lost property has the right to reclaim it whenever it may be found and may maintain an action against the finder who refuses to deliver it on demand. In addition, if the finder has used the property in such a way as to injure it, he is liable to the owner for such injury. (By the same token, the finder is en- titled to recover from the owner his necessary expenses in preservation of the property.) Don't take the ring off your finger and give it tG the girl yet, because while property must be delivered to the owner when he (or she in this case) demands it, it is required of him to identify it and establish his ownership, and if he fails to do so, the finder is justified in refusing delivery. One last thing to remember is that if you acquire property which you ·know to have been lost or mislaid, without taking reasonable measures to return such property to the owner, you may face criminal charges, especially if you know who the owner is, and take no action to return it.

By SUSAN KANNEL Students might have the tendency to forget that the College spends a lot of time, money, and energy trying to entice a group of new and in- teresting students to make up next year's freshman class. The Admissions office is busy all year long recruiting, in- terviewing, and reviewing the applications of potential Union students. According to Ann Fleming, Associate Dean of Admissions, the number of applications for the class of 1982 has increased this year. Dean Fleming at- tributes this to the school's excellent reputation, and a new positive feeling on the campus which is in part to the com- pletion of the Gym and College Center. Another major factor in the surge of applicants, is the elimination of the SAT as a requirement for prospective students. Dean Underwood, who was a major operative in the decision to drop the SAT, gave many reasons for its removal. One major reason was that the SAT's seem to have a bias against women, who arr,y · e · nte Speaks at Siena By JENNIFER HOLMES Referring to King, Belafonte declares that \the movement \We shall live in peaee, we toward achieving equal rights shall live in peace, we shall live regardless of race, religion or in peace some day; oh, deep in status was put upon him and be my heart, I do believe, we shall rose for the moment.

Dean Underwood referred to one school (which he declined to name), that even adds 50 points to women's scores. There is some evidence suggesting that minorities also tend to score lower on the test. Furthermore, there is some question to the tests' accuracy in indicating a student's potential capabilities. Dean Underwood referred to the fact that if some students' scores can be raised through coaching methods such as Stanley Kaplan, then the test may sometimes be an unreliable source of information. Instead, he sees achievement test scores, and academic records, as much better indicators of a tudent's ability to handle college level work. At this point, according to Deans Fleming and Un.der- wood, the major considerations for admissions are the <:an- dictate's academic record, the interview (which is 11ow required), and achievement scores. The SAT has been \supplemented\ by the option for applicants to include with their applications a piece of \creative\ work; according to Dean Fleming this should make reviewing applications more interesting and insightful than before. Hopefully, the removal of the SAT requirement will encourage some well qualified students who did badly on the test to apply to Union, and thereby increase the diversity of the applicant pool. When another small liberal arts school, Bates, made the test optional, 70 percent of the applicants still submitted the test. According to Dean Fleming, a good SAT score will still improve an applicant's chance of admission. However, whether or not a prospective student will feel pressure to include their SAT score regardless of its \opthmal\ label, for the student may believe that not submitting the score automatically indicates that he or she did poorly. A complete and official ex- planation of the SAT decisi()n is available in a Campus Update Flyer, which can be obtaine<l in the Admissions Office. The Terry Miltner family wants to express their gratitude to each and every one for their kindness in making a tragedy more bearable. May God bless you all.

She went on to :tell rne that her door is open to any student who . would like to talk with her about food services. Appointments By ANDREWHERSHAFT AND BU..L ROBBINS Jack's Oyster House In Septembel\' 1984, we arrived at Union College, unaware that we would spend the next four years searching for good food and rarely finding it. To those of you who love eating as much as we do, we offer this column. Jack's Oyster House, an Albany favorite, seemed as good a place as any to begin. We arrived Saturday at a :30, fifteen minutes late, and were promptly seated. The restaurant is a large high- ceilinged room, decorated with _ pictures of old Albany. The atmosphere is somewhat old and businesslike, with many tables crowded together. Jack's is great for rubbing elbows with local bigwigs, but not a place for a quiet, romantic dinner. Our water glasses were quickly filled, and we were served a basket of assorted breads and rolls. Jack's menu consists primarily of beef and seafood dishes, and there is a fairly extensive win_e list. For an appetizer, Hersh chose the shrimp cocktail, which he en- joyed, although he felt he had had better. The four large shrimp were served with a delicious cocktail sauce and a plate of horseradish and crackers. I ordered the clams genovese, which consisted of about a dozen clams, cooked with herbs and marinctra sauce, served on a hot skillet. Clams have never been my favorite, but this was an excellent dish. Almost immediately after we finished our appetizers, our salads were served. Unlike the small ornamental salads served in many expensive restaurants, Jack's. was basic and sub- stantial, consisting of lettuce, tomato, cucumber and mushroom. The salad, fresh and properly chilled, was topped -with our choice of a delicious, somewhat sweet, roquefort dressing. Once again, we had little chance to relax in between courses, as our entrees were quickly served. Hersh had the sirloin steak, topped with mushrooms and served with broccoli spears and a baked potato. The steak, \cooked to perfection,\ was good sized, extremely tender and tasty. The potato was good, and the mushrooms were the perfect compliment to the steak. My choice of broiled lobster tails was served with broccoli spears and a delicious stuffed potato. A nice touch was the burnet which kept the melted hutter for the lobster warm. The lobster was almost chewy, but fWl of ~vor and nothing short of delectable. I did not sample the brDCcoU, but He~ felt -~ was only average. By this point we were both quiet full, which speaks well for the size of Jack's portions. Skipping over a variety of tempting desserts, including homemade cheesecake, Hersh ordered raspberry sherbert and I had fresh strawberries with whipped · cream. · Although Jack's offers several coffees, Hersh had the regular type and I had tea. The sherbert was standard, according to Hersh, while I thought the strawberries were very gDod, especially in light -of the season. The fresh whipped cream was out- standing. On the wholE, tbe service was excellent, although maybe too ·rushed for some. We both agreed that our waiter was very professional, if not quite as friendly as the other waiters. The customer is well cared for· at Jack's - you will rarely find your water glass empty. Based on our 1-10 point rating system, relative to other restaurants ill the area of comparable price, I gave Jack's an 816, while Hersh rated itan8.

Immediatly, we realized we were the youngest p~ople in the restam~ant, (except for the little girl wh() was playing by the 'in' and 'out' doors and .got hit in the head just like we · thought she would). Therefore, we were given a prime table, - right in view()( the kitchen, (so we could see the little girl get hit). The bread and butter was waiting for us. the rolls were nothing to write home about, and the butter was just like the kind at Blue Ribbon Diner, but we were hungry and who cared? Our Garco11 for the .evening was v~ry nice. He was only ,condescending when he asked us if we wanted \soft drinks\ with our 1 Iilea1! Indeed! But, we took no offense and were v·ery pleased with tile effeciency that he refilled our water glasses and his gener~l personality. For appetizers we indulged in · Clams CaSin(), and Escargot. The order of clams was large, and we were S()mehow unallle to finish it all. Tiley were tasty as were the escargot, (served in the shell). Poor Tina was unable to have either of her first choice din- ners, for the lobster was not prepared. Oh alas, she ordered the seafood platter, MVP had prime rib, and I bad 1be shrimp salad. We found serviee prompt too, but it needn't be, .. for in this restaurant we thought looked just like a New Y' or~ Deli, (like Wolf'slthink), tllere was ample time to gossip ill between courses. Although tile tables were a tad to close for comfort, we did not know anyone at the restaurant nor did 1lley know us, so there was IIO need to lower our audible voi<les. When our entrees arrived, we were impressed with the amount of food on tile plates. Obviously, that new and ridiculous trend in the city,. of charging. an arm -a!ld a leg for three peas and a bi11t of th~ entree bas not yet 11it Albany. We were all genErally im- pressed with the fQod. MVP's rib was pink and juicy., Tina left only two scallops, aJJd I ate all my shrimp and tile bed or lettuce~ I did however,.leave the dollop of coleslaw ~nd gnarly poq:ato salad for tbe kitchen staffto deal with. The dessert mentt was an unecessary way tCJ end our -meal, but we were bulire ne~d of calories. So, MVP ordered a t.:!heese cake with strawberries, and Tilla orderedicecream and apple pie. I got cofl ~e. Then, I ate m()St of Tina's -dish, but because it came from. her plate it had no calories. It was very delicious. We found Jack's a jlreat place are not necessary for students, although she would }ltefer one be made. Many wonder who decides what we are going to .J)e served. Well, Ms. Gray \would like to think we do.\ In order to represent the students there is a menu committee. rt -is com- posed of student represen- tatives from each class,. in- cluding at least two vegetarians. They work with Richard Baia, the Assistant Director -of Dining Services. The first meeting is set,. ten .. tively, for Februacy 3, 1988. The meals are chosen from a variety of recipes: WhenJ went to the meeting, I bro11:ght a list .of compl~ints and slig~estions. These lists were C()lllJiiled by surveyillg students In my dorm. Ms. Gray and I re21d thtough.them together. SitE .agreed there u·e many ne.cessary changes that need to be Inade. Ms. Gray then told me shE 'Will try to make as .many of tbese (!hanges as possible~ Contrary to belief, the meat, .pol!ltl\'y and fish are of high qila~ty.

CONCO.RDlBNSIS, Januar1 28, 1988 Pag~ 11. -INTERNATIONAL FEATURES Political Parties in West Germany By SUSANNE LEMMJ1R In any democracy political parties are among the most important political institutions. The Federal Republic's ,Basic Law defines their task as participating \in the forming of the political will of the people;\ The Parties- There are at the present time five parties in the Bundestag, the House of Representatives , in Bonn, the Social DemQcratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Christian Democratic Union ,of Germany ( CDU}, the Christian Social Union ( CSU} in Bavaria, the Free Democratic Party {FOP); and the Greens (Die Grtmen}. The CDU has no membership in Bavaria, leaving the field there to its sister party, the CSl.J, which in .tlli11 operates only in Bavaria .. · At the national level, in the BWidestag, the two sister parties formed one joint parliamentary CDU-CSU block. The four parties were formed between 1045 to 1947. The SPD was a recreation of the former labor-oriented party which Hitler's regime outlawed in 1933. The other parties saw themselves as new formations, building only in part on the traditions of the Weimar Republic between the two world wars. In contrast to the. Catholic Central Party (Zen- trwnspartei) of the Weimar period the CDU and CSU sought their electoral support among both of Germany's tnajQr creeds, Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The FDP laid claim to the heritage of German liberaliSm which was share4 by quite a few parties before 1933. In the more .than three decades since tlteir establish• ..ment, all the parties have Un· dergone .signlfi.:ant changes~ These days, all perceive , themselves as :popular parties representing avl classes of people. The SPD, CDU; and FDP all have very distinct riglg and left Wings. This is ,!lot only due to their histories b1lt alSo becallSe in a modern ;parliamentary democracy with ()nly a few big parties an views and positions seek to integrate into these ''popular'' groupings. CDE·CSU-Tlle Christian Democratic Union, together with its sist,er party, the Christian Social Union,_ shaped the formulative years of the Federal Republic of Germany, especially l;lnder the chan- cellorship ·of Ko11rad Adenauer. Under their .leadership the conce,pt of a • 'social market economy\ was !leveloped and realized. It was the CDU-CSU Party that laid :the foWldations .for the integl'ation of the Federal Republic with the West, pushing for a JJtrong Atlantic Alliance EuropEan integration and reconciliatil()n with Srance. These elements are still the main pillars of its political· orientation. Tlle Christian Democrats ff!v()r a strong state to protect tlte rights and liberties of tbe individual. Another objective is to reach normal relation.s with the East through a policy(){ dialogue and strength. This Week ·in the World HAITI·- In the recent presidential elections, it ~ppears that · Leslie Manigat is the winner, with just over SO% of the vote. Although the election was a free one, ballot stuffing was used in addition to examination of the ball<>t. PANAMA - General Manuel Antonio Noriega has begun to feel more foreign pressure. A U.S. backed -plan to have him leave his position in place of a civilian government . was rejected. Also, La Preosa, a newspaper, has been given pennission by the government to resume production .. ISRAEL - The Israelis have switched to a ne-w tactic in breaking up protesting masses. The police have tried more violent methods but have decided to drop their guns in place of truncheons. AFGHANISTAN - The Soviets have antl()unced that they plan to withdraw their 115,000 troops !;tationed in Afghanistan. it is believed that the men will be home by the end ofthis year. 'l'lle Catholic social bourgeois- li!JeJ\al (leftist) and rural COI!S.ervative tradition attracts e ,sp e c i a 11 y m t d dl e clilss professionals, managerial staff and civil servants. ISPD-The Social Democratic Fatty is the oldest party in the Federal Republic of Germany. F()mded in the 1860's as a party of tlle working class with some Mlll\xist orientation, it was b!U!Ded during the Third Reich. The SPD is proud of its. !,OOts in the workerS' moveiileijfAAd did n~1 formally give up its ~axxist doctrine Wlti11959. Until then, it wa.s strongly opposed to the concept of the \social mark~ economy\ and favored instead Fe<leral Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU) . the nationalization of the key indu.stries. It reluctantly agreed to western integration, esl)ecially on the military level, mainly for national reasons, fearing that this policy might deepen the division of Ger- me~ny. By the late 1960's, hliWEver, it had accepted the changed situation and when the fil\st Social Democratic ch.ancellor, Willy Brandt, took office . in 1969, the Bonn gQ;vernment (an SPD-FDP coe~lition) formally recognized the existence of a second state in Germany, the GDR. The SPD tried to complement the western orientation by a policy of reconciliation and ac- co:nunodation with the East, best known as the \Neue Ost- .p()litik.\ It developed concepts lilc:e the \Eur<>peanization of S&(!Wity\ policy, or \Security pllrtnership with the East.\ The S11cial Democrats favor a strGng role of the government in tlle economic process and stTacture society along e~aiitarian principles. This set into motion a policy which eldended the network of Social Security and strove for more equal opportunities in education. The SPD is at- tr~l!tive to workers as well as to :yomger and more proro-essive · aca-demics and is in general strong among the urban pcptilation. rnP-The Social-Liperal era GERMAN CLUB PRESENTS.· Monday~ Feb. 1 W.llO STRAWBERRIES ltl COLLEGE CENTER By CHRIS HAIRTMANN .. ~-. ~·: ·~.

Please refer to Chris' letter on page 13. came to an end in 1982 when. Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, losing support by parts of his own party, had to .step down because the Free Democrats left the coalition they had fonned with the SPD. Judged by the participation of the government, the FDP must be considered the most succesSful party .in the F.R.G. Rarely gaining more than ten percent of the votes, it has managed tG take part in almost every government fonned in Bonn; Today the Free Democrats present themselves in. a somewhat more conservative manner than before, criticizing the ·~social market economy,\ from a liberal point of view. They speak out as protectors ()f individual rights 81\d for legal rights of minorities and th~y demand equal ¢pportunities f<>l\ all. Although originally coming from a nationalist corner, tbe FDP was the first to give up the traditional reunification policy. It joined the SPD in providing detente policy with the East and although it split with the SPD, because of divergencies in national security policy and for economic differenc.es, it regards itself as the true fighter for a policy of relaxation with the East. The higher educated self-employed as well as far- mers used to form the backbone of the electorate of the FOP. These days the higher l.n~ come managerial civil servants and independent owners of medium-sized firms are at- tracted by this party. Tile constituency of the Free Democrats is made up of ve1y different groups. On a federa1 level, it depends heavily on those CDU-CSU voters who tend to split their votes (which the German electoral system of two votes allows) in favor of t:lle FDP to confirm or bring into power a coalition goverrunent of two parties. The Greens-In 1983 tbe Greens (die Grunen) won seats in the Bundestag for the first time, after they had been in six state parliaments previously. The Greens developed int() a political party out of a radical environmental protection movement Wliting opponents ll.f nuclear power and other protEst groups and representing pacifist tendencies. The Green~ have had a federal organization since 1979 and find most of their support in the younger generation. They draw their ~upport from protest voters, unemployed academics and students but also from higher educated middle-class income groups, many of whom hav-e university degrees and are quite often civil service em· ployees. The philosophical and the<>retical program .of the Greens is still intensely debate<! within the party itself. The so· called \Fundamentalists' ,, question some basic principles of democracy (majority rille;. state monopoly of force), and are not willing to assume political responsibility in a government, The .\Realists\ ()U the other band, want t<> change the system by playing by itsrllle~, and are ready to enter coalitions. Nevertheless, the Green's political profile shows: some distinctive chara(!- teristics. They- see themselves a:s an ecological and peace ID()vement. Tiley are for better protection of the environment 1111d basically are against n;uclear energy, even lit the price of high economic costs. They favor a neutral disar;med F'ederal 'ltepublic of Gennany, dlsregarding ,political risks. The overwhehning maj()rity of the Green leadership has its roots in the student protest generation of the 1960's, if not personally S(), at least ideologically, .c()mbining their versions of Marxism with environmental - demands and preindu~trial, economic ideas. The emergence o:fthe Greens has brougll.t some eb~ges in the political land· scape. For mol\e than 20 years there had been practically a tllree-party system in the Bundestag (wherethe CDU and CSU have always fol'IlUld one group) and each -of the parties has been the coalition partner of tlle other two on one or more ·occasions. The Greens are now a fourth grouping in the house. [nitially, none of the other three parties would coalesce with it . The first coalition with the Greens was established by the SPD at state level in Hesse in 1985. It remains to be seen whether the Greens cari .play a Lasting role in the Federal Republic's politics. It is certain that they have changed the balance of power and led to a new configuration of the party system. The Future of the Party System-Today the Federal Republic has a two party block system. On the one side there are tbe Christian Democrats and the Free Democratic Party, which formed a governing coalition with only a f()ur-year interruption from 1949 to 1966, and have done so again from 1982 under CDU Chancellor Helmut Kohl. On the left, there are the Social Democrats and the Greens who do not know WJhether or not they should form a coalition on the Federal level. The fact is that neither of the two major parties seem to be strong enough to win the 11ecessary majority to enable it to form .a g()vemment of its IDWD. Within each party block, however, the parties draw, to a certain degree, from the same reservoir of votes. Gains for the Greens are losses for the SPD, and gains f<>r the ·cou are losses for the FDP and vice versa. That makes it very clifficult for the Free Democrats to define their role and profile. \l'oday the party that tips the :scales is the Greens. Con- ! :sequently, with the SPD there · exists a strong CW'rent that . llopesto reach a majority left of the center by devel()ping an agenda that might also be at- 'tractive to Green voters. Recent ·developments, however, in- dicate that the party might fail in its eff<>rts. t() straddle both sides of the fence. Election victories are now decided by the ability of those parties to mobiliZe the fl()ating voters in the center of the political spectrwn. Despite the fact that more and more voters are moving between the two blocs, shifts of power have seldom occurred in the Federal Republic of Germany and are likely to do so in the future.

Some of the largest increases in expenditures .are in areas that our editorials have also called for greater expenditures. But we should question why a tuition increase that both Vice President Hauser and Vice President Maranville admit is well above the increase of most of rival colleges is the way of paying for it. One large part of the increase, $570,000, goes to improving faculty salarie~.. Of that, $260,000 is standard cost-of-living. The other $210,000, Maranville said, will concentrate on improving the salaries of full professors. Last year, a increase of $175,000 brought our associate professors up from 15th to lOth place, from an average salary of $42,500 to $46,300. The list consists of 32 \comparable\ colleges; at tile top of the list is RPI at $49,700, with schools like Wellesley, Lehigh, Colgate, Lafayette and Franklin and Marshall above; Amherst is in a tie and places like Williams, Wesleyan, Middlebury, and Hamilton below. Our full professors now place 23rd, at $58,700. Wesleyan is at the top, with the schools listed above and moTe, like St. Lawrence and Vassar, all outdistancing our full professors' salaries. Maranville claims that the $210,000 increase will boost their level into the top half, comparable to Bowdoin and Bucknell. We believe that if Union is to remain a strong academic school, we have to be willing to pay faculty well -- to attract new professors and retain current professors. Money isn't the only attraction Union has for a teacher, but it is often a detennining factor, and competitve salaries are necessary. Financial aid is also seeing a large increase. Few of us would ask the College to neglect that area. The increase of $551,000 to a total of $5,192,017 represents an 11.9% increase over this current year's budget. The budget statement claims that the 11.9% increase, 1.4% over the tuition increase, will \keep us competitive.~· That, we believe, may need more consideration. Last year, srudent aid went up $388,000. The other major increase is $520,000, $250,000 of which represents the standard 6% increase from last year. The other $270,000, Maranville said, goes toward increased cost of \employee· health and life insurance, annuities, and remission of tuition programs,\ as the preliminary budget says. That may be necessary, but at present we are -unsure if that was the least expensive way possible of insuring Union employees. Finally the big question. Why a tuition increase ~o cover all this? Maranville and Hauser reiterated that the tuition increase is the last element figured into the budget process, to fill in what other sources can't meet. It is not, they said, the first resource figured in. But for now, we're still not convinced that all means were exhausted before the 10.5% hike.

The Policy finally gives the Space Station real significanee by .using it as a low orbit transfer point to both the tn:Qon and Mars, and it reaffirms the U.S.'s determination to regain the number one positL()n in .manned space flight. Not to ignore \1 Reagan also proposes a joint us.;;,soviet Martian sample return Illi:ssion in the 1990's, along witb. many other possible joint proj~cts he will discuss with Gorbachev in their upcoming Sl![llfller summit. For their part, the Soviets have· proposed several joint explorational projects at recent international space conferences, but I'm afraid Ron doesn't have space exploration in mind a~ his first priority. For example, I think he win veto a joint manned Mars mission, preferring to reserve manned planetary exploration as an exclusively American en- deavor. The polic:,r also resolves some other controversial questions about the Space Station (not the least of which was wllether it Space Capsule By MARTIN HECK In the middle 1990's, NASA plans to orbit a large permanent space station. The station would acconunodate a crew of up to eight astronauts involved in hundreds of l'esearch activities such as studying the universe through powerful telescopes, processing materials for use on earth, and experimental research in biology and other fields. The station will operate 24 hours a·day, for, hopefully, a period of thirty years. The entire time the station is in orbit, compllters will be rwming and boosters will be firing to maintain the station's proper position abo\Ve the earth. These activities require a great amoUilt of energy. It is estimated that . this station will require at least 15 _times more power than· the United ·States has ever needed for a space project. The required elec- tricity would be seven times the amount -the Soviet Union's permanent orbiting unit uses. Generating this much power presents a difficult problem to engineers designing the station. At this point, engineers plan that in the first stage of the orbital craft, power will be created by photovoltaic cells. Sunlight will hit large panels, made up of these silicon photovoltaic cells, and light will be transfonned into electricity. Some of the electricity will be consumed immediately, the rest will be stored in batteries for the time the station will not be in tbe sunlight. The station will spend one third of its time on the dark side of the earth, without sunlight. When the electricity stored .in the bat- teries is utilized, it must be converted te> alternating current. Altemating current is safer, ac<:ording to the engineers, and produces less electromagnetic interference. The power produced by the photovoltaic. panels will be sufficient for the station through the late 1990's, the space station's \first stage.\ Late in the 1900's, however, beca11se of expansion, the station will demand more power. At this stage a generator will have to be employed in order to create enoilgh elec- tricity. This procedure would entail the focusing of sunlight by a large mirror onto a receiver filled with a salt-like material and a xenon-helium gas mixture. The gases will become heated and spin a turbine, generating electricity. The gases will then l:Je cooled and recirculated. 'The salt provides heat to warm the gases while the station is 011 the dark side of the earth. The 11rocess is called solar dynamic, and has been tested on earth, but not in space. Power requirements for the space station represent only a beginning in the technology of producing electrical power in space. Some plans for the future envision hUge photovoltaic panels, many miles across, collecting energy and beaming it to earth via rnicrowave beams to power cities across , America. While this technology is still a good distance in the future, solar dynamic illustrates the impDrtance space may hold for the generation of power in the future.

The free perfonnance will feature Jim and Lauren · Cowdery, Jan Elliott, and Nancy Crutcher. Jim and Lauren Cowdery will present traditional Irish music and dance. Both performers play pennywhistle, as well as other instruments. Jim Cowdery ,:who earned a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University in 1985, is an eminent scholar in Irish music. He learned Irish sean- nos (\old style\) singing .from one of the great masters, Joe Heaney of County-Galway. His wife, Lauren, is a specialist in Irish step dance. She has been studying traditional Irish step dancing since 1983; at the May Duffy Academy and will be teaching Celtic dance in the fall at Wesleyan University. Jan Elliot will be performing an ancient English folk dance style known as \Morris.\ Morris dance is pre-Christian. According . to Union college Assistant Professor of Music Tom Ross. who is supervising the improvisation. series, Morris dance probably dates back to the Druids. Nanc:y Crutcher is a Master of the Great Highland bagpipe. She will probably be giving a solo performance tomorrow night. The next Winter Im- provisation concert, focusing on American Jazz, will be held on February 12. The performance will feature Tom Ross on guitar and mbira (thumb piano), joined: by Jane Ira Bloom on saxophones and Jeff Fuller on bass.

At this concert, Nick Brign(lla, one of the preinier sax()phonists in contemporary music, will be the guest soloist with the orchestra. Several students have expressed sur- prise to the combination of a ja~z personality with a sym- phonic ensemble but it tells the capital .Reglon - families, students and an - that the Schenectady Symphony is aiming to broaden the musical horizons of the people.

MORGAN House of Freaks - Monkey oa a Chain Gang Bryan Harvey and J ohlmy- Hott are the sole residents in Virginia's House of Freaks, wllo have just released their debut album - Monkey on a Chain Gang - on Rhino Records. The album is solid, but it raises more than a couple of question$. There is a. smattering of musical influences, leaving the listener wondering what artist each song brings to mind. Additionally, what could a monkey possibly do to be sentenced to a chain gang? The album is pleasing as a whole and stands up to repeated listenings, though there ave· several obvi!Jus throw-aways. Harvey's guitar sears like cheap Mexican grub throughQut each song, and Hott lays down an envigorating heat as the one man rhythm section.Small groups often over .. produce their records to cover Up for the lack of complexity in their work, but production is tastefully restrained on Chaia Gang. The first single, \Bottom of the Ocean,\ has been featured on several compilation sam~ piers,. rocks hard and clearly brings Guadal Canal Diary to mind. \Black Cat Bone\ and \Yellow Dog\ stand out as two upbeat and different tunes. To their credit, House of Freaks have introduced this cub record reviewer to a new musical genre: the balad that the listener wants to crank. \Lonesome Graveyard\ is 'WRUC THE NEW 8.97 ·mellow and slow, yet its sub- tlety is comparable to a Mike Ty~()n tight upside the head. Strangely, my favorite song b:y this duo is on the B side of \:S.ottom of. the Ocean,\ \I'll Treat You Right Someday\ jll!llps off the turntable, in addition to making compact disc players hop with glee.
