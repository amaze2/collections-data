The brain~ of the college are there, \ no doubt, but the hands are in N e\V York : dpally derived. 1\'he property fro.m its near- ness to New York, is rapidly appreciating in value, and the n1ore enthusiastic of the trus- tees speak of the con1ing day \~·hen Union \vill be the n1ost magnificently endowed col ... lege in the country. ' city and the feet are firmly planted on the : soil of l .. ong Island r(ity, whence, like .i\11tceus · of old, Union College derives ~its real strength and chief support. In these latter days it takes n1oner, and a . great deal of rnoney, to run a college and run it successfully. Every institution of learning in the East is an eleen1osynary institution and Union probably tnore liberally than any other college, in proportion to its endowment and attendance, provides for the ed nca tion of students unable to pay the fees of tuition.

There is no appointment of a cabinet officer that will be more popular or more sure of public applause than that of Daniel S. Lamont to the war portfolio. If he knows anything about war or soldiers, he has been so far very successful in concealing his knowl- edge from an inquisitive public; but the same smart intelligence and practical sagacity that made him a model private secretary to President Cleveland, an extremely successful railroad director, and the most Ronght-after president of banking and other business corporations in New York, will not be long in putting the versatile New Yorker au j a it of his duties as \var large business e~1terprises and has displayed extra- ordinary executive ability and achieved remarkable 1 success. He is a man of keen penetration, o£ fertile ' Tesources, of never failing tact, and of phenotnetial capacity for work. His selection to a cabinet position is an excellent one in every way and will not, we think, be seriously criticised in any quarter.-IndiaJl- apolz:'> Sentinel. J. SterHng Morton,. '56.

Morton is in every way admirably fitted for the position to which he has been chosen. He is a good business man and a thorough Democrat. He was born in Adams, Jefferson county, and when we were boys we went to school together. He moved out of the State a number of years ago, about twenty-five, I think, and went to Nebraska. Since then he has been very successful in business and is one of the most prominent men in the State. His views on the tariff and finance are sound, and he \vill make a good cabinet offi.cer.-Governor Florzver. ---~--- ~ -· --·· --· ---- ---- ---- -- - --~ ------ secretary.-1\ 7 c'W Orleans 'Iz'mes-D-e11zocrat. 1 Col.

Alexander. rrhe eio hth of the J)utterfield course of b lectures was delivered in the college chapel I~~riday afternoon l\Iarch 3d. General Horace Porter, of N e\v \T ork city, \vas the lecturer and he \vas introduced by that loyal son of \Old Union,'' Robert C. Alexander, '8o. In a bright and witty speech JV.Ir. Aiexander in- troduced the lecturer telling of the General's prcseuce in 1\.ew York at the al u n1 ni banquet in Decen1bcr and his interpretation of c;eneral Butterfield's Latin bill of fare. No better tnan to introduce the di:.;tingnisheJ lecturer could have been selected and none n1ore ac- ceptable to the students, as R.obert C. Alex- ander is probably the n1ost popular of Union's younger alun1ni atnong the undergraduates. General Porter took for his subject \ ·rhe Surrender of I-'ee at 1\ppon1attox.\ l-Ie had intended to speak on the \Vest Point l\'Iilitary Acaden1y, but the ground had been so thor- oughly covered by the previous lecture of General l\1ichie, that another subject \vas deetned n1orc suitable. The lecturer began by cotnplin1enting· the college and General Butterfield on so interesting and instructive a course of lect urcs as was indicated by the list. General Porter described in a vivid and interesting n1anner all the details of the can1~ paign during the n1onths of March and April, 1865, which led to the final scene at Appo- n1attox, illustrating his narrative by a black- board n1ap of the scene of operations. l-Ie had been on General c;rant's staff during all that tin1e and was present \vhcn the tern1s of surrender \vere arranged by Grant and I.,ec and having taken full notes at the tin1c was peculiarly fitted to narrate those interesting incidents. The trials of the troops in the \/irginia n1ud during that spring were such that they could answer, when asked if they had been through Virginia 1 \\'{ es, in a grea,t nun1ber of places.\

A PHOTOGRAPHlL GENIUS. Union, '48. After two years of litigation a very important pat- ent case has lately been decided in favor of the Rev. Ifannibal Good win, a retired Episcopal clergy- man, \vho lives in N e'vark. His clain1 ,,,.as nothing , less than the broad o1ie that he \\Yas the originator and earliest applicant for a patent upon the transparent · and fiexib1e celluloid films used in kodaks and other cameras which are fitted with rolls and roll holders. 1-!is was the basis upon which the Eastman Company's 1nost valuable devices rested. It was not an accidental disc')vt:ry, bnt a deduction, and he talked of it to a n1an v:ho broke faith witli him and endeavored to t.rtake capital of the invention. This faet ·was brought out in the trial of the cas~ at \Vashington. :\1 r. Good \\·in still preaches occasion- ally, and ·whenever he fills the pulpit of any chnrch in or near Nc,vark he has a large audience. He is a large-frmned n1an, considerably over 6 feet tall, anc1 has a pleasing voice, remarkable power of thought, and a fluent delivery. All \\-ho kno\Y him are pleased with his g-ood fortune. l\fr. Goodwill applied for a broad patent son1e years .ago upon a broad clain1 for the product and the pro- cess of n1anufacturing it. Shortly aftenvard tile Eastman Company filed an application for .a patent for one of its employees. 1\1r. I-I. 11. Reichenbuch and the examiners decided that the hyo applicants were in interference. Then cmne a long fight, in which some of the most noted patent attorneys and other lawyers ·w·ere engaged. The case \vas brongh t to a successful issue for :Mr. Good,vin, lately. Recently the Eastman Con1pany sent agents to 1Jr · Gooch,.dn to endeavor to effect a compromise, but their terms \Yere not satisfactory. The company had spent a quarter of a 1nillion dollars in a plant for the manufacture of the filn1s, and was reluctant to give up. A stubborn fight was 1nade for it. All sorts of appeals 'yere n1ade, and even the patentability of the product \YaS assailed, but the decisions ,,~ere all in favor of the Ne,vark clergy1nan, and so complete are they that it is doubtful if the Eastman Con1pany will atte1npt to carry the case any further. If the company secures :Nlr. Goodwin's interest, its position will be rendered unassailable by the strength of the decisions in his favor. :Mr. Goodwin can clain1 no money for goods already manufactured by the East- tnan Cmnpany, it is said, but fron1 the date of grant- ing of the patent they ha\'\e no further right to n1ake the fihns. Hannibal Goodwin, ·who is about 70 years old was graduated from Union College in 1848. He went to Ne,vark in 1854, and ·was in charge of St. Paul's Episcopal Church until 1858, when he left to go to California. He returned to Newark in 1867, and was pastor of the House of Prayer until six years ago, \vhen his health broke down and he retired fron1 active work in the church. Before giving up his charge he beca1ne deeply interested in photography and struck out in lines which had scarcely been en- tered upon by others. He was especially interested in reproductive processes, and 1nade some valuable discoveries in zinc work, -yvhich have been seized upon for the purpose of newspaper ill ustrat:ion. ;!)

The noted lawyer and author, Douglass Campbell, formerly of New York, but who resided of late years in Schenectady, died at his home J\Iarch 7th. lie had been an invalid for a number of years, spinal disease being the cause of death. :Mr. Campbell \vas a son of Judge \V. \Y. Cmnpbe11, of Cherry Valley, N.Y., noted as a statesman and la\vyer. Douglass Campbell graduated from Fnion in 186o, taking the second Blatchford prize. He wa~ 1 a 1nember of the Sigma Phi fraternity, to which hi~ father also belonged. Soon after graduation he be- , came a major of United States ,·oluntcers in the ci\·il war. He graduated from Harvard law school in 1 36:; and entered upon the practice of la\Y in 1\ ew York city. He was for some ti1ne associated with Judge Hilton; afterwards he becan1e a member of the firm of Can1pbe1l & Bell until it was dissolved, This firm was succeeded by that of Campbell & Paige. l.lr. Campbell attained a high standing at t11e bar for legal acquiren1ents. He had a number of important snits, among then1 acting as counsel in the famous Jnme1 will case. I-Hs practice proved large a.nd lucrative. About five years ago he was obliged to abandon the practice of the law o\ving to in1paired health. For the past three years he has resided in Schenectady. 1'lr. Campbell achieved a reputation in the literary world by his work, '' The Puritan in F:Iollanc1, Eng- land and An1crica.\ Fi\-e editions ha,·c been issued and the book has been praised by the best critics of Europe and Atnerica.

Rochester should begin yery soon or she will not be able to get as high a place in the league this year as she did last. Fnion is n1aking- strenuous efforts to secure :first place now that she has been re-admitted into the league, and she has already secured the sen·ices of professionals as trainers, and is n1aking her men undergo a course of training in the gymnasiun1.-h..,oc:ht'sltr Campus. \Ye arc g1ac1 to sec that C nion has again entered the base ball league. Her entrance rneans more than the simple iact that there will be another college to contend with on the field; it 1neans that the league of the small colleges of this state has become such a power that to stay out of it, is practically to adn1it an inability to contend with the colleges which are so banded together. If the tnem bers of the league arc true to their colors the end of this ball season will find the colleges more dosely honncl together by the ties of friendly competition than ever before. By being 4 4 true to their colors\ we mean that they will enter the league contests with the intention of treat- ing the other 111em ben; of the league as they wish to be treated; to see that fair and intelligent un1pircs arc chosen ; to decide t l1at i here will be no encleayors to cancel engagements or cheat the other · teams out of the n1oncys due them, through son1e little finessing, which may keep a few dollars in one's pockets but which will surely lov;·er the ones so acting- in the eyes of all respectable and equity-loving men. The prospects are excellent for an exciting season, with a chance of seeing some fine hall playing. The
