Garis, Dean of the College, formally retired from active service this past Friday, Janu;ry 31. His successor, Dr. C. William Huntley, '34, forrr.erly Dean of Adelbeit Col- lege of Western Reserve University, began control of the office the fol- lowing day, Garis Saga Dr. Garis, born in Easton, Penn- sylvania in 1881, began what was to be a varied and brilliant life at Union College when he was appoint- ed to the faculty as Instructor in the Mathematics- Department in 1903. Valedictorian of his class at Lafayette College, he continued to demonstrate his ability as a teacher and was quickly elevated to full professorship in 1908, Dean of Men in 1919, and finally to Dean of the . College in 1934. During this time, Dr. Garis made many valua.ble contributions to the development of the College and to the welfare of the students under his supervision. Exhibiting a nat- ural flair for executive pLnning, he reorganized the entire class and ex- amination schedules in 1904, and tince then has been chairman of every important committee or board 1t Union. Meanwhile, he continued to pursue his first love, teaching the students of the college.

Garis' administrative accorr plish- ments are his reorganization of the Athletic Department, organization of the college divisi.on curricula, and hie efforts in expanding student ac- tivities. Likewise, The Employment Bureau owes its existence to his forethought and sincere interest in the students' post-college careers.

THE ICE AGE-AGAIN OR STILL? It has been a mild Winter. There has been but one real snow storm to date unless we include the short-lived one of Tuesday evening. There has been little really cold weather. In truth, it has been a mild Winter. With this thought in mind, we can't help but wonder about the dangerous condition of the walks and roads on the Union campus. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours at college m the past two months must admit that since the heavy storm on the night of December 20th, Union's byways have not been entirely clear for an hour. The ice piles which are now partly hidden by the latest snow-fall are still nearly as thick as they were when they formed during the thaw which followed the December storm. Why is it that, in a machine age such as that in which we are now living, such conditions go on unheeded. What attempts have been made to rectify the situation? Why can there not be some bit of efficiency in the matter? It is true that some of the walks and portions of the road system have been completely cleared by virtue of the steam pipes which run beneath them. It is also true that the grounds crew is extremely busy with other, supposedly more pressing, tasks. But it is not true that nothing can be done. In the city of Schenectady, a city whose Department of Streets would hardly qualify as a model of efficiency, there has been much progress in clearing the streets of ice and snow. Tuesday night, plows and scrapers were out almost as soon as the snow had stopped falling. Crews have been striving to remove the ice from at least the main streets of the city. Why then can't Union keep its streets clear? We are not asking the college to buy the bulky and expensive equipment needed to clean a city. We see no need for such measures. But one small bull-dozer can hardly handle the problem at hand. We have watched the efforts of the grounds crewman who operates the machine. It is not his fault that the blade clears away only the surface snow, pushing it into the hollows of the underlying ice-sheet and passing harmlessly over the ice itself. We have watched the labors of certain fraternity groups who have managed to free their walks from the clutches of ice and snow by the use of rock-salt and muscle power. Their attempts are laud- able but hardly touch the over-all picture. Would it not be possible for the college to hire men- many students who find their budgets strained or who are wondering about Prom because of the cost would probably jump at the opportunity to pick up some cash-to clear the walks and roads of the ice and snow which now remains neglected? Is rock-salt then so expensive that it would not pay to have the walks cleared? Thinking back but a short while, we remember that at least one member of the college community has been injured because of slippery ice. We m·e not lawyer enough to k:now whether or not a college can be sued but, if suit is possible, further accidents could easily prove more expensive than precautionary measures. We probably won't make ourselves popular with the Freshmen by suggesting that there is a ready source of labor in the Physical Education classes. These men are used at other times during the year to clean up debris, leaves, to install and remove bleachers from the athletic field. What better time could there be than now to employ them in aiding the college. Or possibly the city might be contracted to keep .the college clear of winter obstructions. That could be a sol~tion. No matter what the solution, one must be found,.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1:947 Wiggins Prese,nts Final Prom P'lans For Counc:il Vote Fleming. :sand Hired for Free March I R.P.I. Dance Final prom plans were disclosed l·or the Winter Carnival to be held on the weekend of Febnmry 21 at the fi-rst Student Council meeting uf the new term last Monday night. Last minute arrangements were . left to the prom committee, itsel\f headed by Walter J. Wiggins. Al<omg with plans for decmating the gymnasium, it was announced that many special features will highlight the three day affair, in- cludi-ng a h0ckey game on .Satu-r- day afternoon, a free dance in the gymnasium on Saturday night, and a glee club concert on Sunday afternoon. Easy as Possible Everything within means is being done -to make arrangements for the individual student as easy as pos- sible, stated Wiggins in his ·report to the Council. Not only have many rooms been set aside -in the homes of faculty and friends of the Col- lege, but 40 rooms have been set aside at the Mohawk Hotel for the exclusive use o.f those bringing girls from out of town. He explained to the Council that the ticket, which is selling at $7.00, was set at that price because of the high cost of the orchestra and other special items that were being pur- chased for the weekend. This price wlil include tax. Ma1·ch Dance In regard to the dance which was planned for March 1 to coincide with the RPI game that weekend, Chairman Philip Barnet announced that Frank Fleming's Orchestra had been procured for the night. The dance will be paid for by con- tributions from those attending. The Freshman Dance, which was planned for March 15, has at the present time been cancelled until a future date. Dewey Hall Question as to the exact use to which the new Dewey Hall will be put by the Council was again brought to the fioor with respect to the holding of beer parties in the building prom weekend. It was decided by the Council that according to the interpretation which they have made of the an- nouncement from the president's office regarding the use of the building, such parties may be held by sending requests through the proper channels. Dewey Hall was also officially turned over to Miss Travis' Office for use as a meeting place in the evenings for various activities. This, it was felt, would correct the impi'Oper usage of offices in Wash- burn Hall by these organizations. Campus Chest Again Action was demanded on the Campus Chest. drive which was or- ganized here last term. Complaints that the movement had bogged down were made and that the com- pletion of the drive was not in sight. The Campus Chest is the only collection which will be rnade on the campus this year, announced Chet Marvin, president. It com- poses a long list of \worthy local, national, and Foreign charities,\ to whcih funds have been promised by the Student Council.

Honor student, Harold D. Fox, youngest son of the late President Dixon Ryan Fox under whom the graduates began their college study, spoke for the members of the class. A Warning Apologizing for the many facets of character and personality which \a human faculty of teachers\ had left undeveloped in each graduate, Dr. Whittaker urged the graduates to beware \not of the things you don't know, but of the things you think you know, which aren't so.\ Dr. Whittaker proposed a two point program for happiness and social accomplishment in life: 1-\Choose character and wisdom above mere success. Don't try to be great; but have great ideals, Class Different Fox emphasized the \crystallized purpos-e brought about by years of wal' service\ which differentiated the class from normal college graduating classes.

A prize of two record albums of the winner's choice will bt' awarded for the best contribution. Union to Reduce large EnroHment Union College will begin a grad- .Ja·l return to \optimum enrollment\ uf lesS' than 1,000 with the admis- ,;ion of a normal freshman class of 288 men next September, it was announced previous to mid-year ncess by Dr. Carter Davidson. The September enrollment, while smaller than the class admitted last September, will bring Union't total enrollment up, probably near the all-time maximum high set by the trustees at 1400 to accommodate re- turning veterans. Total enrollment will increase despite the smaller freshman class because only 130 men will be graduated this year. September admissions will include 96 men for liberal arts study, 24 for civil engineering, 72 for elec- trical engineering, 48 for pre- medical studies, 24 candidates for the BS in chemistry degree, and 24 physics majors. The present entering 96 freshman will be the last freshman class to enter Union College in February. This, concluded Dr. Davidson's an- nouncement, should bring about the desired reduction in numbers within the shortest possible time. ---0---- Seven Fire Trucks Rush To Save Psi Upsilon Seven fire trucks and the Sche- nectady Fire Chief were brought to the campus by a false alarm last Wednesday night. The fire was sup- posedly situated in the Psi Upsilon House. This is the second false alarm bringing trucks to Union College this year. Three trucks came last fall when a large brush fire on fra- ternity row attracted the attention of nearby neighbors. For Your PROM \GET UP\ Remember OTT AVIANo•s Sartorial Bar 114 JAY ST.

Talk By Former Lacrosse Coach The lacrosse squad heard an ad- dress in January by Victor Star- zenski, the man responsible for the introduction of lacro>JSe at Union twenty-five years ago, Mr. Starzen- ski coached the Union team that beat the combined Oxford-Cam- bridge team from Englar.d in 1926 by a score of 3-2. He was cited last year by the Lacrosse Association for having done the most for Ia~ crosse during the year. He is at present introducing lacrosse to stu- dents in New Mexico. Mr. Starzenski decried the in- creasing use of encumbering equip- ment because it slows down the game a great deal. He advocates body-checking and frowns upon the players who use the stick as a bludgeon. He stated that lacrosse is a character building game and does much for the participant phys- ically. Coach Fred Wyatt aloo stated during the meeting that Dick Balch '41, who has just returned to Union as Assistant to the President, play- ed lacrosse while an undergraduate and will help coach the squad. Army has asked for a match with Union in April to be held at West Point. The final arrangements await the decision of Hal Wittner, Athletic Director.

In announcing the point totals for the swimming and touch foot- ball contests, intramural dit-ecto:· Art Lawrence stressed the fact that the winner will not necessarily be the team which wins most of the contests in various spo1·ts, since points are earned by squads for entering the competition and play- ing their scheduled games. The tr6phy to be a warded is to be a sizeable affah· and will be suitable for a prominent spot on a fraternity mantlepiece or any trophy case. In addition to the large trophy, one of approximately half its size will be awarded to the runner-up ilil the year long competi- tion. Delta Phi is currently holding down the runner-up position with a total of 186.425 points. Chi Psi is next with 168.570. A spring sports schedule is being planned and Lawrence announced that another swim meet is contemplated after the other winter spOl'ts are finished. A boxing and wrestling tournament is also in the tentative stages of planning.

Vol. LXXIV., No. 16 ''Sub-Fres.hman Weekend'' Begins March 20th; Plan Gala Program On Campus Fraternities to Assist Admissions Office With Housing Problem; Class Visits to Feature Stay Sub-Freshman Weekend will be held for the first time since 1942, on the weekend of March 21, it was announced Tuesday by Richard L. Balch· '41, Assistant in Administra- tion. \Only a program such as this,\ stated Balch, \can adequately present a fair pic- ture of coll'ege life as it exists here.\ l'olky Ch: ngt• In the past the college has turned over a list of appJ.i~ant-s to fra- tel nities on ram pus. This year the administration will allow the fra- ternities to invite men of their own choice. The Office of Admis!O'ions has asked the houses to invite only men who have made or plan to make application for admission to Union. If there are men whom the fraternities wish to interest in the college, the AdmissionS' Office policy will not bar their invitation. The Office of Admissions is hoping that it will be possible to house a rr,inimum of ten men in each on-campus ft•aternity over the weekend. The remainder of the sub-freshmen will be hou&ed in va- cated dormitory space. Al'rangements All arrangements are handled by the rushing chairmen .of the fra- ternities and other recognized social activities on campus, in conjunction with Mr. Balch and the Office of Admissions.

(Continued on Page 4) }I To the Editor -of The Concordiensis: DIE:\'SIS for an assignment of space for alumni items .... \ Sir: \Ve feel that the Friday pro- grams, namely music, are ·by far I the best offered throughout the I week. The selections are well chos<:>n, well played, and are an ex- cellent source of enjoyment and re- laxation to most of us. No doubt, those pCl'sons originally i'esponsible for setting aside ·Friday's Chapel , fat· music had just that in mind. : This is not true insofar HS the editors of the CONCOHDIEN- May I make use of your columns SIS are concemed. The statement to which the Alumni seeretaQ· is referring was a promise by the editors of the CONCORDlENSlS that they would print such ne\·s as they saw fit f1·om the items submitted to the paper l.Jy the office of the Graduate Council. This is the only commitment which we recognize. The secretarr further said in the Administration meeting that he thought it was matel'ial which the paper should print in its entirety. He stated that the editors of the paper were not competent. He is entitled to his opinion. \Ve do not agree. We feel that it is our function to judge all material printed in the newspaper for its news worthiness prior to its insertion. This is the task for which we are here, and it is the function which we intend to continue performing. Regardless of the personal opinion of any member of the Administ1·ation concerning any student, there is no place on the campus for dictatorship ut' eensorship whe1·e the student pul>lications me concemed. If such is to be the case, then the Administmtion should refund to the student body that portion of the student activities tax money which is orcli- narily assigned to the college newspaper. The fact that this is news of the alumni to which :\Ir. Wyatt is refening is in itself of relevance. The mere fact that this is news which does not refer to the student body directly should be a clue to its interest. We feel that only alumni news of singular interest is going to appeal to the student. \Ye do not appreciate the development of a depart- ment in the newspaper without our inclusion in the decision. The only consideration in evaluating a story for the CON- COHDIENSIS is whether ot· not it will interest the student readers. Alumni ne\\'S will be accepted on the same basis as news of any other department in the college. Such news is tal< en with the heretofore clear-cut understanding that the editors m·e free to do with it what they will. If this basic policy is to be altered in an~· \.Hl~· which will give more extensive control to any others than the undergraduates, then it is time to call a halt to student pm·ticipation in the activit~·. This ma,\· be considered a challenge by some, but we feel that we are merely saying again what has been for a number of years the guiding rule of the paper.

DICk had grown up wtth electronics. He had operated his own amateur radio station when he was 14, and at Minnesota he had specialized in communications. With this background of intensive study, he was well-prepared to take advantage of the courses available to him at General Elec- tric .. His outstanding W?rk during two years of high-frequency studies earned him elec- tronics assignments first, in the Research Laboratory, and later, in 1940, with the Transmitter DiYision. Since then Dick Longfellow has been shap- ing for himself the kind of a career he began planning long ago. He has worked in tele- visi?n, has designed _ultra high frequency radio tubes, has contributed to the develop- ment of radar. Today, afte1· ten years with G.E., he is Chief Engineer of the company's Electronics Specialty Division. Next to schools and the U.S. Government, General Elec- tric employs more college engineering graduates than any other organixation, An engineer for his University broadcasting station, Dick handled controls during foot- bell broadcasts. Among his present assignments is included work on radio sonde equipment, used to determine weather data. GENERAL. ELECTRIC fl Swi St. ThH teams legiatE mark d'ays t tested BpOl ts ing th tiona-!.

With opening night not Jar distant, the tempo of rehear- sals has been stepped up con- siderably and the cast has been working- extra hours. The stilted actions and exag- gerated gestures ofeighteenth century England add much to the humor of the play but put much added work on the al- ready overburdened actors. The Mountebank's expect to move back into their old quarters in Hanna Hall in about two weeks pending completion of the new con- struction. \The Rivals ' will be the first production in the t·e· juvenated theater. Construction has been underway for a little over a week on a new proscenium arch for the Mounte- bank's theater, Hanna Hall. The new arch, replacing the aid one made of lathe and canvas, will be of metal lathe covered with plas- ter. To strength the entire back stage structure, a new supporting beam has been added, made of 2-inch by 6-inch and 2-inch by 8- inch beams. The work is estimated to cost $2,500 with more planned for the future. The cast of \The Rivals\ is as follows: Vincent DeBaun as Sir Anthony Absolute; William Warner as Captain Absolute; Irene :\I e- Nally as Lydia Languish; Robert Miller as Bob Acres; Mrs. 0. J.

We would like to have a bit of clarification on something which has been bothering us for the past few days. It seems that someone has stated that there is a clause in the Constitution of the Student Council which says that students may attend Council meetings only with the app1·oval of a majority of the Council. 3. The bool's on the shelf are there for your pleasure, but please do not remove them from the room. Using the above as a referent, I request answers to the following questions: 1. Why is the room locl{ed during hours that the regulations state that it will be open? 2. Why is there a sign on the door at times reading Class in Ses- sion when there is no class in session? tThis was the case at 11:05 a.m. Wednesday, February 19, 1947.) Clifford J.

That is, it should be the prerogative of the Council to close a meeting for discussion, but each such closure should be acted upon separately. After all, the deliberations of this august body are not so momentous that they should be veiled f1·on1 the eyes of the very men who supposedly have taken upon themselves the dut~- of electing them. We feel that every member of the Council should see himself not as a demi-god, not as one set apart from the rest of the college, but simply as the servants of each and every student. We do not feel that secrecy will aid us all in attaining our avowed aims-the betterment of the college. In the interest of the majority of students now in college, we would lil\e to know just why it is necessary for the councillors to seclude themselves? In the interest of the college, we woulcl like to know when, why and how such a provision as this one which we have quoted can have passed the notice of the student body? If there is some concrete reason fo1· this exclusion, it has not been bmught to our attention. OH! WHERE? OH! WHERE? Sirs, Once again, at last Tuesday's Daily Assembly, I had the misfor- tune to watch the Union College peons and peasar.ts in action. Not only do they fail to support any- thing connected in any way with the colle? e, but now they are to be found utterly lacking in man- ners. decency, and taste. Admittedly, perhaps the speaker did not possPss all the qualities many of us hope to find in a Daily As<>embly lecturer, but as college men we should be courteous enough to allow the speaker ample oppor- tunity to present his views on a topic without being subjected to juvenilities. Or is this merPlv another mani- festation of the so'-called \mature\ veteran. F. V. Bronner, '46 We can but add this complaint to the many of like content which have occasione-d themselves from the immatm·e actions of many Union men this year. If we knew specificall~· what might be donP, we would havE> dont> all in om· power to correct this condition.-ED. * * * To the Editor THE CONCORDIENSIS Washburn Hall Dear Sir: Last Saturday night, Union played one of its most traditional basketball games against R.P.I. at Troy. We were impressed by the effectiveness of the R.P.I. cheering and the lack of size in the Union turnout. For such an important game, : Nothing much has been done by Congress J'egar·ding increased sub- sistence allowances but sentiment is getting stron~er in favor of such raises. Figures were released this week to show that pensions are now being paid. to 2,100,000 veterans and nearly 780,000 deper:dents of veter- ans. Over 1,500,000 veterans are going to school Ol' training on the job and 1,250,000 are drawing job- less pay. In addition, nearly 600,- 000 have obtained loans ur:der Vet- erans Administration guarantees. The money necessa1·y to finance the above groups is somewhat stag- gering.

4 Group Hears Coffin Speak Of Geopolitics Says Distances Lessened Greatly by Utilization of Polar Transport Routes \The ramp~rts over which we watch have been extended from the walls of Fort McHenry to the poles,\ said Harrison C. Coffin, Frank Bailey professor of Greek, at a lecture last Friday entitled \Geopolitics and the Importance of the Polar Regions,\ before the In- ternational Relations club in the English reading room. \The strategy of any futm·e war will depend to a large part on the· control of the polar regions,\ he continued. \These natural air highways bring the major cities of the world much closer together.\ He cited Tokyo as being 30C miles closer to Minneapolis than to San- tiago, by the polar route, Chung- king only half as for from Detroit, and MoRcow only a \stone's throw\ away. Mineral Deposits He mentioned the importance of mineral depsits in these areas, and the fact that the United States al- ready has a port in Antarctica. \Russia he said, \has made, and is making, explorations on the Arctic continent.\ He added that England, Holland, Australia, and several other countries are expect- ed to claim parts of both these continents. Geopolitics, according to Profes- sor Coffin, gave rise to the German \Heart Land'' theory. According to this theory, the Heart Land is made up of Europe and Russia and whoever controls the Heart Land controls the World Island, made up of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Con- trol of this land, they theorized, 1 meant control of the oceans and 1 control of the world. This theory 1 completely discounted the British I and American navies. Geopoliti<'s Moral Release Geopolitics was the basis for the German belief that a country had a right to expand, and must ex- pand or die, and that war is neces- sary for the strengthening and vitalizing of a country. The idea that an AI·yan is of a superior 1·ace is a geopolitical idea. The geopolitician also advanced the idea that if the vital spots of a country are broken, the country can be defeated. The influence of this idea can be seen in Rommel's drive for Suez, the taking of Cyprus, the attempt to take Malta, and the crippling of Norwegian de- fense by the capture of a few vital cities. Professor Coffin became interest- ed in geopolitics during the war and has since made several radio speeches on the subject. 0---- Philomatheans, The sweethearts of Sig-ma Chi this week end will be Miriam Dyre escorted by Robert Dunning, Mar- got Hammer with Douglas Albert, Helen Mabie with A.

Barry, Bishop Co- adjuto of the Al·bany Diocese of the Episoco,pal Church, outlined the subject \Christianity as Interpreted by Episcopalians.\ This was the thrid in a series of midweek lec- tures in which prominent district churchmen discuss their approach to religion. The Bishop said that in this day of supposedly high educational standards, it is surely a mark of ignorance for any ma·n at· woman to dismiss religion as irrelevant to education. Any education, to be complete, he stated, must combine B.8. in Civil Engineering-George development of the mind, the body, M. Sauer, Francis A. Szcutlwwslti. and the spirit.

Vol. LXXIV., No. 19 SC Dance Set F-or Alumni Gym; F·ollows R. P. I. Game Fleming 0l'chestra To Play frol.iJ. 10-l; Transport Provided F ot• Students, Dates In an attempt to provide a social note in addition to the athletic nature of the evening, the Student Council is spon- sol'ing an ·informal dance in the Alumni Gymnasium Sat- urday night, March 1. The dance w11l follow the RPI- Union basketball game and wiN run from ten until one o'clock. Because of the late hour at which the game ends, special permission was grant- ed by the Dean to extend the dance past the customary midnight conclusion for Sat- urday night social affairs. Fleming to Play The music is to be supplied by Frank Fleming's band. Fleming is no stranger to the campus as he has played for numerous dances here in the past. His more recent engagements include the Interfra- ternity Ball last November and the Saturday night dance at Winter Weekend. In addition to these functions, Fleming is in constant demand for fraternity parties. The Student Council originally planned to run this dance at no cost to the students. It was to be financed by the profits from the Winter Weekend. Unfortunately, the weekend was not a financial success although a social one. The Council hopes to defray the ex- penses of the .coming dance by means of contributions at the door. On a basis of expected attendance compat·ed with operating costs, the committee feels that a donation of one dollar per couple will defray the cost of the evening. It is hoped that all guests will help make the dance a success. Free Transportation The somewhat difficult problem of transportation from the Sche- nectady Armory to the Gymnasium has been solved by the committee. Several buses have been chartered and will be waiting outside the Armory at the conclusion of the basketball game. All men with dates will be given free transporta- tion to the Alumni Gymnasium. trusts FOUNDED AT UNION COLLEGE IN 1877 SCHENECTADY, N. V., :fRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1947 Price 10c Playing M·onday Night Gordon String Quartet Pair Contributes to Book on Atom Power By ARTHUR WALDIE The combined resources of Union College, led by Edward S. C. Smith, professor of geology and by Dr. Augustus H. Fox, associate professor of mathematics, were used to pro- duce the recent book, \Applied Atomic Power.\ Inspiration for the work came from R. Tom Sawyer, Deisel engineer for the American Locomotive Co., and chair- man ofthe ASlVIE Gas Turbine Co-ordinating committee. He wished to write a book explaining in non-technical terms the application of atomic power to everyday life. Friends Wrote Prelude <S> --------·------ Profess•or Smith and Dr. Fox were his close friends, and. he saw in them the ideal writers of the prelude to his share of the work. Allotted to Professor Smith was the task of writing a description of the Ul'anium minerals, the chief source of atomic enet·gy. Prof. Smtih was well-qualified to do this, having spent some time in research which netted him and Union one of the finest and most complete collections of uranium minerals ex- tant, now on display in the g·eology Not included. in the book is the singular setup at the Oak Ridge plant, whereby most of the pl'o- cesses are completely automatic Verr few operato1·s are necessary at the plant, and those who are re- quired to their work by remote control at a safe distance from the deadly materials handled. Of note is the fact that there has nevee been a stoppage or break- down in this automatic process. Uranium Pile museum. Part Four, written by Sa\\-ye>:, 1 Gordon Quartet Slated for Mon.

It is, ---- he answe1·ed, the study of man and his relation to society. The val'ious departments treat the problems- as follows: history deals with the time element; economics treats the ques- tion of goods and services; and· governtrent discueses man's efforts to live in harmony with other men. The snea·ker mentioned that the division might soon have a new Department of Sociology. Dr. Larrabee told the reasons for the different departments in the Division. The different teachings that satisfy the varied requirement& of the students require some degree of separation and classification. Dr. Larrabee answered the ques- tions of thos-e who ask if the .Social Studies Division practices what it preaches. He said that it was definitely true. As an illustration, he pointed out the telegram sent to Washington defending the appoint- ment of David Lilienthal as head of the AtomiC Energy Com:rmss10n. Dr. Carter Davidson visited San Francisco Monday and Tuesday, February 24 and 25, on his educational tour of the country. He met with mem- 'bers of the Un·i:versity of Cali- fornia faculty at a luncheon held on the Berkeley campus as a part of a nationwide sur- vey on patterns of higher edu- cation.

Headed by Jacques Gordon, famous violinist, the members of this organization are all rotmg men, yet of long and distinguished experience. Jaeques Gordon Mutual sympathy, a capacity for taking endless painE', and the per- severance of t1·ue artists have won them a secure place in the affec- tions of music lovers. Jacques Gordon organized the brilliant group that bears his name when he was only 21, the concert- master of the ·Chicago Symphony. He grew up in Russia, his father be-ing conductor of the Imperial Opera, and when he was 15 came to the Ur.ited States where he studied with the great Franz Kneisel. Jacques Gordon was awarded the highly coveted Eliz- abeth Sprague Cooledge medal for distinguished service to chamber music in 1938. Urico Rossi, second violin, was born in Waterbmy, Conn., and is a gxaduate of the Yale School of Nl,usic, receiving his master's degree at the Eastn.an School of Music. Mr. Rossi has been a member of the Rochester Philharmonic Or- chestra and the Hartford and New Haven Symphonies. During the war he served in the Navy. David Dawson, viola, is the son of a colonel in the United States Marine Corps, growing up in the military atmosphere of Marine Bases. He began his musical train- ing at the age of seven in Char- lottsville, Va, and is a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music. Before joining the Army, he played first vi-ola for 5 years with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, under Dmitri Mittopoulos. F1•itz Magg Fritz Magg, cello, was first cellist with the Vienna Symphony Orches- tm at the age of 20. Winning the International Competition for Cello in Vienna in 1937, he came to this country in 1939. He played with the New Friends of Music Orches- tra, and joined the Army in 1943, serving until January, 1946. He is married to Natasha Magg, a con- cert pianist, and has a year-old son, Kyril. In addition to playing the stand- ard charr.ber-·music repertoire, the Gordon String Quartet has intro- duced works of such noted com- posers as .Schoenberg, Malipiero, Milhaud, Casella, Respighi, Faure, Glazounow, Eugene Goosens, Arnold Bax, Sowerby, Bloch, Emerson Whithorne, Hanson and Vaughan Williams.

NO COFFEE? l\Ionday morniNg, bright and eal'ly, the campus was startled to find that the doors of the College soda-fountain woulrl not open until twelve Boon. This fact had been re- ported in Friday's CONCORDIE;'\SJS but many of the student body harl not ::;een the notice until that da;y. It would be foolish to state that the coHege looked placidly on the picture. It had become a l!nion custom to drop into the \Butt\ or \IIole\ for a morning· cup of coffee. There were indeed man~· long- face::; about Washbum Hall on :\Iondar morning. This week, hovvever, a member of the CONCORDIENSIS staff spoke to :\II·. Anthony Hoadley, Comptroller of the College and gleaned the following information: This yea1·, the soda-fountain has been running on a twelve hour basis-from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. This ar- l\angement necessitated split shifts of workers. Students carried the brunt of the evening business. In addition, there have been hours, not as long, during \.vhich the Snack Bar in Hale House was open for simihu· business. Unde1· the new system, the soda-fountain will be open from noon until eight at night. There will be no need for the wevious arrangement of split working shifts and the distribution of business should be more even. l\Ir. Hoadley realizes that the new system imposes some inconvenience on certain students but feels that things will work out satisfactorily. In any case, he feels that it should be tried out for a while. We can't say that we favor the changes made. That would be entirely untrue. But, in the interest of efficiency and if this method will save on expenses, we feel that the new hours should be given a fair chance. Suggestions will be gladly 1·eceived by the CONCORDIENSIS and 1·elayed to l\Ir. Hoadley. What do you think? FAIR ENOUGH? ROSEBUD~??

Rumor might be Tuesday noon, from the chancel of l\Iemorial Chapel, Chet l\Iarvin, President of the Student Council, advocated a fair and widespread competition for membership in next yeal\s Council. We feel that this is the best move in recent years to come forth in student government. Just how the election is to be held, we don't know. It was mentioned that cit~; voting machines would be sought. The idea is a praiseworthy one. It is only necessary now, we believe, to arouse enough interest in equitable govern- ment in order that the suggestion become reality. For several months we have been occasionally exposed to your edi- torials on school spirit, fair play, and sportsmanship, Evidently these had no effect on a certain group of students. same insulting things to the play- er's face. We eincerely doubt this. As Professor Larrabee would say \Rete's where we separate the men from the boys.\ . defined also as a self-generated, de- moralizing propaganda. But .on second thought, there is sometimes basic truth in the background. At the present time a vet'Y demoraliz- ing rumor is circulating throughout the veteran's housing unit-Dutch- man's Village. If there is any basis for the rumor, we are at a loss to know where to find it. All known channels have been tapped to no avaiL We now submit our case to the readers of the CONCORDIEN- SIS. hoping that the real authority It is a well-known fact that, in the past, Councils, and in some cases, class officers, have been railroaded into posi- tion by certain pressure groups on campus. The main reason for this is that the only group to have organized and carried out its platform has been the fraternity group. Despite the thoughts of many, this is not dirty politics. It is not the concern of one group that no other arises to question its supremacy. It is all the better for the first group if such is the case. Now however, there is no need for this. There are enough men in other groups to build their own platform and carry on a closely-contested election. The time draws near~ If the Council President's thought is to be realized, now is the time for ALL parties to organize. YO-HO! NOBODY AT HOME! Wednesday night, Union played Stevens Tech in the fifth home game of the basketball season. Just for the books, we won! For the many of you who found more important things to do, the score was 72-45. Not even close, was it? And a look at the picture on the Sports page will indicate that the crowd wasn't even close to filling the Drill Shed. Take another look! Those empty seats belong to you! At each of the home ·basketball games we have noticed the obvious lack of good manners on the part of SOME Union studentiOl. Each time that Coach Boehm sends in certain players as substitutes, they are greeted by hisses, boos, and derogatory remarks. It seems that these men ar.e not in the favor of the offenders, not because of lack of ability. but be- cause they are not members of the offending clique. These men have devoted their time and energy to the team since the initial basktball practice, They at·o representatives of Union, and should be given the same amount of respect and backing that any other member of the squad re- ceives, The spectators who hav.e been making all the noise are not help- ing the team's morale ot• the school's reputation. Remember, some fellows do have feelings. Go- ing out on the court after being greeted with a chorus of \boos\ certainly isn't helping the team. The fellows who have been yelling the loudest for a winning team are those doing the most to prevent it. If the grandstand critics are such .experts, why don't they favor us with a little exhibition at any Varsity practice session. Criticism comes easy, but what about play- ing ability? We would also like to know whether or not the offenders would have the nerve to say the Respectfully, Norman L. Kreisman '47 Wade W.

Last season RPI invaded Schenectady, ready to follow the experts predictions and wallop the Garnet by at least a 20 point margin. A dazed and amazed Cherry and White squad awoke at the end of the match to find itself on the losing end of a 45-44 tally. Frequently Union has entered this match as the underdog, only to emerge with a surprising victory. Tomorrow night might well be a repetition of past history. Coach \Whitey\ Boehm will start his usual first team lineup. Cap- tain Bill O'Neil will tip off at center. Flashy guards \Whitey\ Markes and Dick Roberts will as- sume their usual posts. Jim Fern- rick and high scoring ft•eshman Jim Schultz are slated to occupy the forward berths. This quintet has flashed hot and cold at various times and Union's hope lies in the fact that it should be hot tonight. Dutchmen Vs.

Bears Watching The Garnet will have to keep close tabs on Don Ferguson, stellar Hamilton forward. Ferguson has proved a thorn in the side of rivals all season. In his previous meet- ing with Union he personally ac- counted for a total of 20 points and scored them on such a variety of shots that the Dutchmen had trouble stopping him. Boehm will start Markes and Roberts. guards; O'Neil, center; and Pemrick and Schultz, for- wards. Markes is likely to be given the assignment of guarding Fergu- son since he has demonstrated ex- ceptional defensive ability. JV's Also Play Pete Nistead, junior varsity coach, will send his charges into their fourth and fifth contests of the current campaign. The JV five lost in a previous encounter with the RPI juniors and scored the lirst junior varsity victory in Union histm·y when it defeated the Hamil- ton jayvees by a narrow 33-32 margin. Nistead is likely to start Tim Shea, Dom Petrone, Bill Grant, Dave Lennek and either Jack Mun- son or Chuck EmmL Nistead is :noulding a potent combination and should have a surplus of material on hand when he assumes varsity tutoring duties next year.
