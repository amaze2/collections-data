Our grounds are un- rivalled; our campus is without a parallel; and it should be the pleasurable duty of every student to see that nothing is done to mar the beauty of our surroundings. IT IS beginning to dawn upon the col- lege that we have a good foot ball team. The chronic growlers had their say earlier in the season when things did look dubi- ous even to the most optimistic n1inds. The more conservative tongues were silent until after the Amherst and Williams games, but then they were all set wag- ging in praise of Captain Brown and his men,. The game with West Point signi- fies nothing as to the strength of the Union team, crippled as it was by the · loss of some of its most valuable men. One more week will see us well into the league contests with all our recuperated strength, and that means that the third pennant in succession is coming to Union.

However, . in the present class tllere seem.s to be a large nla- jority who either have never heard of, or else have forgotten that there is a custorn regarding the order of the classes leaving chapel. If they have never heard of it perhaps it would be well to state here that it is Seniors first, Juniors second, Sopho- mores thir·d and Freshmen LAS'.r. We would ren1ind them that some deference should be shown to the men who have been here longer than they and that it is exceedingly annoy- ing for a Senior, for instance, to find himself sur- rounded and stepped upon by a lot of Freshmen. The Juniors and Sophomores are not above re- proach in the matter either, and it would be much Inore appropriate if they would leave a trifle more spaqe between the respective classes in their exit.\ · find themselves benefit,ted by them.

While in town ]or the foot ball ga1ue on Satur- day last. son1e twenty Seniors ·Of Union spent a · par,t of the day at the New York State Geological . Museum, where the rocks and fossils of the differ- ent New York geoiogicalforinations were described . to tll.em by Charles S. Prosser, the newly appointed · Professor of Geology at Union. Under the progressive administration of Presi- dent Raymond, the scientiFic departments of the coUege are being very n1 uch st.rengthened, and in line with this advancement is the organization of the new Department of Geology. 'The New York' geological formations are the standard series with which the sin1ilar for1nations of other ·states are compared, and it is the plan of Union to pay·espe- . cial attention to the geology of this State. The • students visit typical geological localities, collect · speciin:ens and later exa1nine the collections in the St;;.,te museum. The location of Union is such that it is possible · . by a trip of one or two days to study any New York forn1ation in the field; and when it is retnem- bered that in this eity are the unrivalled collections of :rocks and fossils collected by the New York · State survey, it will, be readily seen that U n1on has · exceptional material advantages for the study of geology, and this fact being recognized by the new administration, it seems probable that in a com- paratively short tin1e Union will become one of the leading schools of geology in the State.-Al- · bany JouTnal. fl]e Foot Ball P·layer.

His father, Nathan Allen, was a n1en1ber of one of the oldest Puritan fa1nilies in 1f ew England. In .1834, the brothers were graduated fron1 Union College.

The new chapel regulations, which we published in a former issue, and which were put into immediate operati_on seem to meet with the unanimous ap- proval of the undergraduate body. So far, we have reason to believe that the alterations in the rules governing recita- tions will meet with similar approbation. W RILE not as unfortunate as many other colleges in accidents to the 'varsity foot ban men, Union feels the loss of two of her best players. The regret at the dis- abiling of Sweetland, '97, in the Amherst- Union game, has risen a step nearer con- sternation by the loss, for this season, of the efficient playing of Beckwith, '96.

Near, a Inaiden's cheek is waiting, For a Tnan with courage strong; Bold enough to risk in taking, All reproaches as to wrong. Let him take the kiss he's wanted, From those ruby lips so fair, With a courage still undaunted; Lookin:g out for Madame Me1·e. If too sweet, as he may :find it, He another yet Inay take ; For the chance is ready, waiting, And the game is worth the stake. Kiss her once, nay, kiss her often; 'Though the blushing maid objects; Though she calls you \bad\ and \horrid And the n1eanest of your sex. Afterwards, then ask her pardon, When you've had those stolen sweets; Tell her you '11 return tbe kisses, Which you took fron1 ber fair cheeks. Ask her, then, for her forgiveness; Tell her you '11 ne'er do it more; And to make the bargain binding, Kiss her as you did before. CLARENCli~ McKENZIE, N. Y. u. fl paradox.
