WELCOME HOME, ALUMNI :\Iost cordially do '\e the students of Union welcome you, our alumni, hack to the fold, to live over again those years which ever bring to your minds thoughts of some of the most joyous days of your life. You will han an opportunity to see us in our daily tasks. :\n unusual feature of the return of the alumni this year is the effort which is heing made to give them an insight into the class- J\oom work as it is done today. In former years the reception ac- corded the al·umni ·has been simply ·one of a<musement,-smokers, teas, dances, athlttic contests and the like,-but this year something of a little more serious vain is to be introduced. This afternoon the alumn·i will have an opportunity to visit the laboratory classes, particularly appealing to the technical man and tomorrow morn·ing the regular recita-tions will be optn for inspection. It is hoped that the alumni will avail themselves of this chance· to see in operation the scholastic side of Union as it is today. UNION WILL WIN The largest crmvcl of the season, includiBg a large number of almnni, will have the pleasure tomorr·ow afternoon on Alexamler field at 2:30 o'clock of witnessing what promises to be the hardest ,-ought fuothari contest on the local field this season. The Hobart de\·en·, one of the best that has been clevelope'cl in recent ytars, will oppose Coach Perry Leary's charges. The Garnet teatn is certain to give a good account of itself, for the present eleven is nm.v about to reach the apex of its form and ·we have hut to look back o\·er the season t·o prove this. \Vith a line almost totally inexperienced at the opening of the season Captain Bellinger's cohorts 'lost the first game to Clarks&fl-,-14 to 0. In the second g-ame against St. Lawrence the gr·een team sho\11ed a decided impn>wn1ent on r the previous week ancl he'ld the veteran upstater:- to a 7 to 0 dctory. Constantly imprm·ing the Cnion aggregation went to Micldle\ hmy the following· week where it showed its strength and the value of experience. The strong i\Iiddlebury College eleven, which the .following vreek held the Harvard aggregation to a 6 to 6 tie, fought the Schenectady boys to a 7 to 7 tie. To see the St. Lawrence game and the next week the :\fiddlebury contest one could hardly believe one·~ ( n·~. fnr it was a changed team and one which every Union! t11'an l'o.nld he most proud. The week after the Amherst team. which the \\\eek before had held the Columbia eleven scoreless, likwise fought the Cnion team to a 0 to 0 tie in the stiffest sort of a battle marked only by the finest kine! of football. In this game, as in the :\Iiddlehury con test, the C nion men dearly outfought thei·r oppon- .c.·nt:::;, gaining- m·er two first downs in the latter game to every one for tl~e visitors. :\ wet k later the Rochester outfit came here and struck the Camet ele\'en in the midst of its mid-season slump. Union, how- ever, came through with a 7 to 0 victory. Saturday the Garnet grid- ders itwacled Trinity .College at Hartford, Conn., and scored a 14 to 0 win, completely outclassing its oppon(nts. The s•lnoothness and reg-ularity with which the Union eleven functioned in th·is last game was noteworthy. It is to be noted that in each contest the Garnet team has improved. Anyone who has seen a majority of the games is convinced of that fact. t:'nion will face its hardest test tomorrow and playing its best, despite the loss of a number of regulars due to injuries, should come off the field a winner and a team of which all Union men can be most proud_ 'Tis Union's Day.

Tl;~ WILLIAM KONRAD ROENTGEN 1845-1923 Born in Lennep, Prussia. Edu- cated at Zurich. Awarded the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society in 1896 jointly with Philip Lenard for discovery of X-rays. Won the Nobel Prize in ·physics .in 1901. The General Electric Company manufactures everything electric- from fans to powerful locomotives, from tiny l~mps to mighty power plants. Its products ~e used around the :world. ''I did not think-- . I investigated\ One day in 1895, Roentgen noticed. that a cardboard coated with fluorescent material glowed while a nearby Pluecker tube was in action. ''What did you think?\ an English scientist asked him. ''I did not think; I investigated,'' was the reply. Roentgen covered the tube with black paper. Still the cardboard glowed. He took photographs through a pine door and ·dis- covered on them a white band correspond- ing to the lead beading on the door. His investigation led to the discovery of X-ray.s. Roentgen's rays have proved an inestim- able boon to humanity. In the hands of doctor and surgeon they ate saving life and reducing suffering. In the hands of the scientist they are yielding new knowl- edge - ev.en of the arrangement and structure of atoms. The Research Labora- tories of the General Electric Company have contributed greatly to these ends by developing more powerful and efficacious X-ray tubes.

For over 20 years a Union eleven has not crt. ssed a Hamilton goal line at Clinton, and it is a certainty that the Buff and Blue does not intend that this week shall be the first. on their own two yard line. =======r~~~::::~==~;:::~~:::::::===== As the game drew to a close, · J The seasHn for Hamilton has been none too bright, hut it will her· Captain Bellinger's men, a team :fult of fight and the battle is surt: tt' he one to the end. It is to be rem.embered that Hamilton defeated St. La\',-rence, which a few weeks before had beaten Union, <~Tlll that in the Rochester contest the Buff and Blue crossed the Fin\\'( 1 iCty goal no less than four times and in each case fumbled iiil' :1all or met with some other unfortunate break. In other word,, I l amtlton easily outplayed Rochester. T\\'u years ago mo:;t of us will remetn.her that the Garnet ele\·en tuJk the fie.lcl at Clinton against a Hamilton eleven which had not scored a point all season and on that da.y scored a touchdown by 3heer dint of fight and courage and came off the field victorious. C'nion has much good reason to feel proud of its victory Satur- day owr Hobart, but at no time should the idea become prevalent that the Garnet eleven is to have an easy time at Hamilton. If Ham- ilton wins from Union, it has had a successful season, for its time honored rival has falle11 .hefore its smashing attack. Let every Cnion man he at the game and hy the exemplification of the true Cnion spirit, the Garnet cannot lose. Keep that chapel hell .from tolling its note of victory. Union's last •chance to s·core went for naught, when North intercepted Mil- liman's pass on the Hobart twenty yard line. Shapiro skirted ·left end fifteen yards to the H0bart five yard line. On the next play, a repitiJtion of the previous one, Shapiro gained a yard around right end. North added a yard through the line, but a forward\ pass O\'er the goal line was incomplete as the game ended. ALUMNI ELECT COUNCIL MEMBERS The varsity followed the ball in 'true winning spirit. Toward the end of the fir.st quarter, a avalanche of line men fell on Krause as he booted the ball and blocked his kick, as it left I his toe.

The Garnet Freshman football team under the guidance of \Hal\ Wittner, assistant director of athletics, com~ plet·ed a perfect season by winning all of their games and keeping their op- ponents scoreless, while the Yearlings, themselves, amas·sed a total of 122 points. The season was a complete succes:s, the yearlings displaying fight and aggressiveness in every gq.me, •com- • pletely. ~utplaying their rivals. Due credit must be given to Coach Hal Wittner and Athletic Director Elmer Q. Oliphant for the remarkable record establis.hed by t·he Freshman aggr.egation. The thorough taining in the fundamentals of the game, which the Yearlings received, was evinced throughout the enti.re season. In every conte•st they completely out-witted and outplayed their opponents. The men around whom the team was built deserve special mention. Brigham and Pratt showed exceUent form. Mackie, DCJ.vis, and Clark have · proven their ability while Durkee, \1 Boutellier and O'Neil starred on many occasions. The entire team s.howed that it was the hes•t freshman eleven Union has ever had. Judging from present indications matty of the men should be heard from next fall.

At the fina.J meeting of the executive committee and volunteers in the Union College 11 emonal Fund campa:gn held \Vednesday night, at 6:30 o'clock in the ;\.fohawk Club, it was announced . that :a total of $86,761.31 had been subscribed up to that tiHle. There are quite a few workers who have no-t as yet filed their reports with the cam- paign man.agers, and it is believed . that when these are known, and the \\'ork of the volunteers during the re- mainder of this week has bee!L added in, that the ultimate goal of $100,000, will be reached. The intention of the workers and membe-rs of the executive .committee is to continue until the $100,000 goal is reached. Among the reports yet to be received are those from the cq1ployes of the American Locomotive Com- pany, where t·he employes are asked to subscribe through the heads of their departmen.ts.

Dawson is now coach of the 'University of Ne•braska's football team which has !been playing a wonderful game this season. His letter, addressed to \Hal\ Whitt- ner says: Dttar Hal: I really was very muoh pleased to 1 get yom letter of. the twelfth. It \ tickled me absolutely to ~ieces to le~rn I that the boys beat Hamilton at Chn- ton.

My hat is off to Perry Leary and the boys and I want you to hand them my hand shake very heart- ily. Give my r·egards to good old Howard Opdyke and all the rest for I frequently think of them and ymt all very affectionately. I would love to be bade there to meet our old crowd- in fact it would please the as much as anything I can think of.
