That these worlds should be so l near alike in all their properties and relations ; · so near, as compared with the worlds of outer 1 space, and so closely linked in their origin, growth and destiny, and yet that they should differ greatly in this respect would seem a great discord in the harmony of Nature. We are led to wonder what tnanncr of crea- tures inhabit the planet ; but this is, of course, a hopeless question at present. The recent discovery of the canals, \vhich seern to bear- tificial works requiring n1uch engineering skill, would suggest that Mars is the abode of intelligent beings and this is not at all inl- probable. If such is the case hovv unfortu- nate that we cannot reach them. Son1e bold designer has suggested that sig- nals on a large scale be erected, proclaiming I son1e general principle of Nature, whose truth \Vould be recognized by the savants of either world. I nterpr-:ting the signification of this, perhaps our ans\ver vvould be devised. The two planets would thus be in con1munication ; the Atlantic cable vvould be superceded and the germ of new and novel relations \Vould take life. The execution of this project is a broad and great opportunity for son1e tran- scendent genius, and doubtless this n1ay sug- gest to some hopeful youth a means of be- conling immortal, by working out the details of the scheme.

They have been approved by the Executive Con1·mittee and by the officers of the N evt York and Albany alutnni associations and by the president and faculty of the college. The purpose is clearly evident in the organi- zation of the course and the rules providing for it-that it shall not interfere \Vith the reg- ular college curriculun1 and duties and shall impose as little labor and interference \vith the regular duties and vvork of the faculty as possible in accotnplishing the purpose.
