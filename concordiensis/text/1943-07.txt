No. 1 Leadership Not Myste,rious Gift States Dr. Ligon Combat Leader Must Get Results, Ligon Asserts In Convocation Address \The Choice of a Combat Lead- er\ was the topic of the principal address given by Psychology Professor Ernest M. Ligon at the 149th opening convocation of the college last Tue&day morning in Memorial Chapel, \A good combat officer must have foresight. But there is no evidence that palmis- try, astrology, tea leaves, or se- ances ever helped to predict the next move of the enemy. The com- ·bat officer who most accur.ately forsee.s what the enemy will do is able to consider every thing the enemy possibly can do and plans how to meet every one of them\ Dr. Ligon, who iE' an Expert Con- sultant to the War Department, said in his speech. \Power of leadership is not the mysterious gift it was once thought to be,\ said Dr. Ligon \In modern warfare selection officers use this very simple defin.ition: A leader is a man who has the ability to do a job and to persuade other men to do the job along with him.\ Dr. Ligon said that many tests were applied to young officers in training, which he was not at lib- erty to discus~. But one of the first qualities sought is ability to get results, to reach the objective. That officer succeeds best who can make every man in his unit cooperate. \So a large majority of an officer's duties in battle as well as in train- ing involves teaching. Many well- informed men have not the ability to impart their information to oth- ers.\ \The second quality is foresight. This does not mean an uncanny ability to see into the future, but -is the result of hard study.\ \A good officer,\ said Dr. Ligon, \must be able to consider every possible move of the enemy in given cir- cumstances. \The third quality necessary in good combat leaders is a;bility to deal with unexpected emergencies. This has nothing to do with in- stinct or occult qualities. It means simply that when a sudden emergency arises the man can still think. He may be frightened half to death but his mind still works. The fourth qua!Hy,\ Dr. Ligon said, \is a wide range of practical skills. Even boy scout merit badges pay dividends in the jungle. The final quality is an ability to instill morale in one's men.\ Morale is not shown by hysteri- cal enthusiasm dm·ing emotional experiences. It is continuing spirit during the drudgeries of routine. \Not long ago when I was on duty at one of our large training centers\ said Dr. Ligon, \I learned of one company commander who took one batch of raw recruits af- ter another and turned them out three months later as the crack (Continued on Page 3) Wa,r-Time Log of Unio.n CoJiege Campus SCHENECTADY, N.Y., FRIDAY, JULY 9, 1943 Price 5c Assembly Schedule Monday, Juiy 12 - Professor· Wilford H.

'1'!1e paint that evening was supplied by the sophomores who generously &1- lO\ved the freshmen to paint the , statue with their hands to the en- couraging remarks of their c:J.ptors. Though the chosen few had been t.horoughly terrorized, their daunt- less classmates, spurred on by their indignity to the honor of thcil' class, were out in full strength ~he nex:t evening. While their martinets were mobilizing for the warfare that was to follow, the yearlings painted the Idol gr-een for the first time this year. The organized up- per class attacked and repainted the-lioness-with-her--cub l'ed with the again willing captured fresh- men However, the neophytes would 'Pave none of this and captured the statue once again. This time the Idol had its second coat of green paint applied that evening. The nexL evening the fights were resumed with a more deadly pm~ pose. Early in the evening one of the youngsters was captured and led to Vale Cemeter-y, where he was relieved of his cbthes and bound witl! rope among the gravestp,nes. His classmates, meanwhile, resum- ed the painting of the famous 'and· mark, making its first coating of that day green. Howevel', the great- ly outnumbered Class of 1946 fought and took possession of this valuable site aided br enterpt'i;s- ing .classmates who turned off the :stl·eet lights on the campus. Lig-ht was restored by some unknown ~ua1dian of the college lights. A new wrinkle was introdnccrl Friday evening when to enable the red paint of the sophomores to covet• .better, the ca:ptured were sent up the back of the lioness, clothed only in porous briefs, to remove :>ome ()f the wet. gr-een paint which covered the back of the statue.

The official freshman caps must be worn in Schenectady on all occasiom until October 31. Ex- ceptions are Sundays and recesses. Until such time as caps are pro- cured white handkerchiefs must be worn on the arm in plain view. 2. All freshman are to learn and be able to repeat when called upon: The fi1·st verse and chorus of the Alma ·Ma~€1\ the· Dutchmen Song, and the Terrace Song. 3. F1·eshman are to remain E'eat- ed until upperclassmen have filed out of chapel and student body meetings. 4. F1·eshman are to use Campus paths and not the lawns. 5. All freshmen must tip their freshmen caps to upperclassmen when paE'sing them on the street or on Campus. The foregoing are the official freshmen rules fol' the class of 1947, a.pp1 oved not only by the sophomore class but also duly passed upon and approved by the student council of Union College .. Rules without enforcement are just as out .of place as a fresohman without his freshmen cap. That's where the Sophomore Dis- cipline Committee comes in. Ac- cording to Donald Dalton, tempor- ary chairman of the Sophomore class, the Sophomore discipline committee has set up a court of five justices: Douglas Allart, Alpha Delta Phi dorm, John Hathaway, Delta Upsilon dorm.

Vol. LXVII. No. 2 Paint Stocks Rise As '46-'47 Battles De(orate The Idol Outnumbered Sophomores Vanquish Spirited Frosh In 3 Nightly Adventures Once again the silence of the eol- lege night is broken ·by sounds of th·e annual sophomore - freshman fight over the Idol, the Ch:nese image which stanqs over the tni- ditional scene of interclass :;craps. This year's tiffs began last Wed- nesday evening when a freshman from Oldgyrn Dorm and one ft•om Delta Chi were aroused from slum· ber and taken from their rooms to paint and worship the Idol. T!'!e paint that evening was supplied by the sophomores who generously al- lowed the freshmen to paint the 1 statue with their hands to the en- couraging remarks of their c:1ptors. Though the chosen few had been thoroughly terrorized, their daunt- less classmates, spurred on by !.heir indignity to the honor of their class, were out in full strength ~·he next evening, While their martinets were mobilizing for the warfare that was to follow, the yearlings painted the Idol green for the first time this year. The organized up- per class attacked and repain~ed the-lioness-with-her-cub red With the again willing captured fresh- men. However, the neophytes would !>ave none of this and captured the statue once again. This time the Idol had its second coat of green paint applied that evening. The next evening the fights were resumed with a more deadly pur- pose. Early in the evening one of the youngsters was captured and led tQ Vale Cemetery, where he was relieved of his clothes and bound with rope among the grayest~nes. His classmates, meanwhile, resum- ed the painting of the famous 'and- mark, making its first coating of that day gi·een. However, the great- ly outnumbered Class of 1946 fought and took possession of this valuable site aided by enterpri3- ino- classmates who turned off the ~t;:'eet lights on the campus. Lii;ht was restored by some unknown g-uardian of the college lights. A new wrinkle was introdncerl Friday evening when to enable the red paint of the sophomores to cover ·better, the captured were sent np the back of the lioness, clothed only in porous briefs, to remove ~orne of the wet, green paint which covered the back of the statue. Then more willing ( ?} neophytes were assigned to paint the image red. Having some paint left they began to paint themselves red, rivaling their classmates who were bedecked in green. from their trip up the Chinese idol's back. Saturday evening some Navy stu- cents painted the Idol blue 'lnd gold. Since ihen, due to Schenec- tady's sunny climate ( ?} and the heavy dews which have been fall- ing, the Idol li~s ·been left in com- partive peace and up to last eve- ning still spolj'tec! the Navy's blue and gold.

UNION COLLEGE-JULY, 1943 It was the same sta:id memorial to John Howard Payne which stood majestically before the portal·s o.f Union Col- lege maintaining its silent vigi·lance; it was the same library which beckoned in the di·stance to all those who entered within the gates. It was the same chapel bell which tolled s leepHy acl'oss the campus of the college OR the hill. To all appearances, Union College-July, 1943, was exactly the same as tho·se who had departed in the storrny month of April had left her. True, the ivy cliHging to the scarred gray , walls was now thicke1·; the light green bHds of spring had ·turned into the deep verdant foliage of summer. The heat was certainly greater. To the incoming freshman, however, Union College held out the same hope-the same expecta- tion-which she has offered to her entering sons for gen- el'ations. And to those of us who had already tasted col- lege life within Ramee's walls, she still would have beckoned I with a richer fullfillment of the gifts which .she had but begun to impart if we had not known . \ But when college closed last April, the student body , had been advised that the Navy was definitely going to 1 establish a unit at Union College. All through the spring 1 vacation, announcements were .sent out explaining how the college expected over 500 Naval Cadets; how the college '-------------------------~ had decided to take over all fraternities; how campus ac- CHOPPY SEAS tivities would necessarily have to be curbed.

July 16, 1.943 THE CONCORDIENSIS Page Four Ketz Leaves Union For Washington 'Magnificent Dope' Talent Wanted to To Be Presented to Liven Navy Shows Dutchman's Song By S. M. S. Professor Wilford H. Ketz, direc- tor of ad·missions, left Union Wed- nesday, having received a tem- porary appointment to do investi- gative work with the Truman Com- mittee. His government positio::l began yesterday and he will return to the campus to continue as Ad- missions Director September 14. In 1932 Professor Ketz came to Union as an aseociate professor of physical education and he has since held the ·positions of teacher in American government which course was abolished when the change of the divisional arrangement took place, and instructor in economics as well as his physical education duties. Last year when Frederic Wyatt left for service as an of- ficer in the Navy, Professor Ketz was named Director of Admissions. Professor Ketz remarked that co- incidentally enough, Congress closes when he arrives and the date set for convening is the date he leaves. Ketz received a law degree from the University of Michigan and this job provides him with an op- portunity to brush up on his habeas corpora since the Tru- man Committee is set up for the purpose of investigating defense in- dustries and contracts. ----o---- Freshman Picnic Held Last Monday Evening At the first gathering· of the fresh- man class in Old Chapel on Monday, the rules of freshman decorum were explained by Student Council Presi- dent Karl Klarman. Professor Wilford H. Ketz, direc- tor of admissions, acted as chairman for the meeting. Those who spoke to the freshmen were President Dixon Ryan Fox, Professor William Bennett, co-ordi- nator of student activities, and Klarman. Dr. Fox welcomed the freshmen and told them of some of the traditions of Union. Professor Bennett told of the activities on campus and of their value. He also told of the opportunities for fresh- men to participate in these activi- ties. Klarman then read off the freshman rules. After the meeting, the group ad- journed to Jackson's Gardens for a picnic supper served by the staff of Hale House. After t'he trad,itional hot dogs and potato salad, the up- perclassmen taught the freshmen the college songs. The emphasis in the singing was put on \The Dutchmen Song,\ \The Alma Mater\ and \The Ter- tace Song\ which all freshmen were required to know by the fol- lowing morning. N~avy Men Sunday With the entertainment program for Union College naval trainees stepping into high gear, the sec- ond in a series of moving picture shows is slated for the Old Chapel this Sunday evening at 2030. Headlining this week's bill is '\The Magnificent Dope,\ a Holly- wood feature production. The eve- ning's program will also include a short. Robert Owen, a trainee, will entertain on the piano. The series of free motion pictures for V-5 and V-12 men here was in- augurated last Saturday evening with the showing of \Footlight Serenade\ featuring Betty Grable and Victor Mature. It is planned to have the series span sixteen weeks in all, with carefully select- ed \Class A\ films shown exclusive- ly. Owing to the U. S. 0. dance on Satm day evening, the time for this week's show was moved up to Sunday evening. A12 trainees here are urged to attend. The Old Chapel is located in the northeast corner of Hale House. ----0 Kummer, Stanco Study Meteorology at NYU NEW YORK, N. Y.,-Two Union College alumni are attending New York University's college of en- gineering where they are studying a course in meteorology under the direction of the Army Air Forces Technical Training Command. On completion of their course this summer, they will be commissioned second lieutenants in the Army Air Forces>. They are: Paul E. Kummer, '43, Bloomfield, N. J., and Patsy A. Stanco, '41, Schenectady. Requirements for the military weather forecasting course are ex- tremely high, calling for at least two years. of college work includ- ing mathematics and phyeics. Graduates of the advanced me- teorology course, which is a !so taught at other selected universi- ties throughout the country, will give vital weather information to pilots of the Army Air Forces. On the accuracy of tha:t information may depend the success of a com- bat miesion and the safe return of airplanes and their crews. BILL'S BARBER SHOP Nott Terrace Open 9:00 A. M. Till 8:00 P. M.

But the reason is not that i.\lrs. Briggs is trying to get more money on the side. It is not that Bill South, who SQmetimes works from 5 :30 A. ~I. until 10 P. ;.\l. at night, is trying to poison as many people as he can with- out being discovered. Nor is it the sobriety of the chefs. A quick glance at the headlines of any newspaper will tell why one cannot h.ave all one wants to eat and why one must at times eat food which isn't as pleasing to the appetite as sirloin steak. The Solomons, Russia, Tunisia-and Sicily, these are the reasons why Hale House, why the Ritz, the Waldorf Astoria, Harry Jones, and J.\Iary Smith are not get- ting ali the food they want, the kind of food they want, when they want it. To hide one's head in the sand and cry, \I want to be fed 'as usual',\ is simply denying the fact that we are at wal'. To believe that the consequences of trJs war will strike all the people of America and skip over Hale House as a sacred place because we, the students of Union College, eat there is certainly being hypocritical. The Gov- ernment of the United States has told the people in plain language that there will be ENOUGH food to go around.

Under the plans set for the physical training program, the lowest 30 percent of the trainees will repeat their basic training during the second sixteen week period here. The basic training pro- gram, in which all trainees here are now engaged, is to run for six- teen weeks. Sports During Second Term Lieutenant Zenti pointed out that the second eight weeks of the basic training program will differ from the first half, which concludes its fourth week tomorrow. Emphasis will be placed then upon competi- tive sports rather than general cal- isthentics. At the conclusoion of this term, the upper 70 percent will be re- garded as having satisfactorily completed their basic training pro- gram, Lieutenant Zenti pointed out. They will then be enrolled in the Maintenance Program, which will be built around competitive sports. All sports will be played, according to the season of the year. Varsity sports are open to all Navy men, Lieutenant Zenti stated, though they will take part in these sports as no special group, but, along with civilians, as members of the student body here. The only restriction on participation in in- tercollegiate athletics is tile main- tenance of a satisfactory academic standing, a prerequisite for all extra-curricular activities. ----0---- Wage Rates Hit New Low A new low in hourly wages has been reported to us recently by a new~ hound at the Sigma Phi Place.

Eight hours later Bob slipped into his pants, shoes and tvvo sleeves surrounding a V-neck. Gone, all gone, was the collar. Not one atom of that gleaming collar was anywhere to be seen.

Then there is Bob LaPann who, noting the creases !not foldsl on his collars,--he sends his laundry out-determined that by some man- ner or means he would secure an iron. He did. Bob inserted an ad in The Union- Rtar requpsting some kind housE>- wife to donate an old iron to a 1onP· somP sailor. Bob now is sP!ling irons for 40 CPnts the half dozPn. He's received so many phone calls and letters that BQ is deducting from hi& salary for the next 22 mos. the cost of 4 additional opera- tors, mail carriers and other fa- cilities. The letters included two offers of marriage with free iron- ing for life and the offer to sell one slightly used self-ironer for $6 down and 90c a week for 10 years. Bob pointed out that the N. Y.

To add extra flavoring to the evening's entertainment, sev- CI'al impromptu jam sessions were staged with various trainees sitting in with the band of the evening and \sending solid.\ The two dances have been receiv- ed most warmly by the trainees, authorities o b s e I've d yesterday. 'There is no dance scheduled for this Saturday night. However, prep- arations are being made to continue the series next Saturday evening. At press time of The Concordiensis no band had been chosen, although ,;arious local outfits were being t1uditioned. The organ recitals of Duncan Trotter Gillespie, presented every Sunday afternoon at 1600, are an· other form of recreation for the naval trainees sponsored by the uso. Last Sunday, Mr. Gillespie offered a program of eight selections, as- sisted by Nellie Varon Anderson, ::,oprano. Among the highlights of the afternoon's recital were Bach's \Toccata Adagio and Fugue, in C\ rendered by Mr. Gillespie, and the \Ave Maria\ by Bach-Gounod, offered by Miss Anderson, accom- r,anied by Mr. Gillespie at the con- sole. Trainees are cordially invited to attend these Sunday afternoon re- citals which are held in Memorial Chapel. -her APPLETON'S 136 JAY ST. Opp. Mohican Market \Does this mean that there is harder study at Union than in peace times? I think there is no question about it. Of course you can't quote me as saying that the boys study all the time. But it does look as though they use their smaller amount of leisure in othet· ways than reading. You might say \added Mr. Smith, \that our library of records is in tremendous de- mand: you know we have a very fine lot of recordings of all the bes·t music and these records can be borrowed like books. They are in constant circulation. We ought to have an allowance of at least $100 a semester to keep them up to date and meet this growing de- mand.\ Mrs. Helen E. Jenkins, Manager of the Book Store agrees that leisurely reading had declined on the campus probably because there is Jess leisure. She has discon- tinued the loan library of current fiction and other best sellers and will not start it again until there is a demand. \I am selling· fewer books than for a long time past, outside the realm of I•equired text books.\ The American Journal of Science for July 1943 contains an article entitled \A Contribution to Experi- mental Geology: The Origin of Eskers\ .by George F. Hanson, '43, who majo-red in Geology while at Union. Eeker is a term used by geologists for the narrow sinuous ridges of glacial sand and gravel. These eskers left by the recession of the glaciers of the ice age at·e I phenomena well known to geolo- gists and Mr. Hanson's study of I their origin is an important contri- bution to geological research and probably the first article from an undergraduate to appear in the American Journal of Science.
