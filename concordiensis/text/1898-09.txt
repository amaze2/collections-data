For the one hunclred and fourth time, '' Old Union\ threw open her gates last Tuesday to an incoming class, and at the present writing fifty- three new men have successfuUy passed their entrance examinations and are now daily being initiated into 'Hfe at Union and tts unique cus- 1 to1ns. The indications, however, point to a dass as large if not larger than last year. The1~e is no doubt that the class would have been an exceptionally large one, were it not for the war. Many who had 1nade application for entrance are now in Manila, Hawaii or in the carnps in the South, while others have been pre- vented from coming by the absence of fathers or brothers at the front. But though the class be smaU, it has already proven that what it lacks in numbers is n1ade up in spirit and enthusiasm. Tl1e three upper classes joi11 with The Con- cordiensis in welcoming the class of 1902, and our hope is that their connection with Union · 1nay not only be a source of gain for themselves but also a credit to the college.

Dr. Raymond addressed the stud.ents in the chapel on Sunday afternoon, taking as a subject \The Sabbath and the Sanctuary.\ He said that the same law which caused men to institute academies of art and music and to put the busi- ness houses of a city in one quarter, made them build sanctuaries. The worki11g of this law is to be found in all history. While God is not confined within fonr walls yet man's nature re- quires the setting aside of a definite place and time for worship. The only way to become independent of rules is to make confo1·mity to then1 a second nature. And for college men, a practical application of this line of thought would be uniting themselves with a city church and affiliating thetnselves with the Young Men's Christian association of the college. Two '98 men are now occupying positions on New York papers, P. P. Sheehan on the Mail and Express and W. D. Reed on the New York Herald.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. presideQt F(aymoqd's Uleleome. Thursday, September r5th, the first college exercises were held. After the usual opening prayer and hymn, the president delivered his custotnary address of welcome, together with some good words of advice to the undergraduates and the entering men. After reviewing some of the principal events which had happened during the past sutnmer, Dr. Raymond ex- pressed his belief that the Spanish war ,couid have but one effect, that of broadening our minds and inducing us to look at things in a much wider sense than we had ever done before. He believed that the war would do much toward making the coming generation considerably more advanced in tnany ways. He said : ''We cannot take relatively as large a part in the service of our country if we do not strive more for the attaintnent of our purpose. College life is an environment in which much depends upon the student himself. There are intellectual, athletic, social, moral and religious influences. The man who best uses all these agencies gets the n1ost out of ~ollege. Throw yourselves into college life with all the enthusiasm you have. Enthusiasm is needed not only at the start but all through your course. Persistency is also demanded. You are here to get out of college all it can give you.\ At the conclusion of his speech Dr. Raymond announced the expected arrival of the troops that evening together with their intended review upon the campus and suggested that the students be on hand to give them a fitting reception. The initial college meeting of the year, held on Monday n1orning was a remarkable one in many ways and augurs well for that phase of college life the coming year. In the absence of President W. J. Smith of the senior class, H. J. Hinman, '99, presided and on taking the chair took occasion to talk about football. He told of the season's fine prospects and spoke especially of the fine material in the freshman class. The Athletic Board, he said, was ready to announce that if the students raised $7oo the football managem:ent could close the season with no deficit. Physical director Pollard then took the floor and after reiterating the forn1er speaker'b state- ment, called for subscriptions of $t5 and $Io. When $150 had been thus raised, individual subscriptions for smaller amounts were called for and the ,money just poured into the hands of the four class collectors. Then the fraternities voluntarily tnade subscriptions and with similar contributions from each class as a whole, the surn was swelled, and before the hour was up Prof. Pollard announced, amid a ·storm of applause, a sum total .of $714, distributed as follows: Class of '99, individually ................... $174 00 Class of '99 as a whole. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 00 1900~ individually .......................... 123 00 1900, as·a whole........... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 00 1901, individually. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .... . 1901, as a whole ........................... . 1902, individually ......................... . 1902, as a whole ........................... .

The freshman class meeting was held, accord- ing to custom, before the rush and at four o'clock they poured out of th~ \Lab\ near which they were met by the \ Bloody Sophs.\ After a pr.eliminary s1drmish in which a shower of salt and tomatoes played an irnportant part, the two classes 1nade a rush for the cane, and there ensued a boisterous scrimtnage for about twenty tninutes, when time was called and the hands on the cane counted. The result as announced by referee \ Bill \ Sn1ith was 1901 ....................... , ... nine hands. 1902 .......................... seven hands.

TB:E CONOORDIEN.SIS. 7 When athletics are mentioned in the fall the first branch thought of i:s football, as that is of most importance at thi:s time. The prospect for our team this year is very encouraging, as there is sharp cotnpetition for every position, . and the candidates are not only heavy men, but : experienced players as well. Ten or twelve new ~men have been out each afternoon and Prof. PoUard, who is again coaching t.~1e team, has been very busy getting them in shape. The schedule of gam:es is. well arranged and our men will line up against some good tean1s, the ~most itnportant of wbieh is Williatns. The outfit purchased for the linen is the ~most exten- sive in many years and special care has been taken to provide those articles which eliminate so far as possible the chance of mishap. This year there will be an opportunity for those who cannot make the 'varsity to get posi- tions on the '' scrub.,\ which will take some short trips. The ass.i:s:tant manager, C. H. McCuHoch, has arranged a schedule for the second team and it is expected that many men will be drawn out by this innovation. The track teatn has suffered fewer losses this year tban any other tearn, so with the help of new n'lateTial from r902, it will probably reach a higher standard than last year. Among the new tnen are some good runners, especially at the long distance. The annual fall tennis tournament will prob- ably be held next week artd, although the spring handi,cap tournament had to be given up because of the small number of entries, this will be a \' scratch'' one as usual. The courts are being put in good condition and every day a crowd can be seen up at the net getting in shape to try for the championship. Out on the links there are many ,enthusiastic players every afternoon and the closely cut and carefully rolled green certainly look invit- ing. Mo1·e interest than ever before seems to be shown in the game tl1is year by members of the faculty, and almost every day the president and '3everal professors are out perfecting them· selves in the use of the st~icks. fl)'.eetiQQ of tl}e fiatioiJal ~OllQeU of .Plt)i Beta l{appa. The National Council of the Phi Beta Kappa society held its sixth triennial session at Saratoga, Sept. 7· A resolution was passed to the effect \That it is inexpedient to grant a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa to any institution which ~does not grant in regular course the degree of A. B.\ A nega:tive vote was secured on the resolution, \That it is inexpedient to confine the member- ship in ,every chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa to graduates taking the degree of A. B. The fol- lowing officers were elected~: President, John A. DeRemer, Schenectady, N.Y.; vice-presi- dent, James C. Van Benschoten, Middletown, Conn. ; secretary, E. B. Parsons, Williamstown, Mass. New charters were granted to Boston University, University of California, College of Haverford,. Princeton University, St. Lawrence University, Wabash College, Vassar College and the University of Wisconsin. Senators were elected for six years as follows : J. A. DeRerner, Schenectady; T. E. Hancock, Albany; Samuel Hart, Hartford; T. W. Higginson, Cambridge; Seth Low, Joseph H. Choate and Hamilton W. Mabie, New York; F. A. March, Easton; J. C. Van Benschoten, Middletown, and H. E. Scudder, Boston. Gl}e Y. fn. ce. p. J1eceptioQ. The annual reception for the members of the freshman class was given last Friday evening at the residence of President Raytnond, under the auspices of the college Y. M. C. A. • Several of the metn bers from the senior class acted as a reception cotnrnittee and presented the new conlers to President Raymond . and Dean Ripton, who welcom.ed them in theh usually cordial tnanner. Nearly all the fresh- men weTe present and together with the upper classmen, members of the faculty and local clergymen made a very pleasant assemblage. The house was attractively decorated, and during the evening light refreshrnents were served in the dining room. A feature of the occasion was the singing of college songs.

Our aim is to boom \~Oid Union\ and reflect college , sentiment. 'lo this end we ask for the support of ' all. Rem.ember tba,t the paper belongs to the · coilege, not to the editors. THE flag of our country floating in graceful folds against the blue sky always thrills the soul with pa.tdotism. .At the outbreak of th:e war a new flag was hoisted over Men1orial Hall, but the wind and weather bave played such havoc with it, that only a few faded and tattered I'e.t:nnants remain. A new flag ought to be hoisted, and a subscription for the purpose would be quite apropos. ALTIIOUHH a large sum of money was subscribed for the football season at the college 1neeting :Mon- day morning, it muBt be remembered that only a small portion of tbe amount was paid in. The money is needed to get the team into proper shape for the opening games, and the students are urg€d to pay t11eir subscriptions as promptly as possible, so that the work of the team will in no way be impeded. EVERYTHING looks favorable for a successful football season. The fres1pnan class contains some first class material, and a sharp coinpetition is being made for every position on the tea111. But a good serub is needed on the carnpus every day to line up against the 'varsity. A g1·eat deal depends upon the practice games, and the better scrub the 'vat·sity has to stand up against the more proficient in the game the team will becorne. DURING the summer vacation a few of the college dorn1itories were thoroughly renovated and r€furnisbed through the kindness and gener~ osity of some friends of the college. The students appreciate a kindness like this, for the average student does not display much taste o~ spend much u1oney in furnishing a room. It is sur- prising how neat and home~like one of the dor- mitories can be n1ade with a little ingenuity and new :ftu·nishings. The Concordiensis cannot let such a generous act pass unnoticed.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. HOME AJGAIN. The· :Returning Soldie:rs ~eceive a Hearty Welc()me. Never before in the history of the college has such a concourse .of people assembled on the campus as gathered there on 'Thursday evening, . September r 5, to participa.. te in the '' Welcome Home,\ extended to the Schenectady Volunteer co.mpanies of the znd r·egin<tent. The soldiers were n1:et at the depot by the local societies and fire companies in unifonn and escorted by them to the college grounds, where the exercises of welcome were held on the knoll at the west en:tra.J.ilCe to Nott memorial hall. Wl~ile the procession was en route, the soldiers were enthusiastically cheered, and Greek fire, cannon crac~ers and the ringing of bells proclaimed what the heart could not. The cam pus was well :lighted by two large arc lamps and a large bon-fire which the col- lege boys had made on tbe Terrace. The progra1n was as f()llows : Prayer, Dr. Raymond ; singing, \Stal\ Sprangled Banner\ ; address of welcotne, Mayor C. C. Duryee ; re- sponse, Major A. A. Yates; singing, \America\; benediction, Rev. J ohQ L. Reilly. Major Yates made an enthusiastic and vigor- ous l\esponse and was c:l1eered to the echo by his soldiers as he arose to speak. After the exercises the procession marched to the Centre Street Opera. :bouse, :where the boys enjoyed a supper prepal'ed by the ladies of the city. . Frank F. 1\hon1pson tb:e instructor in physics will becon1e a 1nembe:r of the University of . Maryland's faculty. A number of in1portant ~changes in the college · faculty have been made since last June. The instructor in modern la:.r.guages, Dr. Kenneth McKenzie, goes to supply a vacancy in the University of West Virg:i:nia. Loren C. Guern- sey, '95, will take Dr. McKenzie's place. The other change is in the library, Peter Nelson,, '98, succeeding G-. Briggs Lynes, '95, as acting librarian. Benjamin F. Bailey, a graduate of, and instructor in, the University oi Michigan will succeed Instructor Edgar B. Kay, who has been given supervision of a new special department of descriptiv:e geometry vvhi:ch has been created at CorRell. Prof. J atnes H. Stoller has returned to Union this fall after a year''s a.bsenee on the continent. During the greater part of his stay he was engaged in original research work, and short! y before his return the University of Leipsic gave him the degree of D~cto~· of Philosophy. Dr. A. A. Tyler, who was th~e instructor in Biology during Dr. Stoller's absence, has taken a sin1ilar position in Syracuse university. The vacancy caused by the resignation of Dr. Byron B. Brackett,. instructor in electrical en- gineering and thennodynarnies, will be filled by Mr. H. T. Eddy, a graduate of Rose Polytechnic Institute, and the University of Minnesota, who has been connected -w iith the General Elec- tric wo1·ks for the past year. E. P. North, '56, 1s prominently mentioned as candidate on the Republican ticket for state . eng1neer. The Cooperstown Freen1an.'s Journal is advo- cating the nominati<HJ: of ex-Judge Robert Earl, of Herkin1er, for governor on the Detnocratic ticket. Concerning his age, it says: ''True, he is an old tnan, but one in good health and with a cle~n- and well-balanced mind. He is not much older than was Satnuel J. Til- den when he beca lne Governor of the State ; nor much older than was Lucius Robinson when he was chosen Gov:ernor ; no older than was Levi P. Morton when he was elected Governor. There is any amount of executive work left in Robert Earl, if caHed into use. He sustained the regular Detnocraiic no1ninations in 1896.\ ..

The Collcordiellsis VoL. XXII. UNION COLLEGE, SEPTEMBER 30, 1898. N~o. 2. Foreeast iQ Football. The football tea1n is now approaching excel- lent condition under the able supervision of Prof .. Pollard. Captain Smith ha~ his n1en on the campus promptly at four o'clock every after- noon and a good delegation of spectators are present to encourage the players. The second eleven is a strong one this year and forces the 'varsity to work hard for every gain. Although the work of the teatn is. very encouraging the average weight will be light, probably not over · 155 pounds, but with hard constant training, the managetuent hopes to considerably overcon1e this difficulty. The cotnpetition for positions is very active. The entering class has brought to the college a considerable amount of good material, among whorn tnay be 1nentioned Thebo, Gulnac, Best, Dunning, H. A. Dyckman, E. F. Dyckman, Finnigan, Snell, Hawkes, Yawger, Woolworth, Shaw, Griffith, Ostrander and Metzger. Among the o]d men who are out trying for positions a1·e Fenton, Paige, Carver, Robinson, Jones, Weed, Brown, Ean1es, Greene, vVillis, Mallery, Strong and Schmitter. Gulnac will probably be full back, as he has had plenty of experience on different Bing- hanl.ton teams. Captain \Bill\ Smith, of course, will fill his old position at quarter. The candidates for the other positions are as follows: Half backs, Mallery, Dunning and 1\'hebo ; ends, Brown, Slack and Paige; center, l-I. A. Dyckn1an; tackles, Carver, Woolworth, Fenton and Metzger; guards, Shaw, E. F. Dyckman, Finnigan and Schmitter. These positions are, of course, all consider- ably in doubt and no one can tell at present who will be on the 'varsity when Union lines up against St. Stephen's college on the campus to- day (Saturday). The New Jersey athletic club has cancelled the game which was to have been played with the,m on October 8. Manager Hinman, is trying to arrange a date with New York utiliversity in New York city some time during the latter part of Nove,mber. The following is the schedule as it stands at present : October I, St. Stephen's college, on the campus. October 12, Williams college, at Williams- town. October 15, Stephens institute, on the can1pus. October 19, Tufts college, at Albany. October 26, Hobart college, on the 'Catnpus. October 29, Rutgers college, at A1bany. November 5, Hatnilton college, at Clinton. Novetnber I 2, Colgate university, at Hamil .. ton. November :z.6, Laureate boat club, on the catnpus. '8eQiors Eleet Offieers. The annual election of the class of '99 took place in the chapel last Friday afternoon. There were two tickets in the fief d and the election was a close one throughout. The office of president of the class went to Leroy T. Brad- ford of Broadalbin, whose brother,- Ralph Brad- ford, was president of '98 during his senior year. The other officers elected were : Vice presi- dent, Geo1·ge A. Doran, Amsterdam ;· secretary, Harrison K. Wright, Pulaski ; treasurer, Ferdi- nand Schmitter, Albany;. toastmaster, James N.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. The prospects for all of the clubs this year are very encouraging- as most of }ast year's musicians are again trying for positions and many men , from 1902 are als() competing. A trip to New York is again an assured thing and will proba bl. y be taken during the Easter vacation. Several others are now being mapped out, one to Buffalo and the cities of western New York for December., and another to Bing- harnton and the southern part of the state. The date for the latter has not been decided upon, but it will probably be made during one of the shorter vacations. The candidates for the Mandolin and Guitar club are : Eames, Heermance, Yates, South, Mark, Pollard, Stiles, Bullard, Hubbard, Pike, Stewart, Y awger and Weed; those competing for the Banjo club are: Stewart, Bender, Yates, Heermance, Yawger, Bullard, Bennett and Pike; and the contestants for places on the Glee club : W eecl, Greene, Pollard, E;:unes, Hayes, Keenes, A.
