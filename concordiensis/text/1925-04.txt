A 1-arge audience .composed of under- graduates, faculty members and friends of the college packed the bleachers in the gymnasium which were arranged on the four sides of the mat in the center of the floor. The Union Col- lege band rendered a program prior to the opening of the competitions. Director Harold A.

Womack Track men reported to Coach Har- old Aason Bruce Wednesday after• noon for th.e first day of practice .for the spring season. A squacl of 65 men put in appea·rancc which is small con- sidering the heavy schedule. Coach Bruce talked to the men on the coming season with the three dual meets ancl the two championships, the Penn Relays and the ~Iidclle Atlantic States' Intercollegiates. He outliaed training rules and the times for prac- tice. The Penn Relays are but 14 practice days away and during this time Coach Bruce must develofl a formidable one mile relay team. The relays are a two day affair, occurring on :\pril 24 and 25. The goal set is the ~fiddle Atlantic States' title and a win in every dual meet. Last year Union came in third in Class B colleges in the .:'.Iicldle At- lantic's. This year the Garnet is en- tered in class A. Practice will be held every day from 2:30 till 6:30 o'clock and for men who are unable to make these connections a private schedule will 'be arranged . During the Easter recess the team will be excused on Good Friday and will return Monday, April 13. 1926 GARNET WILL HAVE MANY CHANGES With all the material necessary for the publication of the 1926 Garnet now in the hands of the board, it is expect- ed that the book will be sent to the publishers within the next week. All the individual cuts and group pictures have been taken, all write-ups have •been handed in, and the art work has been completed. While there will be several innova- tions in this year's book, most conspic- uous among the changes will be that of the feature section. The present board is of the o:pinion that this sec- tion has not, in the past, been in keep- ing with the harmony and spirit of the publication and as a result a radi- cal change will be made here. Editor- in-chief ] ames A. Cameron has ind~­ cated that the book will be of in- creased interest to the student body this year because of the numeroqs new additions to the general makeup which have been introduced and also because of the prominence of original matter. The cover will be considera•bly dif- ferent from that of last year, in that stiff board will be used instead of semi-limp co:v:ers. The color has been definitely decided as blaok, with let- tering done in gold. The college seaJ will be placed exactly in the center of the page. All the art work is planned after a uniform style and every page will have ah original design. Another noticeable change will be found in the makeup accompanying the juniors' pictures. There will be no per-sonal writeups but simply a record of the student's college activities.

Year after year, plucky explorers try to climb Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, 29,141 feet high. With a G-E supercharger feeding air at sea- level pressure to the engine, an airplane pilot can go far higher. Lieut. Macready has reached 34,509 feet over Dayton, Ohio. He wou1d have soared over Mount Everest with more than a mile to spare! The tasks attempted for centuries in almost every form of hutnan ·endeavor have been conquered with the aid of electricity, with more than a mile to spare. The impossible today will be accomplished by men and women now in college. The scientist and engineer are doing their share.

If, the fraternities caunut conduct their' initiations without interfering with at- tendance at classes, then it is time for reg.ulation from a higher power, unde- · sirable as it may appear. There should also be a college rule prohi·biting the initiation of a freshman· into a fraternity until he has ·completed . a full semester at Union and has main- tained a scholastic average high' e11.ough to meet the general eligjbility rules.

Gone, with the ap- pearance of this obook, is the dangerous worship. at the shrine of the scholiasts, the takers of notes alone. Mind you, I commend the taking of notes. An excellent practise, without which, for all but your genius, hothing. Some- thing however, must be added to the notes, as The Concordiensis so well suggested in a recent editorial. That such an· o'bvious truth should need to be rehashed at all,-0, lago, the pity of it! Nevertheless, if one must rehash, let it be in the manner of Mr. Bacon, aptly styled by a recent reviewer, Pro- fessor Byron. Mr. Bacon is a profes- sor, but one with a considerable ap- proximation to the gifts of that poet whom the British place in the Peanut Gallery, but whom Continental Europe honors with a front row seat in the has the narrative gift in poetry, and is rather more direct in his story-telling power than was Byron, always except- ing that masterpiece, The Prisoner of ·Chillon. Secondly, even though he writes of graduate schools, Mr. Bacon displays a good deal of Byron's roman- tic power of moving the reader emo- tionally. The second of the two poems is the better in this respect, despite the difficulty inherent not merely in its scene, but also in the author's boasted avoidance of a heroine. Thirdly, Mr. Bacon has something, even, of Byron's larger mind, .as revealed l.n philoso- phical side comments here and there. And, finally, in my opinion he has all of Byron's wit. Mr. Bacon is not, at any rate as yet, a lyric poet, in the sense of mastery of hnage and sound. Unexpectedly at. times, however, appear fine lines such as \The ghost of shame and shadow of disgrace/' More frequently, he deftly lifts the. lines .of other poets for insertion in. his own verse. He does not hope of course, that the reader will be deceived. He speaks merely as one man of cul- ture to another, without the insult of quotation marks. I shall not give away the plots of the poems contained in this book. I could not promise to most freshmen ~my particular pleasure in the reading of them. But that the unorthodox:, more mature browser in literature will not be able to lay down the book, once started, I stake my reputation. R. W.

Geology Instructor Attends Convention 1 Edward S. Smith, instructor in the department of geology, went to Syra- cuse on March 27 to attend a pre- liminary meeting of the memlbers of the geological departments of a num- ber of colleges in this part of the state with the view of organizing an annual field execursion, participated in! by the instructors and advance stu- dents in geology. These excursions, undertaken by the I colleges, would be to well-known lo- calities and would be led by the various I members who had worked in, and had, I a thorough knowled.ge of, these sec- i tions. Attending the preliminary con-i ference were representatives of Syra-' cuse university, Hamilton college, Col- gate university, Union College, and the University of Rochester. Beside the.3e colleges it is expected that Cornell and: 'St. Lawrence universities and other, colleges will co-operate. ! For this season Professor Dale of I Hamilton is the field director and Pro- 1 fessor Harry N. Eaton is general sec- j retary. The tentative dates for the, spring excursion are May 15 and 16. , The plans are to visit the old iron mines at Clinton, N. Y. 1 and on Satur-' day, to proceed to Little Falls ; where the pre-Cambrian contact is to 1 be studied. The excursions <Will >be helpful .to the students of the subject since they wiJll afford .original observation supple- t menting class work.

I Goods, Aut:o :Supplies element of strength. I \h possesses intrinsic attractiveness; 1 ================================== it has definiteness; granting its presup- positions it is reasonably coherent; ! the pIan of salvation is such as can be~ understood by the plain man; it has!· the appeal of antiquity; it is supported • by sentiment; it offers certainty to the.· doubter; it lays enough emphasis up-: on the miraculous to satisfy the aver- i age human being's craving for the, ntysterious. Fundamentalism is power- ful. It is not a movement that in our · •blind confidence in universal educa- tion we can ignore. And it is not at 1 all certain that in the struggle now\ going on between religious funda- i mentalism and religious l~beralism the: latter will win.\ I Dr. Chidsey was of the opinion that! religion could be defined, stating that the burden of proof rested upon himl who would claim that religion is inde- 1 finable, as it would be necessary to prove all definitions inadequate or self-j contradictory. He then discussed the 1 more important definitions and showed! that they were either too inadequate or i too inclusive. Dr. Chidsey defined 1 religion as \a mode of human behavior: through which men seek to establish a• relation for their own good or the good of their fellows, with superhuman spiri-: tual )lower or powers. He character-, ized the scientist as the foe of religion' \not by acknowledging the truth of: science but by adopting the present! day attitude of science. This attitude; is one in which the seeker after truth: approaches the world after first having! made certain fundamental assump-! tions.\ These assumptions, Dr. Chid-~ sey said, were that all knowledge must 1 be founded on fact; that all facts are; sense facts; that truth ought and can 1 be cleared of the taint of subjectivism; I that all facts are subject to causal re- lations, which is the assumption ofl determination; that knowledge may be completely unified, called by philoso- phers the speculative dogma. Dr. Chidsey upheld the belief in the supernatural not as the fundamental- ist's naive faith in the miraculous but as something that the most sophista- ·cated may hold unashamed. This supernaturalis'm asserts that all reality • is not sensuous and consequently that all know ledge is not sci: en tific. \The true liberal is the man who is free from all superstitions, be they religious or scientific. He will recog- nize that the universe is much larger than that recognized by science, and that it is full of a number of things that 'Eye hath not seen nor ear ever heard.' Such a liberal is a true friend of religion, and between his liberalism and his religion there never need be any conflict, because both make room for · that which is a,bo:Ve nature, the super-. natural.\ Famous Yells DO~fT -STOP'!r Now isn't that just like a woman!

Garnet Goes to Press The 1926 Garnet was sent to press Saturday morning. Although all the necessary material is now in tpe hands of the publishers, it is not expected that the year book will be ready for distri- bution at the usual time. This is ac- counted for by several photographic troubles which have arisen, and also because of the change in the staff after the midyear examinations. Unless something unforseen arises, however, the book will be distri'buted sometime before commencement. The Garnet this year· is .being printed by the Argus Publishing company, of Albany.

Letters of, congratulations to ex-editor Henrietta 1 Perkins and condemnation of Dean Lord's stan<\ have come m from all1 directions. Alice Stone Blackwell, author and journalist, for many years a trustee of: Boston University, declared that she • did not know that compulsory military I training existed at Boston University.: \I do not see that it is a necessary . corollary for business training,\ she added. I H. Swanson, editor of College Humor, :Max Brammer, editor of thei Yagabon<l, l'niversity of Indiana, and! I Edward Keating, editor of Labor, a 1 national weekly owned by the railway! brotherhoods, sent letters of congratu-i lation to the deposed Beanpot editor. ! Dr. Mary Lakeman of the state· department of health wrote: I want\ to say to you that a few at least among (lltr graduates look with great disfavor' upon your requested resignation be-l cause of having taken a stand for peace in the world. I presume you are 1 well aware that the acting president' of the University, Bishop Anderson,; is an avowed pacifist, speaking publicly 1 for peace. . 1 Searching criticism was unsparmgly 1 dealt the Dean in letters :both to him' U . .

The result was an exodus of students and faculty. That college lost some of the best teachers in the country and the student body was reduced to one third of its former number.\ Among the letters to Bishop Ander-~ son, president of the university, is one from Mrs. Martha Helen Elliot, presi-~ dent of the \iV omen's lnternational league for peace and freedom. A quo- tation from her letter follows: \As criticisms of the United States Senate are quite common in the press. I and from the public ·platform, I wonder! why a student is to be penalized ap- parently with the consent of the dean, 1 for writing in fun of an army division 1 training in the .university.

Plans for the coming season were outlined. 1 Coach Le'ary left today, so Captain Richard Laughlin will be in charge of the early practice, which began to- day and will continue for two and one half weeks. This practice, which is for all men not now out for other athletics, will consist mainly of pass- ing the ball around and limbering up. Regular practice will begin on Sep- tember 4. Press Club Officers Are Elected For Year At the annual election meeting of the Press Club, held last night in the gymnasium office, Russell B. West on was elected president for the 1925-26 year. Herman G. Maser, '26, was elected vice .president. Charles E. Stewart, '27, was re-elected secretary, and Cecil S. Mapes, '26 was elected business manager. In a short address, Weston outlined the probable policy of the clu'b for the coming year. It is expected that more special news stories will be sent out besides the regular sport and personal· items. A reorganization of the club will take place in the near future and the appointment of the new department heads will take place at the regular · ((Towering Masses\ The Garment Center B11ildings New York City WALTER M.
