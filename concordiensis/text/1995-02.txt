However, the political science department has recent.Jy been weathering some serious transitions. Department Chair, Byron Nichols, confinned that professors Paula Consolini, and Theresa Marchant Shapiro will not be retuming to Union next Fall. In addition, Professor Donald Thurston will be retir- ing. It remains to be detennined if visiting profes- sors Ali Abootalebi and Richard Fox will be retum- mg. What's Happenfng on Campus? TI1ree new faces will join the political science department next year, TI1eodore Gillman, a special- ist in East Asian politics will be replacing Profes- sor Donald Thurston. He will be teaching both In- ternational and Comparative Politics classes. Gillman was described by Nichols as. '\one of the top people on the market this year.\ A second pro- fessor, who will be a specialist in congressional and legislative politics, will be hired to replace Profes- sor Charles Tidmarch. In addition, James Underwood will be retuming to the department this fall after serving seven years as Vice President of Academics at Union and one year on sabbatical. Student Activities, OCS, are Making Schedules More Accessible by Elizabeth DeKoven · Associate News Editor Following last week's Crosstalk that focused on turning off the taps on cam- pus, Director of Student Activities, Lee Bloomrosen, vowed to correct students view that there is \nothing to do at Union.\ Bloomrosen corrected students by saying, ''It is not that there is noth- ing to do at Union, it is that there is not enough time to do everything and people don't know where to look.\ h1 Bloomrosen's five year~ at Union College, he has attempted to improve the communication network between the student body and the Student Ac- tivities Office. Currently, the paths of communication that the Student's Ac- tivities Office have opened to the stu- dent body are the central infoilmition board located in the College Center, the electronic ticker and the campus wide infonnation system on the Gopher, The central infonnation board is lo- cated where the Dutch Delights used to be. It is organized by subject and is updated on a regular basis. The electronic ticker is above the central information board and updates the campus on thajor speakers, entertain- ers and movies. The most exciting path of commu- nication that is open to the students is the computerized infonnation system on the Gopher, t11e computer system that was designed at the University of Maryland to provide a vast menu based system of information. The calendar of events is located in the Campus Gopher under Student Activi- ties Organizations and Government. The news file contains up to date ma- terial on special events; like additi0nal elections and major events like Crosstalks, movies, concerts, and clubs. The new comput'er system drasti- cally cuts back on the fliers and phone calls that the approximately 80 cam- pus organizations make conceming upcoming events. TI1e campus cal- endar on the Gopher system is an \of- fice of events\ according to Bloomrosen, it is updated daily and is readily available in all donn rooms. To enter the system, all students have to do is enter GOPHER at the $ on their computer. Other places that stu- dents are capable of accessing the in- fonnation is the VAX in the lobby of the College Center and the computer center. \Publicity is 70% of any battle,'' In regards to the hiring of Professor Gillman, the East Asian studies specialist, it should be noted that their was some debate within the depat1ment prior to his appointment. 1l1e debate was raised over the issue of selecting either an East Asian specialist or a Middle Eastern specialist to fill the vacancy cre- ated by Professor Thurston's retirement. Nichols provided the following explanation for the decision that was made by the department collectively in the Fall of 1993 to hire an East Asian Studies specialist over a Middle Eastem studies specialist; \The de- partment expressed a unanimous feeling to hire a specialist in East Asia rather than a Middle Eastem specialist. This decision was based on the nature of the world, the United States' position in the world, and the college curriculum.\ When asked if he has since changed his opinion on this issue considering the political changes in the Middle East within the past two years, Professor Nichols stated, \I have no Continued 011 page 4 Continued 011 page 4 Campus Ministry Receives $25K to Further Religious Programs by Jody Mousseau Concordiensis Staff Campus mii1istry has not been one of the top priorities of many Union students.

This year, a $25,000 grant has been given to the Union Protes- tantCampus Ministry by the Lou- isville mstitute for the study of Protestantism and American Cul- ture, to help enlighten people of the problem and to revive stu~ dents to campus ministry. Former Protestant Chaplain, Hugh Nevin, sought the grant as a result ofthree events which oc- curred in 1993 and 1994. In Al- bany, a conference was held con- cerning the importance of minis- try in higher education. After the question was raised, a forum of twenty people from across the country gathered to discuss the book by Douglas Sloan entitled Faith and Knowledge: Mainline Protestantism and 20th Century HigherEduc:ation. Recently, an- other book; Inquiring and Dis- cerning Hearts, has been scruti- nized to investigate campus min- istry. The last event which setved as a catalyst for further action and investigation into the situation was the installment of many new chaplains at local area colleges and universities, including RPI, SUNY Albany, and Skidmore. ·The question that arose from the series of events was, \What is Campus ministry about?\ With the constant changing of society and culture, the relation- ship between the Church and uni- versity is constantly changing. Newly appointed Union Prates- tant chaplain, Rev. Kathleen Buckley, has placed the crusade as one of her top priorities. Three phases to the revival of campus ministry on university campuses have been planned. The first is in the analysis of the two books previously mentioned. Eight to ten people meet monthly to dis- cuss their importance, consider- ing that they are two of the few books that deal with the impor- tance of campus ministry. ll1e second is a planned conference to be held on the Union campus between November 30 and De- cember 2, 1995. The speakers will include the authors of the mentioned books. The third phase of the program, will be the establishment of a campus study group. With the cooperation of Roman Catholic chaplain, Tom Freeburg, and Rev. Buckley, they will search for the answer to the question, \What makes Union tick?\ Currently, the Protestant Cam- pus Ministry activities include a Sunday evening informal wor- ship service each week as well as an 8am Wednesday moming prayer. More activities are be- ing planned. Perhaps in the near future, the program will make a significant impact on the Union campus. Rev. Kathleen Buckley stated, \l think the goal is to develop a new vision for campus ministry and the relationship of the Church and the academy.\

NEWS February 2, 1995, page 3 Turning Off the Taps: Should Union Go Dry? by Heather Manley Associate News Editor Union College students, faculty, staff and administration gathered last Wedi1esday for the latest Crossta,lk entitled, \Absolut Union: Is it Time to Tum Offthe Tap?\ Glen Konopaske, class of '95,. moderated a panel consisting of two students and two profes- sors. Jm1athan Wintsch, class of '95, and Professor Linda Patrik of the philosophy department both agreed on the dangers of alcohol, but Patrik argued that Un·ion should become a dry campus. Pro- fessor Anton Warde of the mod- enllanguages department and Lisa Schneider, class of '95, argued that Union should maintain the status quo. Wintsch opened the discussion by citing a recent study from Harvard University regarding binge drinking. The study, pub- lished in the Journal of the Ameri- can Medical Association, found that 50% of men and 39% of women on college campuses are binge drinkers. Binge drinking is defined as consuming five or more drinks in one sitting, for men, and consuming four or more for women. He said that these results are similar to a study done at Union by a Student Assessment Group. According to the Union study, fifty-five percent of the stu- dents are unhappy that the social atmosphere focuses on drinking. At the same time, Wintsch noted that other campuses with Greek systems do not always agree. Patrik elaborated on this issue. First, she explained that once a person has a habit, it is hard to break it unless it is substituted by something better. \Students at Uni.on must find something bet- ter than drinking,.\ said Patrik Se.cond; she stated the Harvard study shows the effects of poor ~ academic performance, an in- ·~ crease in violence toward women ~ and long range physical effects. ~ Patrik also added that she under- t stood the social atrnosphere at ~ Union because ofher own expe- ~· rience with alcohol and drugs ;; while at graduate school. ~ On behalf of the opposing ar- ~ gument, Schneider agreed that a ~· dry campus is not the answer. :;;· She also stressed the need for Lisa Schneider, Linda Patrik, Jonatlzan Wintsc/1, Gle11 Konopaske were tile panelists at tile Crosstalk. social alternatives. Schneider said that a prohibition ofalcohol on campus would force students to go off campus and get into cars, increasing the possibility for drinking and driving. \Tuming study on binge drinking and its effects. Warde's point was that while it is hard to argue that this type ofbehavior damages educa- tion, turning off the taps will take \Turning taps· off won't end drinking. It will only relocate it.\ taps off won't end drinking. It will only relocate it,\ she said. Warde argued that this is not the time to turn off the taps. However, he acknowledged the away the opportunity to grow morally and \make better choices while the taps are flowing.\ Warde also said, \We only de- velop morally when we have an attraction and not a prohibition not to.\ After the conclusion of the panel discussion, members of the audi- ence had a chance to voice their opinions. Some mentioned the concern they had for the abuse of alcohol by underage drinkers. Oth- ers mentioned the need for more alternatives to drinking. Wintsch noted that other schools with ex- tensive Greek systems have more things to do and therefore do not have the problems that Union faces. Lee Bloomrosen, Director of Student Activities, retorted that the school has between fifty and eighty clubs that create so- cial altematives to drinking. He understands that it is hard to make the decision to go to the alternative event and not just drink. In the end, the Crosstalk reached no compromise. While all parties admitted that the sta- tistics of the Harvard study are strutling, it does not seem like the taps at Union will tum off in the near future. Union Celebrates Indian Culture FRESHMEN SOPHOMORES JUNIORS by Nalini Gupta Concordiensis Staff In an innovative effot1 to foster a better understanding of the In- dian subcontinent within the Union College cmmnunity, the members of the Indian Student Union.

'I 'I·. February 2, 1995, page 4 NEWS Union Students Make Their Mark in China by- Adrian MacLean Concordiensis Staff Ben Miller, a sophomore, and Jake Dolce, a senior, returned from their tenn abroad with an award :md an appearance on Chi- . nese Television. After one tenn of Chinese hist spring, Miller and Dolce con- front~d.the fear of being far from home and adventuring in the un- familiar. Miller was awarded the prize for outstanding performance in beginning Chinese. Out of200 hundred foreigners and few Americans he was given a Chi- nese dictionary. \He excelled in Chinese as the highest ofthe group;\ said Dolce. Dolce was offered an appear- atlee on Nanjing TV to sing a popular Chinese song. He learned the song at a karaoke bar and was humming the tune in the restau- rant where he had an internship. The cooks wrote the song down for him and Dolce san'g it through the trip. A girl from Germany it1troduced Dolce to some admin- istrators and he was asked to per- fonn in the Foreig11 Student Tal- ent Show. \It was really great because the ne:xt day even the post man knew about the show,\ said Dolce. The trip began in Shanghai where the group had a three day orientation. There were nine stu- dents in total which made it nec- essary for the group to work to- gether. They made fdends that probably would never have formed at Union. \At first I thought, 'what am I doing here?' If 1 ha:d stayed at Union I wouldn't have made the friends that I did,\ said Miller. \The small group is good be- cause you can do a lot together. You can bring that home with yoll,\ said Dolce. Their program was in Nanjing and consisted of two classes in Chinese and an independent study or cultural experience class. Dolce took painting and cooking while Miller studied acupuncture. The term was intimidating at first, but the experiences shared made it exciting. Both Dolce and Miller felt that the term went too quickly.

To leave af- ter tliree months you realize how fast time goes by,\ said Dolce. According to Dolce and Miller the learning oocurted outside the classroom. They i.ived in a for- eign dorm and the common ,Jan- guage was Chinese. In order for them to communicate with some- one from Germany or Korea they had to learn the Chinese. There weren't any Americans, and they were surrounded by stu- dents that k11ew three or four lan- guages. English is such a com- mon language, but often times that was not one of the many other stu- dents knew. The people that they met were very cordial and friendly. At no time on their tlip did either of them feel unsafe. Miller felt that in or- der to learn you had to be out go- ing and accepting. One time a man came up to him and began rubbing his arm; the man had never seen hairy a,nns. The Chinese were curious about the outsiders. They were eager to learn about them and when they saw· the' big guy in Dolce and the red hair of Miller, eyes followed them for miles. Each student had their own ex- perienoe and ex.plored the land. Dolce visited Hong Kong, Su2:hou afid Beijing. Miller took a boat down the Grand Canal in Suzhou. A few of their main at- tractions were th~ Fotbiaden City, Tienamen Square, the tomb of Mao and the Great Wall. \When I was in Tienamen Square I could feel my body full of goose bumps,\ .said Dolce. Unfortunately, only four stu- dents are currently signed up for next years term in China. The program could be terminated due to a lack of participants. Accord- ing to Miller and Dolce many people are intimidated by the dis- tance. It has become a tradition and their hosts are excited for the next group to come. \ltwould be a shame for us to be the last group to go,\ said Dolce. · Recommended Reading Lists Show That C;lassics Are Still In (NSNS) - A recent major study of vocabulary and reading materials required of highschool and first-year college ·students shows that verbal expressions have changed dramatically, but literary masterpieces have remained much the same over the past half-century. appeared about seven 1;imes per million wOFd last year. Other. words such as· \blithe\ decreased in use since 1944, from seven words per million words to only three worlds per million last year. The works most recommended for reading by young peeple today are; in descending.order, The Scarlet Letter, Huckleberry Finn, The Great Gats by, Lord r~f the Flies, Great Expectations and Hamlet. Students today still are strongly encouraged to read the classics by Twain, Shakespeare and Hemmingway, but the words that young people use themselves have shifted greatly since 1944, according to a report by the College Board. The College Board Vocabulary Study is reportedly the larg~st undertaking of its kind since 1944. The new study was based on a comprehensive compilation of reading materials from curriculum surveys and guides, federal reports and recommended reading lists. For instance, last year students use~ the world \environment'' 73 times per one million words, compared to just 14 times per million words in 1944. Similarly, worlds such as \ecology \racism .and \telecommunications\ were not used at all in the 1940s, but • - NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEA!-TH HEALTH RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM 34G Broadway, Room 712 ~ New York, N.V.10013 Telephone: (:?12) •142·3380 'TRAINEESHII'S IN PUBLIC HEALTH SUMMER !995 flw flcnl!h Rcsrnrch lrnlnin~ Jlrognim nnnouncrs th\ Summer J9!)5~;~h:m of the Program.

February 2, 1995, page 6 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY A Cholesterol Reducing Drug by Kenny Lee Co S& T Editor Over the past ten years, one of the major '\buzz words\ in health has been cholesterol. Both the young and the old worry about their c.holesterol level, and periodic cholesterol tests are fatal heart attacks by 40%, while not producing the previously observed adverse side effects. TI1e study consisted of 4400 patients from northem Europe observed for a median of 5A years. The importantpru1 of the observation was not only the fact that heart-related placebo was.30% less. The new cholesterol lowering drug, simvastatin, is a member of a class of cholesterollo\.vering drugs that interferes with the actions of enzymes essential for chol estero! synthesis. Specifically, the enzyme that simvastatin blocks is vital for Parasympathetic Impulses along vagus 1 X l nerves highly suggested. However, what has been lacking is a method of treatment that involves drugs. Surgery and a change in diet have been the major ways to reduce cholesterol in recent years, with drug treatments taking a back seat. C'hyrne contau:ung partially digested proteins. tats. hypertonic Qr hypotomc fluids, or 1rr1 ta ting substances t the sequestering of cholesterol receptors. In other words, simvastati n leads to the increase of cholesterol receptors in the bloodstream which bind the fi·ee choleserol and eliminate its negative effects. The main reason that drug treatments have been overlooked is the fact that they have not yet been perfected. In fact many of the early cholesterol treating drugs had the side effects of causing cancer and increasing the suicide rate of patients. However there is a St1mcJ1ates secreuon of pancfeallc .JUICe rich in digestive enzymes J As is the case with all new research, the consumer must be wary of the new drugs. Presently, four of these enzyme inhibiting drugs are being marketed specifically for people with high choleterol levels. Another important fact that people in the field stress is that these drugs may not be for healthy people with normal cholesterol levels, because it has not yet been proven that new glimpse of hope in the research and medical worlds. A group of researchers in Norway have come up with a drug that reduces hospitalizations decreased, but that the mortality rate in the treated patients as compared to the patients who received lowering cholesterol levels prolonges the life of healthy people. Source: .'idence by Andy Salama CoS& T Editor One of the most predomit1ant diseases in the United States today is diabete~. Of the people who have diabetes, over a half a million depend on insulin supplements. Until recently, the solution for these patients was to use human insulin, mass produced from bacteria, as an injection. New research centers on the possibility of replacing the machinery that produces insulin in the human body. Insulin is produced in the pancreas, specifically in the Islets of Langerhans, where a deficiency in the beta cells causes a fonn of diabetes, called diabetes mellitus. Insulin is necessary for many bodily functions, most importantly, the decrease in blood sugar level. Insulin accomplishes this by accelerating transport of glucose into cells, where it is converted into glycogen. In addition, insulin increases lipogenesis and stimulates protein synthesis. As mentioned before, researchers are looking to replace the defective islet cells with new islet cells. l11e original thought was to use human islet cell, but human pancreases are in short supply. Tims new research is being done on pig islets cells. It has been reported that the human body can accep!pigtransplanted islet cells quite easily. In fact, many of the' nonnal preventions against rejection are t1ot needed. However, the transplanted cells are not producing enough insulin to counteract the diabetes in the patients. Therefore, the researchers are now working on increasing the yield. How is it that the human immune system does not immediately reject the pig islet cells? In fact in 60% of the patients in the study that is indeed what happened, but in the other 40% the cells survived for up to 14 months. The explanation for this is that unlike previous studies where pig blood vessels were present in the transplant, these transplants lacked them. It is well documented that pig blood vessels cause an almost immediate rejection. As the researchers approach the next step in their research they need to answer some hard questions. First. can these pig cells produce insulin in a great enough amount to compensate for the patients inability to prodttce the honnone? Second, can this research be integrated in the work to incorporate adult human islet cells, to produce viable human islet cell transplants?

February 2, 1995, page 8 LIVING When Cruel is Kind: Interview With a Puppet-Maker by Alex Shapiro Living Editor When Geppetto created Pinocchio, it was not his in- tended goal to bring a little wooden moral adventurer into the world. The puppet was bom still; it wasn't supposed to question the way things were, only to do a jig when its strings were pulled. When Pinocchio awoke, his initial moment of epiphany came with the shrill touch of a fairies wand. TI1e strings were broken, he did a jig ofhis own. Modem day puppet-makers use more sophisticated tools than did Geppetto; not high- power lathes and computerized jigsaws, but glossy presses and vibrating air waves. They sell to a more upscale market; today's puppeteers sit high in the sky behind mahogany and silver work stations. But regardless efthe shifts in industry, the shiny products being delivered today are in no way less innocuous ot servile than were those ofPinnocchio' s less active brethren. The puppets being made to- day are not made of wood, 11or are they made of plastic. l11e process of the puppet's birth has been dubiously subverted; todays puppets are born alive and then sculpted into respond- ing only to the tug of strings. ' / I, •:•_1 '1 'i .( What's your sign? Please, let'·s not worry so much about me. When did you realize you had this abil- ity to make puppets? Honestly, I began pretty yom1g. I would cry and my mother would bring the food, or. whatever, you know. l11en af- ter a while it became more dif- ficult to control people, and I really went crazy. Sitting around playing with cars and stuff, blah-blah. I had a twin brother though, and I noticed, whenever someone turned on the radio and Bootsy Collins was on, he'd start dancing .. It was with that realization that I joined the ranks. How did you develop your skill? I would practice on my brother and my friends at the time. Pauses. Coca-Cola? Back off! I mean, none for me, thank you. (Beneath his breath), tough cookie.

A Letter to the Administration To the editor: 1 am a sophomore at Union College and am currently ques- tioning the pride that I once took in the variety of opportunities of- fered by the admip.istration. A fairly recent situatien involving your tenn abroad policy seems to sacrifice the integrity and mission of this 'so-called' liberal institu- tion. Your goal for I 00% of stu- dents to take a Union tenn abroad is noble but not feasible, because all areas of study are not repre- sented. For instance, I am a ge- ology major and would like to take at least one course abroad to help complete my requirements, yet none are offered. By not of- fering geology through Union, I was forced to look elsewhere. As of Monday, December 11 , r seri- ously investigated the term abroad option to New Zealand for a full year, beginning this Febru- ary. l11e University of Otago in New Zealand approved of and encouraged my application with- out any reservation but based on Union's limit of 15 students for a non-Union tenns abroad, my ini- tiative was stifled and a fantastic opportunity was lost. Due to aca- demic requirements conceming my major, it would be impossible for me to take a tenn abroad next February. Obviously Union has no ultimate contr:ol in where I study, but they do bave power over accepting or ;denying accu- mulated ct:edits. My inconvenience is 11ot what bothers me, but it is the blatant· neglect for educational opportu- nities that is upsetting. l11is de- terrent to students taking non- Union terms directly opposes nearly every ideal in wi1ich this 'liberal' institution was seem- ingly founded. This, to me, indi- cates that the current administra- tive policy focuses more on the conservation of finance th<m the actual growth and development of the student body. 111is is per- fectly illustrated by the yearly desire by students to travel to New Zealand and Australia. with no option available through Union C::ollege. Understandably, the college must attempt to sta- bilize its own keel in the present ecot1omi c conditions, but the freedom of a students' education should not be sacrificed. I am thoroughly disappointed by the current policy and ask for a change or expansion of the tenn abroad program. This policy mirrors a fmgal and poorly fo- cused administration, which is quite disturbing to an educated student at your institution. Michael E. Bullen OP-ED .:·.·.·· ... : · .·.- .· · .. ··.·.· .. ·EDITORIAL . .. . ... ·. : The Realities of DivisiOn· I ' - ' ' - .. Four years ago, Union College became the sec- ond smallest college in the United States to support a Division I program, when the men's Ice Hockey team joined the Eastern College Athletic Conference. The decision to upgrade the program was difficult for the Union administration. Could Union main- tain its academic standards and build a successful Division I program without giving out athletic schol- arships? For the first three years of its existence, Union's tJpgraded program has been the pride of the Col- lege. Last year, the Dutchmen had a Cinderella sea- son, finishing sixth in the conference after a nine game unbeaten streak. Union's amazing turnaround after compiling a 6-43-1 record during their first two years, can be attributed to last year's amazing re- cmiting class. In order for Union to compete at the Division I level, Coach Delventhal realized that the program would have to attract high caliber junior hockey play- ers. Over the past few years, several Union players have been drafted or offered contracts to play minor · league hockey. Not until this week hasthe school been forced to deal with the prospects of one its stu- dents leaving College two and a half years before graduation in order to pursue a professional hockey career. Troy Stevens announced on Monday night that he would be leavii1g Union the next day to pursue his dream of reaching the NBL. The College is now feeling the costs of fielding a competitive team. While losing a student may not b'e a problem for a large institution, it does have a more significant impact on a school with only 2000 students. Certainly, the school does not want to be known as a minor league for professional hockey, where players leave school as soon as they receive attrac- tive professional contracts. The problem is exac ... erbated by Stevens' timing. By leaving Union in the middle of an academic tenn, it is clear that Stevens came to Union with the intent honing his hockey skills, and not with the inte1it of receiving a College education. While athh~tics are an important part of a· Col- lege education, they should never be a student's prhnary concem. That is, academics should never be an afterthought. As the Hockey Team becomes more compe_titive, these issues are sure to resur- face. While there is no irmtrediate solution to the problem, Coach Delventhal should meet with the Union administration to discuss whether the school is really interested in trying'to once again become a national powerhouse in hockey. In the mean- time, Delventhal should be congratulated for run- ning one of the cleanest Division I programs in the country. A Twenty-Five Year Study of Women at Union College: Surveying Our Past and Future To the editor: Not only is 1995 the bicenten- nial year of.Union College arid the !50th anniversary of engineering at the school, it is also the twenty-: fifth anniversary of coeducation at Union. For many of us it may seem hard to imagine that these classrooms once rang with only the sound of male voices, and that women were bussed in from nearby Skidmore College for so- cial functions. However, with another glance around campus at the smali number of full-time women faculty members and the freqttent sight of fratemity houses, single sex-education may not seem that far in the past. In 1984, Sociology Professor Martha Huggins' Sociological Methods and Research Class con- ducted a stttdy of the first gradu- ating class of women at Union, ten years after its graduation. This study, \Women at Upstate Col- lege: The First Ten Years\ (Union's name was replaced by \Upstate College\ to disguise the school's identity) disconcerted some with its eye-opening find- ings. Some women reported a lack in sufficient funding for ex- tra-curricular clubs and sports, having played on second-rate fields an.d in second-rate uni- fonns. Others cited the lack of social life for women, the domi- nation offratemities, and sexism on campus. One faculty mem- ber in the study compared the first female graduates' experiences to that of a '\revolving door\ \women were admitted, enrolled and passed through the college without sufficient facilities or support\. To commemorate the quarter- century anniversary of women at Union, Professor Huggins has decided to conduct a follow-up study of the original. The new study which is funded by the. Roger ll1ayer Stone Chair at1d Union's Internal Education Foun- dation, will focus on the 1974, 1984, and 1994 graduating . classes of women. Prof. Huggins and her research assistants- Beth Decker, Chris Freed. Susan Greenberg, Jennifer Hacker and Ahnya Mendes. will survey three decades of female graduates; from the \Pioneers\ to \Generation X\ to discover ,why they attended Union. their experiences at the college-- both academically and socially- and their lives since gtadua tion. The results from the study will be presented during the fall, 1995 weekend celebration of coeduca- tion at Union College. It will be fascinating to compare women's opinions throughout this twenty- five year period to see if much has changed here at Union: are women still being pushed through a \revolving door\ ot are women now receiving the same attention and encouragement that two hun- dred years of male !,'Taduates have received from Union College? Respectfully. Elizabeth Decker An Editorial Apology Editorials, Letters & Disclaimers We, the editors of The C oncordiensis, would like to apologize for some of the material that has appeared in this section recently. The editors of The Concordiensis are not vindictive people .. We do not abuse the power ofthe press to inflate our egos. We do not relish priniting negative material, though it is sometimes necessary to ruffle a few feathers on controversial issues. We do not assign writers to bash organizations, though we encourage all sorts of opinions (positive or negative) from the College community. When we have abused our power as student editors, community feedback is appreciated. Once these problems have been discussed at our staff meetings,' we attempt to rectifY them. Letters to the Editor should be addressed to the OP-ED Page and must be received br 4p.m .. the Monday before publication Letters must be less than 500 '' ords and should pertain to an issue that concerns the Union College community. Final Decisions concerning printing and/or editing a submission belong to the Editorial Board.

Some speculate that he's working for the New York Times, others believe that the he's been captured by terrorist space aliens. His roommate has pro- vided some insight into the mat- ter, \The last time I saw Tony, he was playing with three little green man.\ Of course, his roommate has also made 34 reports to cam- pus safety this year about UFO's, so his information is questionable at best. So, for those perceptive read- ers out there, I'll confirm what you already suspect: I don't have a clue about what I should write. I suppose in one sense this is a good thing because it also means I can't think of anytl1ing to com- plain about. It also means I prob- ably won't get any angry letters to the editor this week. Although I guess I shouldn't talk so soon. I can see it now, Dear Editor: I can't believe the insensitiv- ity displayed when your colum- nist discriminated against an al- ternative life form. Even if a person of another planet did kid- nap Tony, why is it up to us to stigmatize him/her/it. It is pos- sible that on slhe/it' s planet, kid- napping i.s an acceptable thing. Who are we to impose our plan- etary culture on another life fonn that we've repressed for 50 years anyway. Joe \Politically\ Correct Well, I suppose in keeping with th~ spirit of column writing I should say something concrete. In all seri- ousness though, there is a reason why this column hasn't been seri- ous so far. I think we all need to collectively cheer up. I realize that mid-terms are quickly approaching and that this is a stressful time of year, but I think we all need to look on the bright side for once. Even the fact that I'm not complaining should be enough to cheer up the bookstore and food service people. If you are unhappy I have a few suggestions for you. First, consider the fact that no matter how bad things are, chances are you're bet- ter off than most. Even if I com- plain about the food service, I real- ize that there are starving children in Africa who wouldn't come near some of the stuff I've seen served. LETTERS TO TilE EDITOR autonomous organization in order to avoid getting entangled in the politics of individual and organizational credit-taking and any other selfish human motive. l feel that the attention directed at me and my fellow volunteers (many of whom were not mentioned) was a misrepresentation, an embarrassment and a clear violation of our intended goal. Validine Food Drive Article: A Misrepresentation Dear Editor, I am writing this letter to express my sincere gratitude to the Union College community for their help in making the Vali- Dine food drive a success. More than $5,000 was raised through · the patience and generosity ofthe student body. Your money will provide thousands of meals for those who would otherwise have nothing to eat. We are now in the process ·of finding a suitable recipient for this donation. Hopefully, this will mark the beginning of a meaningful and long-standi11g relationship between Union College and the receiving organization. However, I feel obligated to set the record straight concerning facts presented in last week's edition of The Concordiensis. I want to make it clear that the sole purpose of the Vali-Dine food drive and the consequent The V ali dine food drive was not intended to be used as a vehicle to generate publicity or recognition for any person, people or Greekorgani,zation whatsoever. participation of those involved was purely to provide food fm· those in need. (The Vali-Dine food drive was not intended to ' be used as a vehicle to generate publlcity or recognition for any person, people or Greek organization whatsoever.) Our purpose was to establish an Perhaps it is my fault for not having made our position clearer conceming public attention, and if so, then I apologize. Regardless, we need not lose sight of what was accomplished nor the grave hunger condition that surrounds all of us. I would like to thank all those who donated, the I'm only kidding, in complete se- riousness we have to remember how much better off we are as a community than most of the people in the world. We have a place to sleep and food to eat. As basic as those two things seem to us, they would be miraculous gifts to someone living in a third world country right now. While I sit here and wonder how I'll do in my math class, there are people starv- ing. There are people who are homeless, and those living in im- poverished conditions who would be more than happy to switch places with us, I mean, to some of us a bad day is when our J. Crew package hasn't anived, to others a bad day is when most of their village starves to death. I also think there are plenty of things to do on campus that can administration and particularly Steve Pearse, Director of Dining, whose enthusiasm and support enabled us to make the Vali-Dine cheer one up. When all else fails, go to the Rathskellar and order a chocolate shake. There is no problem that a shake at the Rathskellar couldn't solve. If I didn't know better, I would say that they lace them with some kind of mind altering drugs (for the letter to the editor types, I re- alize that the on I y drug in a Rathskellar shake is chocolate I WAS KIDDING). Well now that I got that off my chest. I feel much better. I guess the impot1ant thing to keep in mind during the next few weeks is to take everything in stride. Study hard, cheer up and I'm sure you will all succeed. Hopefully the space aliens will retum Tony next week. food drive a resounding success.

February 2, 1995, page 12 OPINIONS ' . . . . . . . 'LETTERS-TO -THE EDITOR I • - . . . . ' Sexism in the Gym? -Some Remarks to La.st Week's Opinion To the Editor: After carefully reading the re- sponses of Kojo Attah and Rawson Thurber in last week's paper, it looks as though there are some people that did not quite grasp what it was I was trying to convey in my a~icle two weeks ago. For tl1is reason I will try once again to explain what I was try- ing to get aCFOSS. First of all, let me mention that l had a chance to meet and speak with Kojo at our Hamilton meet last Saturday. While we were competing in the pool, Kojo's track team was competing in the gym just down the hall. He, as he would ptlt it, \blessed us with his heavenly appearance\ .. When l went and introduced myself, I be- lieve he might have taken that as a gesture to mean that I no longer believed anything I had written when he asked \Just let me ask you one thing, what were you thinking when you wrote that ar- ticle?\ Boy let me tell you, an in- teresting conversation ensued, and after about a half hour of debate, I felt as though perhaps he may have understood a little more what I was upset about. I understood very well where he was coming from, just from reading his article. All in all I b~lieve some good things came out of my article. Hell, I even got to meet Kojo, who seems to be a P,retty cool guy, but sue, and perhaps even alleviated as I walked away I felt there were a little with the extended hours, still a few things I needed to clear but lquestion whetherit will dis- up. sipate entirely from this one ity of funds from alumni are com- get out and tell me he did it on ing from people who also hap- · form and tone!

Some attention the exclusive use of the gym be- has been shed on weight room is- cause, as he told me, the major- pened to be football players. I do not know exactly where all the funding for the .gym comes from, but I highly doubt it a:ll (or even mostly) comes from alumni foot- ball players. Gee, maybe some of it comes from our 25;000.00 tu- ition? Or from alumni that just happen to do other sports at Union, or even none at all? The point here is I don't see how the football team has any more right over anyone at Union tothe.room. As swimmers go, we only lift in season (as a team), and it is only two times a week for an hour each. If the foot- ball team can lift tlu:ee times aday, four times a week, our little two hours is a far cry from doing any hann. But, who knows, maybe even our two hours need to be at another time of day? The overall schedule definitely needs some work. Rawson's article, I must say,. very vividly displays how little he knows about swimming. With comments like \the football team lifts in the-off season because their sport is almost wl10lly based on physical strength, whereas tbe aquatic endeavors (I just love how he chose his words h¢re!) seem to focus more on fonn and tone\.

I just want to address one more misinformed point he made: the swim team knows all too well that the foot'- ball team lifts early in the morn- ing \when most students are .... dreaming of loJ:Iipops and gum drops\ because WE PASS BY THEM on the way to the pool!!! We work out at obscene hours in the moming as well, sacrificing precious sleep just as they do. Finally, I just want you to un- derstand, the point of my article was not to make enemies out of the sw.imming and football teams. I was using the weight room inci- dent with the football players (and yes, a FEW football players) to il- lustrate the problem of the weight room and also to convey some anger that we felt since the foot- ball players had their own lifting time and these players (yes, only a few) were still butting into ours. Obviously some serious attention needs to be paid to the problem. We are college students, people, and we ought to be able to come up with a solution that will please everyone. Jenn Terrell I ·I j

This sort of attention is not en- tirely new as the group has be- tween them years of musical ex- perience as members of bands such as Cracker, Joe Rockhead, Courtesy of tire Visual Arts Department Artist April Gomik will give a talk on her evocative work on Wednesday, February 8, in t11e College Center Auditorium at 7:00 pm, as part of the ongoing 'Figu- rative Issues' series of exhibitions and lectures, planned in conjunc- tion with the College's bicenten- nial. The event is free of charge and the public is wannly invited. Gomik's talk will include slides and discussion of her large-scale landscapes which have drawn widespread attention and critical praise. Though primarily known for her paintings, April Gornik has also worked extensively in the medias of drawing and· printmaking, which will be ad- dressed in her talk. Whatever media she uses; April Gornik's work is iwted for its monumental scale depicting ex- pansive, luminous images replete with memories of vivid personal Mojo Nixon, Poi Dog Pondering, and others. But please don't call them re- fined. The guys were drawn to- gether by their common love of each other's playing and soul music, and decided to develop some new material together 0n their free nights. TI1ings devel- oped quickly. Their music has been aptly de- scribed as ~'alternative soul'' by the Austin Chronicle, but the Uglies would prefer to avoid tags and let the music speak for itself. \From ·the beginning, we had more of an original bent, and we went off into our own dimen- sion,'' recalls bass player Sean McCarthy, \obviously the soul influence· was there, but every time we played together we would explore whatever and \Vherever the music would take us;'' Eventually things got so stinky, so smelly and so right that the guys had no choice but to quit their other gigs and become full time Ugly Atnericans. TI1e band's detennination to maintain the feel and sound that brought them to- gether is perfectly displayed in the V-' • •-,. -- \.\'\ 'lo,-• :.,., ~'· experiei1ces, often setting up a rapport between objects in what the artist describes as a 'classic mode for contemplation.' While there is much clarity of fonn ·in her work, a simultaneous mys- tery, ambiguity, arresting per- spective, and disquieting light arises from an imaginative atnio- sphere of conjecture. Questions involving relationships of space, the meaning of light, one's searching, and a plenitude of metamorphic possibilities abound in Gornik's art, tran- ·scending both the abstract and realist camps of artistic expres~ sian. In the words of commen- tator Carter Radcliff, \[April Gornik's] uninhabited land- scapes are themselves person- ages ... , emblems of the world understood as an analog to one- self,\ concluding that, \She has enlarged our idea of what land- scape painting can be.\ April Gornik attended the Ugly Americans to perform in Albany witlz the Big Head Todd and the Monsters and the Dave Matthews Band at the Palace Theatre on February 8th. {photo courtesy of W.A.R. public relations) nine original songs on the Ugly Americans CD.

CD Review: Dummy by Jody Mousseau Concordiensis Staff Shocked. l11at's exactly what I was when I heard Portishead's release \Dummy.\ It is by far one ofthe best new CO's in. a while. The cross between Tori Amos and a rap rhythm, with a Pink Floyd mysticism, creates a new sound. The style lets the listener get c~ught .t~P. in. the soft words, and iwt h1 aif overbearing noise. · Billboard stated, \Portishead 1nakes Joy Division and the Smiths sound like prose from a · HalliJ1~rk greeting card ... Records like this are one in a million.\ TI1e mysterious, profound sound can be compared to absolutely noth- ing I have ever heard before. n1e complex and unexpected begin- nings to the songs lead into a more gentle and soothing sound. Their style is very relaxing, but an ob- scure type of relaxing which · leaves the listener in an \out of mind\ state. If I haven't already made my opinion of the CD quite obvious, then you evidently do not read English. I highly recommend Portishead's \Dummy\, for any occasion. Campus Paperback Bestsellers 1.

February 2, 1995, Page 14 ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT Would You Rather Spend the Night With Davidor Jay? by Leena Mankad A & E Editor My friends are .great and I love them dearly, but there are some fundamental things that we argue about. This topic in particular can breed the more destructive argu- ments in a relationship. It defines people in a special way .... sort of like cat people and dog people. What is this topic you ask? It is the great debate: Are we watch- ing Late Night with David Letterman or The Tonight Show with Jay Leno this evening? In- terestingly enough, this ridiculous question can cause intense prob- lems. Rarely do you find a large group of people in agreement to this si,tuation ... or in my case, you are the only one that is in disagree- ment. Many of you might not care either way about late night TV. But there are Jay people and there are Dave people ... and the two don't mix. I've taken the libetty write out some differences for you: Late Night WUh David Letterman Dave Lettennan is a great guy. He started out on NBC after TI1e Tonight Show With Johnny Carson, and gained a fair amount of stardom. He gained even more stardom when he was ditched by NBC as The Tonight Show re- placement, and lost to Jay Leno. Dave packed up bitterly and left to CBS, where he was given the 1 1:30pm time slot. In many ways, this move was good for him. He left his safe NBC nest to have his own kingdom. Letterman's humor is much more acrimonious in nature. His monologue and his jokes are ba- sically blows at celebrities and politicians, but he manages to intertwine just enough sarcasm into his act. Dave banters with his band leader Paul Schaffer and does the usual kidding around. His signature is of course, his Top Ten lists. These lists are oftentimes ridiculously funny and often dry as well. He was probably the inspiration, to some degree, for The Concordiensis.' own Uncle Edna. At any rate, Dave Letterman is also good at phoning random people on the air, including his mother. Many were devastated when he moved to CBS, because he had to sever ties with the secretary they al- ways used to call in the building opposite his studio. His guests are interesting, es- pecially that Madonna ordeal, but Dave manages to rub his guests wrong more often than once. Letterman seems to have some deep seeded anger, that usually turns into some kind of sarcastic poke towards his guests. A simple way to get an idea about· Dave: He's angered the entire nation of Pakistan with his exploitation of Sirajul and Mujibar, the two Indian men that Dave has sent around the world. Many think the bit. is hilarious, Mezzos-soprano to Perform at Union Courtesy of Public Relations Mezzo-soprano Jard van Nes, one ofthe world class lieder sing- ers, with pianist David Selig will perform a program of music by Siebel ius, Mahler and Debussy on Friday, February 3, at 8 pm in Memorial Chapel. Van Nes, who is giving the only lieder recital in the Capital District this year, is to make her New York City re- cital debut at the Fried Collection the following Sun- day. Her appear- ance is part of the Schenectady Museum-Union Col- lege International Festival of Chamber Music. The Dutch mezzo-soprano is renowned for the warmth, purity and remarkable range of colora- tion she lends to her repertoire. She has been guest soloist with the London, Los Angeles, Oslo, Ber- lin and Royal philhannonics; BosN ton, Atlanta, Montreal, Dallas and San Francisco symphonies. She has recorded on a number of la- bels including Philips, Deutsche Grammophon and Teldec. Her Teldec issue of Mendelssohn's Elijah was cited by Gramophone as 1992's\ Choral Recording of the Year.\ David Selig, born in Australia, moved to Paris to study at the Conservatoire with Also Ciccolini. He also studied with Gtlido Agosti and Geoffrey Par- sons. He won prizes at the Sydney piano competition and the inaugural ac- companiment competition in the Hague. Memorial Chapel, located near the center of the Union College camptis, has warm acmistics that make it a favorite venue of area· chamber music fans. Parking is available on campus. Tickets, $12 ($6 for students), are available from Schenectady Museum and at the door. For in- formation, call (518)3 82-7890 (days) or 372-3651 (evenings). but Pakistan expects a full apol- ogy from Dave for his actions. Letterman can be good at belit- tling people, especially minorities sometimes. The Tonight Show With Jay Leno Jay Leno started out in night- clubs with his stand up comic rou- tine. He gained much fame and began guest hosting on The To- njght Show, when Carson wanted the night off. NBC finally made Leno the permanent host of The Tonight Show, a brave move by the network. There was mixed reaction to all of this, and Jay was kind of the enemy. But he built a new set, hired a new band, changed the stage curtain to a solid color (as opposed to Jhonny's rainbow col-. ors) and is now finally gaining bad habit is flirting with his fe- male stars a bit too much. At any rate, Jay teases his band members, including Kevin, a guitarist, who can't seem to get a date. This has become a run- ning joke. Another highlight of The Tonight Show is Jay Leno' s frequent trips backstage, where he harasses Days of Our Lives Stars, who share _the back studio. Both shows are great, but there are numerous differences .. While Dave c.omes off as niore intellectual, and sarcastic, Jay comes off as more a teddy bear, with goofy humor. Dave seems to bask in his own humor, oftentimes I aughing at things that are funny just to himself. Jay tends to work his -late mother and father into his act, and af- fectionately jokes about them \Many of you might not care either way about late night TV. But there are Jay people and there are Dave people .•. and the two don't mix. I've taken the liberty to write out so me differences for you.'' some respect and ratings. Lena's humor is not as dry as Letterman's. Jay's monologue is more like his stand-up comic rou- tine only condensed into ten min- utes. He makes cracks at politi- cians, but they are based more on poking fun of the subject's action rather than apersonal blow. Lena is noted most for his bit called Headlines, where he shares real · Headlines ffoni across the coun- try that have gone awry. On the whole, Jay's humor is not quite as harsh. Jay's guests are equally as. in- teresting as Dave's, but he doesn't exploit them quite as much. Jay's from time to time. Sometimes, Jay can be more human than Dave, especially when Jay tn!lde a beautiful speech on ,the recent death of his parents. Jay was not afraid to let his gu11rd down, something that audiences haven't received from Dave yet. What each man finds funny is definitely different, and it is purely a matter .. gf ta.ste to the audiencJ ;hich'brand they pre- fer. The problem with Jay's lm- mor is that sometimes, it is just plain stupid. While Jay comes off as the boy next door with his goofy humor, it can also be seen as annoying sometimes. Leno banks off of his wit to get laughs, occasionally coming up with in- tensely funny one-liners. He com- pensates for his bad jokes by his high.-pitched, silly lat~gb. Dave banks on other people to get his laughs, and this sometimes make Dave look like not a nice. guy. Location makes a big differ- ence. Letterman broadcasts from New York, while Lenofrom Los Angeles. Obvionsly, this breeds different audiences and settings which are influential to jokes and reactions. Jay did have some dif- ficulty getting laughs whe11 he had a one week stint New York a few months ago. As for bands, the music on Leno is more a mixture of brass and woodwind, more traditional jazz with band leader Bran ford Marsalis. Dave's Patti Schaffer has a more electronic smmd, with keyboards. Leno teases his band members, and Dave just has fminy conver- sations with his, but they are both great bands and hav,e unique sounds. So who's better? Who knows. Ratings are pretty decent for each side. But there will always be Dave people and Jay people. as fanny opinion, if you couldn ~ttell already, I think that David Lettennan is a pompous, diy-hu- mored kind of guy, while Jay is more of a bone head. But that's great for me because I'm into bone-headed humor, more so than Dave's sarcastic pokes. My friends are all Lettennan fans and that's great for them. ljustdo1ny English homework at 11:30.

Michael Eck: Maximum Solo Acoustic by Suzanne Robinson A & EEditor On Friday, February 3, 1995, at 9 PM Michael Eck will be per- fanning at Coffeehouse in Union College's Rathskeller. Michael Eck is a mandala hand recording artist and has been widely recog- nized for his great talent. He is known for his maximum solo acoustic perfonnances. \lf you think whatever that dreadlocked guy's name is (Counting Crows' Adam Duritz) to be a musical genius, you should check out the real thing - Michael Eck,\ states in the Albany Sludenl Press.

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT February 2, 1995, Page 15 Pan Asian Repertory to Participate in Union's Asian American Week by Suzanne Robinson A & E Editor OnTuesday,Febmary7, I995, at 7 pm, the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre will participate in Union's Asian American week. They will put on a production that will include performances of three ex:cerpts of the following plays; Leiters to a Student Rem- lutionary. ( \wnbodia Agonistes. and Wilderness. At the end of these perfonnan.ces, there will be a Q&A session, which the audi- ence will be able to ask question~ of the artists. I.eflers to a ,)'tudent Revolution- ary was written by Elizabeth Woag, and directed by Ernest Abuba. The story \chronicles the long-distance relationship be- tween two Chinese women, one American bom and the other from Beijing, until the fateful day in June 1989 on Tiananmen Square. Bibi is the model of the modem Asian American, a second-gen- eration career woman searching for meaning amidst the malls and highways in the U.S.; Karen is a disaffected office clerk who dreams of fashion and freedom in America while working in the shadow of Communist China's oppressive bureaucracy.\ \In this brief play, Miss Wong settles for a personalized, anec- dotal approach, followed by that swift, sad closedown. The mas- sacre in Tiananmen Square ends the play and also the correspon- dence,\ it is stated in a review in the New York Times. Cambodia Agonis(es was writ- ten by Ernest Abuba, music by Louis Stewart, and directed by Tis a Chang. TI1is play traces ''the joumey of a classical Cambodian dancer haunted by memories of the killing fields in her homeland, to her spiritual salvation in America. Seen through the \eyes\ of a Cambodian dancer, now a refugee working in a Chinatown sewing factory, the recent tragedy in Caiiibodia and the ensuing plight of refugees is developed to culminate in a tri- umphant confrontation of good over evil.\ In the New York Times, it is said \the musical leaves the audience with a sense ofloss, trying to comprehend how a nation can sacrifice its people as well as its defining traditions.\ Wildemess, written by Cao Yu and directed by Lili Liang, \is the most powerful yet least produced play by Cao Yu, the foremost leading Chinese playwright of this century. Set in China in the early 1920's, this play allegories the Chinese class struggle. The tragic hero Chou Hu, a hunted fugitive, seeks the way out of the wildemess, and the path to a new life of freedom.\ Pan Asian Repertory Theatre was established in 1977 with a Murder in the First: · Review Not by Larry by Jody Mousseau Concordiensis Staff Last week, my friends and I decided that it was time to ven- ture off campus. So we made our most spontaneous trip to the movie theater in order to avoid yet another night of beer and Regal. Awaiting our joumey, the will was present, but the the- aters left us with a rather lim- ited selection. So we settled for \Murder in the First.\ \Murder in the First\ is based on a true story. Henry Young was a man who committed a petty crime in the 1930's and was sent to Alcatraz. In an es- cape attempt, Young was caught and placed in solitary confinement. As a result of the situations involved. which I will not reveaL in case anyone would wish to view the movie, another crime is committed and Young is brought up on charges. His young, aspiring attomey fights hard to restore justice, with disregard to the mockery that he receives from his peers. Kevin Bacon, who portrays Henry Young, and Christian Slater, who plays the young at~ tomey, make the most out of their parts. The story itself is very intense, and the movie could have been much more powerful if it had been written slightly differently. The over- all portrayal of events seemed that they were well p o r - trayed. My stron- g e s t qualm is that the m o v 1 e ended too quickly, and I felt as if I never grasped the full conclusion. TI1e story displayed a ·sym- bolic emotional deprivation and rebuilding of relationships between two people. \Murder in the First\ was by all means quality material and would never be able to be justly com~ pared to \Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\ However, a movie with the magnitude of poten- tial that it had could have been mesmerizing. I recommend this movie only if you desper- ately want to get off campus. handful of dedicated artists. Over the years their productions have included, amongst the greater ones, Midsummer Night's Dream, set in IOOOBC China, Yellow Fe- rer, the long running Asian Ca- nadian gumshoe spoof, and Shogunl'vfucbeth, the intercultural masterpiece. The fo~mderofPan Asian Rep- ertory TI1catre, as well as the Ar- tistic Producing Director, Tisa Chang, states in the following how the company was fanned: '\From the beginning I had a dream that Asian American art- ists should follow our artistic as- pirations to wherever it would lead us even to reaching the pro- fessional zenith in the American TI1eatte. I dreamt that an Asian Am eric an actor could portray leading roles unlimited by mis- conceptions and stereotype. Til at we, too, could be accepted as Clytemnestra, a Blanche Dubois, the Manchu Empress Dowager. \To be an attist is to be blessed. Perfonrtance is an act 9f giving, of releasing energies which will never be the same but may retum to us, re-constituted, to begin an- other cycle of nourishment. Pan Asian Rep was founded to nur- ture and support those who have dedicated their life's pursuit to and made sacrifices to stay in the living theatre. \An ensemble of artists united by professional commitment and Tire Pam Asian Repertory Theatre Production of Letters to a Student Revolutionary. (plzoto courtesy of Corky Lee) shaped by cultural heritage, who share the celebratory traditions of rhythm and movement, would become the springboard to forg- ing a repertoire of new Asian American works. Plays which reflect the evolution of Asians in America our secrets, struggles and celebrations expressed in a myriad of artistic modes and in a new found common language, English.'' I strongly suggest that you spend the evening with the Pan Asian Repertory TI1eatre. After a night of their enlightenment, you will definitely have a differ- ent outlook on life, both Ameri- can and Asian. CROSSTALK! DEATH PENALTY: Solution or Problem?

' ' ' ' .f' I, February 2, 1995, page 18 SPORTS Swimming Teams Suffer Tough Losses to Hamilton by Julie Ivanyi Concordie11sis Staff \11lis past weekend. the swim team traveled to Clinton. New .York. where they swam against a powerful competitor. Hamilton College. Hamilton has been a consistently strong team for the past few years and. just like .lJnion, 1s only improv.ing. Hamilton is very similar to Union academically and in swim pro- grams. This results in heavy, competitive recruiting of the same individuals. Although there is a large rivalry, it is a friendly one. In traveling to Hamilton, both Union teams knew there were tough meets facing them. For the men, this was an oppor- tunity to swim in the pool that they will be racing in for the State Championships. l11e last time the women swam in this pool was two years ago at the State Cham- pionships. where they placed sec- ond behind Ithaca, but ahead of Hamilton. Both meets were filled with excitement, as two equivalent teams put their best abilities forth. \Union swam well, but Hamilton swam great,\ Coach Bassett ex- pressed. For the men, they were up against the defending State Champions at their own pool. For the women, they were com- peting against a team ·who is hun- gry for a State. Championship. Although Union's teams are packed with talent, the Hamilton teams are equally granted with a plethora of deteTTll ined athletes. Perhaps the meet would have con- cluded differently if the meet was at Union. but that question will have to be saved for next season's competition. As was stated by Coach Bassett. the Dutchmen swan'l very welL many individuals having season- best times. One such S\vimmer was junior John fitzgerald who captured 2nd place in the 1 000. His time was his best time this season, and will surely continue to drop at the State Champion- ships. Later on in the meet, he swam the 500, placing a strong 4th in another time that is far ahead ofhis times at this stage in the season last year. The distant swimmers all had a strong meet, including Than Stuntz, Matt Glogowski, and Adam Horst. Although Union was able to cap- ture I st place in many events, Hamilton was able to follow through with 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places, which lead to the differ- ence in the score. Such events were the 200 Free, where Kevin Makarowski touched out the Hamilton swimmer by 6 tenths of a second. Unfortunately, Hamilton was then able to take the next three places, with times all very close to one another. An- other such event was the 200 IM, where Scott Bowden beat his op- ponent by almost a full second. In this event, Hamilton took the next 4 places, but were unable to score this many places due to the fact that one team is only allowed to Union Track Has Rough Weekend at Hamilton by Mike Leding Concordiensis Staff Once again injuries and sick- ness took its toll on the Union College men and women's track and field teams. l11e men fin- ished tenth out of eleven, and the women finished eleventh out of eleven. The top six finishers placed in this meet; however, when a team competes with only about twelve people each, there- sults are not going to be that im- pressive. The only woman to place was Nadine Filosi. Nadine placed sixth in the high hurdles in a time of 9.49 seconds. A few women did post personal bests for them- selves, however: Jenn Schwartz ran a 5:44.9 in the 1500 meters, and Michele Woodward threw the shot 7. 79 meters For the men, Rich Pulver once again attempted to carry the team on his back along with sprinters Dave Riggi and Kojo Attah. Pulver placed first in the shot put with a throw of 15.66 meters, setting a meet record. Rich has already qualified automatically for Na- tionals. Pulver also placed fifth in the weight throw with a dis- tance of 11.84 meters. Dave Riggi placed third in the 55 meters in a time of 6.79s, fol- lowed by Kojo Attah in fourth with a time of 6.8ls. The only other notable feat was performed by Nick Conway, who registered a personal best in the 1500 meters by running a time of 4:14.06. Write for SPORTS Come to our weekly staff meetings. Today at 7:00pm in CC303 receive points for 3 places. Even though Jeff Fawcett, Eric Menard, and Mark Anderson swam hard, solid sw1ms, they were out matched by the I Iamilton power- houses. In the :200 Back, Mike Humphreys was unsurpassable,. conipletely domineering the field. Jeff Fawcett followed. just miss- ing Jrd place.by 3 tenths of a sec- ond. As with I1amilton, Union had many events where they were able to round up numerous points. In the 50 Free, Mike Humphreys and Mike Darbyshire took lst and 3rd, taking 12 points as opposed to Hamilton's 7. TI1is also oc- curred in the 100 Free, where Scott Bowden and Chris Riley took I st and 3rd. In this event, Union has 7 individuals who are able to swim it in under 50 sec- onds. Along with the above men- tioned two, Peter Spaulding, Mike Humphreys, Kevin Makar:owski, Than Stuntz, and Mike Darbyshire, have accmilplis'hcd this. No doubt others wiH follow in the upcoming month. This sort of feat on behalf of Union is the sort of characteristic that will bring them victory at the State Championships. Hamilton, graced with a very good diver, dominated the diving events, but this does not overshadow Matt Baumgartner's great meet. He placed a very strong 2nd in the 3 Meter event, and a close 3rd to Brian Field in the I Meter event. Although the meet ended jn a loss, with a score of 139 to 98, it does not reflect the ability of the Women's B-Ball Struggles by Lee Schachter Associate Sports Editor It was another tough week for the Union women's basketball team, as they lost two games-the first to Hartwick and the second to powerhouse Albany. How- ever, the win-loss column doesn't always tell the full story. The Hartwick game was a very close game, and as is the case with all close games, they are the toughest losses. The Albany game has more of a story behind it though. Albany, with a 10~5 record, is ranked in the east and is one of the toughest teams that Union must go up against during the season. However, with nine minutes left in the game, the Union squad trailed .by a mere one point, 55-54. Even though Albany ended the game with a 17-8 run that gave them the win, Union put forth a great effort. Andrea Pagnozzi had 22 points and 14 rebounds. Amy Hftz had I 0 points and 14 rebounds, while Amy Dougherty had 12 points and 5 rebounds. The rest of the team played well too. As senior co-captain Deb Montano said, \We played one of the best games we played all year. If it hadn't been against Albany, we would have won.\ The Dutchwomen comehome to play against Russel Sage on Monday and Vassar on Wednes- day. Both games are at 7:00 pm. U1iion team .to react under pres- sure. The women's meet of this weekend, greatly resembled their triumph over Middlebury last weekend. Tite meet followed the same pattem with Union trailing Hamilton by, at most, I 0 points. As with the men, Hantilton 's women had a lot of depth that granted them solid events. In the first half of the meet, Hamilton completely domineered each event, capturing first place along with others. After both rounds ofdiving, where Amy Laniphere and Nicole Rubin placed I st and 3rd, respectively, in the I Meter event, and 2nd and I st. respec- tively, in the 3 Meter event, Union was only behind by J points. Megan McCarthy. Mo O'Donnell, aJJd Flo Chretien, fol- lowed through by placing 2nd, 3rd and 5th in the 200 Fly. After the 200 Back, where Sarah Spaulding, Jenn Allaire, and Annie Rozwadowski placed I st. 3rd and 5th, the women were still behind by I 0 points. With their heads still in the meet and a hun- ger for victory,· the Bteastrokers came through with 1st, 2nd and 5th place finishes. Megan McCarthy, Melissa Pomerleau and Jenn Terrell brought Union only 6 points behind Hmnilton, and the ability to win the meet. Similarly to the Middlebury meet. Union needed to win and place 3rd in the 400 Free Relay to win the meet. TI1e '1\.' relay, consist- ing of Jonatha Meade. Eri Hayashi. Jenn Allaire, and Jackie Crane beat their opponents by haifa pool length. This relay will no doubt llim heads at the State Championships. Unfortunately, Hamilton split up their 'A' and 'B' relays tomaketwostrong re- lays. as they only needed 2nd and Jrd place finishes to win the meet. With two strong relays such as these, placing only 4 tenths of a second behind one another, Union was unable to capture 3rd place to win the meet. As Middlebury did last weekend, Union lost to Hamilton 121-122. TI1is o11ly drives the Dutchmen for faster and stronger swims at States in three weeks. Although Hamilton was successful this weekend they will be faced with greater strength at their next en- counter with Union in February. As Union prepar.es for their fi- nal dual meet of the season against St. Lawrence this coming weekend, they have this prev1ous meet stuck in their •ninds. It acts as a reminder of what is to come at States. TI1ey are hungry for revenge and hope to be celebrat- ing soon as Hamilton did this past weekend. This week, the two teams begin their groundwork for the big championships. Although the men's home meet season is over, the women's State Cham- pionships are being held at Union this year. TI1ey are February 16th through the 18th. It will surely be some tough competition. Sup- port from the college always en- courages victory. Hockey Heads North Contilmedfrom page 20 first in their division I history. the Dutchmen got goals from each of their fonr lines. However offense was not the key Saturday night. as the Dutchmen defense ·and Trevor Koenig held the offensive minded Vermont Catamounts to only one goal. The Dutchmen mounted an im- pressive effort, outshooting the Catamounts 40-24, although only one of their shots got by the Cata- mount netminder, Tim Thomas. Trevor Koenig was extremely solid in net, although Union's best save didn't come from him. Late in the second period a Catamount shot slipped through the pads of Koenig, and seemed destined for the back of the net. Defenseman Scott Boyd, detecting the urgency of the situation, rushed to Koenig's aid, and slid the puck back into Koenig's pads. How- ever early in the third period, Vennont got one by Koenig. tak- ing a 1-0 lead. The Dutchmen did not give up, and continued press- ing the Catamount defense. With seven mitiutes remaining in regulation. Union's fourth line tal- lied their second goal of the week- end. Sophomore Jan1ie Antoine made a nice move behind the Ver- mont net. and moved the puck into the slot. As a fitting reward for his excellent play of recent weeks, Craig Reckin received Antoine's pass, and shot it by the Catamount goalie, for a 1-l tie. TI1e Dutch- men dodged the bullet in the five minute overtirrte, and held on for their third tie of the season. Union's three point weekend. moved them into a tenth place, holding them in contention for the final playoff spot in the E.C .A.C. This weekend the Dutchmen travel north to faceoff against the Saints of St. Lawrence, and the na- tionally ranked Golden Knights of Clarkson.

by Mike Leding CoucordiellsisStaff This week's Athlete of the .. ' Week article is a feature on the Union College Hockey team's defense. In the last six games these eight men have held their opponents to 153 shots total, only an average of 25 shots a game. Union. on the other hand. l1as unloaded 224 times on their op- ponents goalie in these past six games, an average of 37 shots a game. TI1ese eight men eluded to above are Scott Boyd, Greg · Buchanan, Dean Goulet,· Shane Holunga, Bill Moody, Seabrook Satterlund, and Reid Simonton. In these six games the team's record is 2-3-l, the defense is one ofthe reasons behind Union's re- cent tumaround. The team was sliding there for awhile, but after last weekends l-0-1 showing. they seem to be on a high now. These me11 are all contributors. even though some of the mem- bers of the defense receive more ice tune than others. Here is a statistical breakdown for each of theth. Will and Goulet are on the ice together most of the time. Will has the most impressive of- fensive statistics out of all the defensemen thus far. He bas scored six goals and dished out ten assists. He is third overall on the team in scoring, and his six- teen points are ten more than the next highest point scoring defensemen. Will has a +6 plus/ minus rating, which means that Union has scored six more times than they have let the opponent score while he has been on the ice - a t1attering statistic for any defenseman. His comiterpart Goulet has a+ I I plus/minus rat- ing. by far the best on the whole team. Goulet has yet to score, but ··sPORTS February 2, 1995, page 19 he has six assists~ he plays more a defensive role than Will, and he is not afraid to try and put some- one through the boards. For the second year in a row, Simonton and Boyd are on tl1e ice together. Simonton was drafted by the Que- bec Nordiques last June and has one goal and five assists on the season. He is a very tough hitter and sometimes gets penalized by the officials for his nmgh play, the kind of play that most hockey fans like to see. Boyd, a fanner Ath- lete of the Week, has four assists on the year, and a + 1 plus/minus rating. Satterlund is usually on the ice with Moody or Holunga. Satterlund has four assists on the season and is a part ofthe sopho- more four along with Will, Moody, and Buchanan which gives the team an ample amount of youth left on defense after the depart of Goulet this year and the eventual passing of Simonton, Boyd, and Holunga at the end of next season. With so much tal- ent, Coach Delventhal must have trouble managing the ice time of these men. Moody, Holunga, and Buchanan have yet to register any points this year; however, it is not their job to provide any points, but rather to keep the other team from scoring. These three do their fair share of checking in rounding out the defensive corp. These men need to keep up their good work and keep protect- ing these goalies as the team tries to get some sort of streak together as they head towards the playoffs. The team needs to come together, play as a unit, and reach that po- tential that they showed last year and have showed flashes of this year. TI1e student body needs to keep showing their support as the team heads to Clarkson and St. Lawerence this weekend. Stevens Takes Off! Co11timtedjrompage 20 most -of the opporttmity. Chad Thompson is also expected to il I help fill the gap of Steven's ab~ sence. TI1e team is shocked at Steven's departure, but has main- tained a -good attitude about this weekend. Captain Cory Holbrough said,\ I don't think it's that distracting. You're losing one of your team members, and Captaill Cory Rolbrouglt, Coaclt Bruce Delvelltlral, and Senior Luigi Villa answer questions at tile press corifetellce. Delventlral announced til at Troy Stevens will be leavilrg Union to turn pro. (photo by Rick Lederer for Tile Concordiensis) we consider ourselves a family ... but we're all pretty happy for Troy. He's made the decision to pursue a dream, and we can't hold him back ... This is something he wants to do, so we're all behind him 100%. He's gone now, and we have to look past that and get ready for this weekend.\ Stevens is not the first of Union College hockeY. players to go pro- fessional. Terry Campbell has played in Germany and Dwayne Joyce has played for the lntema- tional League. Reed Simonton is a Quebec draft, but is firm in fin- ishing school and receiving his degree. Nobody can predict what will happen to the Skating Dutch- men. However, Oelventhal does not think that a tum for the worst will occur. \TI1ere are a lot of guys in the locker room who are really looking forward to show- ing people that we're not a one man team.\ Perhaps we will be watching Troy Stevens years from now in the NHL. Best of luck to both the Union hockey team and Troy Stevens. ..... . '

Concordiensis'Sta{f After a disappointing 5-2 loss against the Bulldogs of Yale, the Skating Dutchmen were hoping to better their las-t place 2-6-2 E.C.A.C. record at horne against Dartmouth and Vermont. On Fri- day night the Dutchmen played host to the Big Green of Dartmouth. Dartmouth, despite being one o teams in Divi- sion I hockey, gave the Dutchmen a run for their money. Union . played extremely well in the first two periods, out scoring the Big Green 5-2, before forfeiting three late third period goals. Union took a lead five minutes into the first period, when fresh- man Boe Leslie tallied his first career goal. Leslie received a pass from Craig Reckin, skated through the Dartmouth defense, and put it by the helpless goaltender. Reid Simonton re- ceived the other assist. The Dutchmen went ahead 2-0, when sophomore John Sicinski banged home a Chris Albert rebound for his fourth goal of the season, cap- tain Cory Holbrough recorded the other assist. Dartmouth tied the score early in the second period, before John Sicinski's second goal put the Dutchmen ahead for good. This time around, Sicinski received a pass from Holbrough, put a nice move on the Dartmouth defender, and shot it by him for a 3-2 Union lead. l11e Dutchmen extended their lead to 4-2, when Chad 11wmpson, at the end ofhis Trevor Koenig makes a glove save as Andrew Will trails tlte play during Union's 1-1 tie against UVM. (Scott Druckemiller/TC) shift passed the puck to a streak- ing Charlie Moxlu~m. Moxham slid the puck to Jay Prentice, who on his second effort put it by the helpless goaltender. The Dutchmen added their fifth goal, off the opening faceoff of the third period. Chad Thomp- son won the draw to Charlie Moxham, who brought the puck into the Dartmouth zone. Moxham gave it once again to linemate Jay Prentice who shot it passed the Dartmouth netminder Senior Mark Stodden bri11gs tl1e half up tile court during Union's 85-81 home loss to Elmira on Saturday. Tile Dutchmen jell to 8-7 with tile loss. (photo by Scott Druckemiller!TC) for his sixth goal of the season and a 6-2 Union lead. From then on things began to fall apart for Union. The Dutch- men sat back on their laurels and watched as the Big. Green mounted an impressive come- back. Trevor Koenig was unchar- acteristically soft in net, allowing Dartmouth to score three con- secutive goals, before saving the game with one minute remaining in the period. Although the Dutchmen gave up in the third period, they did record a much need victory. In addition for the Continued on page .I 8 • • . NOw the BadNews . . Troy Stevells Turns Pro, Leaves Dutchmen in Midseason by Jody Mousseau Concordie11sis Staff Monday, the Skating Dutch- men were hit with shocking news. Unexpectedly. sophomore for- ward Troy Stevens, ofComJRap- ids, Minnesota, has left Union hockey to pursue a career inprCh fessional ho~key. Stevens an· nounced Monday to the team ~hat his lifelong dream was within reach, ancl that,he ·was going to leave to begin playing for the Nashville Knights of the East Coast Hockey League. Stevens has been one of the key players on the team both last sea- son and this season. The Dutch- men finished last season in sixth place with a 1 0-9-3 record. Troy Stevens was the team's second leading scorer last season with 34 points, and led with 28 assists. Last year, he and Chris Ford were both named to the ECAC All- Rookie team. According to Union's press release, this season, Stevens was tied for first with 13 assists and was also tied for sec- ond in scoring with 17 points. He also led in faceoffs this season with 59.3%. \Tt took us off guard,\ com- mcntcd Coach Bruce Delventhal. \He said that he had an opportu- nity to go play professionally and that it was a dream of his and at that time he didn't tell me where. I was happy for him in the sense that it was a dream that he has wanted to purStte, and on the other hand I was disappointed that he hadn't spoken with us about ~his before and also that he had ten games left.\ Troy .Steve11s l1ad commetited earlier, \It was a very difficult personal decision that I've thought about for a very long time. I feel it is tl1e right time for 1ne to leave schqol and. pursue my goal of trying to make it in the National Hockey Leaglie .... I liked going to Union and I liked play- ing hockey for Uni011, but I didn't feel I could give '100 percent to both. I've been giving this a lot of thought since the beginning of the year. It is the toughest deci- sion that I've ever had· to make in my life.\ The opportunity was there, but the timing, to describe it at best, was poor. TI1e Dutchmen are tied for 1Oth place, the last playoff spot, and this weekend they will travel north to play Clarkson and St. Lawrence. Delventhal stated, \We have the North Country trip it1 a pick of a playoff race here, and that's what matters first and foremost to us ... We'd like to have Troy here, but we're going to show up Friday night in Potsdam and we're going to play good hockey.\ Sophomore forward, Ryan Donovan, who has not been play- ing for the past few games due to a knee injury, will fill Steven's position at center. Coach Delventhal is expecting Donovan to come back strong and make the Co11tinued on page 19

This status now al- lows them to attend meetings and gives them the right to reserve rooms on cam- pus to hold meetings or host activities. They do not, however, have a vote on the Council. The Panhellenic Council is the board that governs Greek women at Union Co] ... lege. It promotes cooperation among the sororities. Four sororities, Delta Delta Delta, Sigma Delta Tau, Delta Gamma and Gamma Phi Beta, currently hold the fgur top offices and elect representatives arid delegates to the Council. In addition, Omega Phi Beta has associate member status. The Union College members of Sigma Iota Alpha are actually members of the sorority at SUNY at Albany. Last spring, four women from Union pledged the so- rority and became sisters at the Alpha Chapter in Albany. Three women from Union are currently members of the so- rority. Schenectady, New York February 9, 1995 Steinmetz Moved to Prize Day by MicheiUe Ellis Associate News Editor \It's now February and time to think about what you want to submit [to Steinmetz Symposium],\ Dean Schadler, the Associate Dean of Under- graduate Students encouraged. The 1995 Steinmetz Symposium wiH be oc- curring in conjunction with Prize Day this spring. Due to the fact that the National Con- ference for Undergraduate Research (NCUR) is coming to Union this spring and classes will be canceled on April 20 and 22, it was originally thought that Steinmetz would have to be canceled because the College is reluctant to can- cel additional classes for symposium. Dean Schadler indicated that the arrival ofNCUR was the reason that Steinmetz has been incorporated into the festivi- ties of Prize Day. The Steinmetz Symposium has been arranged into three sessions spanning both May J 2 and 13. This year, Sandra Perez, class of 1996 and treasurer ofthe Alpha Chapter, began attending Panhell enic Council meetings to learn more about what the Council does. Perez explained that originally, she was not allowed to attend meetings because the sorority was not on the Council. Perez then presented a statement on the organization's philosophy and activities.

On Saturday, February 25 at 7:30 pm, the college will be able to witness where a great deal of the money is going. The Memorial Field House. home of indoor track and hoops, is being trans- formed into a suitable environ- ment for the gala. To provide a formal environment, black cur- tains will be hung in front of the bleachers. Lights will hide the more ''heavenly'' aspects of the field house, and a student initi- ated balloon fest will add char- acter. One of the largest additions to the field house in celebration of the Gala is a $5000 removable floor covering to protect the bas- ketball courts. The floor will be installed a few days before the event. Despite the cost, the floor covering is claimed to be an in- vestment for· the college. It will allow other groups to use the Memorial Field House for events, such as the Steinmetz Sympo- sium, which has not been conceiv- able in the past. The floor is an important addition, especially with Union hosting the National Conference of Undergraduate Research. Professor Nichols comwented on Union's invest- ment. It will \bring the campus to higher standards.\ Athietic events will be moved due to the upcoming gala. Home basketball games will be held at Niskayuna High School. Though it may seem as if the school is bending over backwards to hold the Gala, all who attend will see the Memorial Field House as never before.

Source: T/1e New York Times by Matt Sandler - Concordiensis Staff Commemorating the Soviet lib- eration of the Nazi Auschwitz- Birkenau death camp that re- cently past, leaves us with two feelings. outrage and horror, and the relief that the Soviets did lib- erate the camp and forstall futher human suffering and death. Fifty years after all that unbelivable evil, the victims still haunt us and are always in our minds as coun- tries chart their courses through future history. Titis sight is where historians estimate that 1.1 to 1.5 Ihillion people died at the camp, 90 percent of the victims being Jews .. TI1e important point to un- derstand is that genocide of any group,Jews, Polish people, Gyp- sies, and any other nationality that the Nazis thought inferior, is rep- rehensible and unforgiveable. Elie Wiesel, the writer and Nobel laureate who suffered at the hands of the Nazis said, \Al- though we know that God is mer~ ciful, please God, do not have mercy for those people who cre- ated this place [Auschwitz].

They passed the spot where Dr. Josef Mengele stood selecting victims, \left\ for the gas chambers or \right\ for slave labor. They were led by Menashe Lorenzy who was one of the many people subjected to experi- ments by Dr. Mengel e. Mr. Lorenzy recalled how when he first arrived at the camp, an SS guard said, \See that smoke coming from the chimneys? TI1at's your family.\ Hitler was the catalyst for Gennany's inten- sive and insane hate policies, but he did not create the sublying hate that existed in the core of the Ger- mans. Hitler used the hate as a mechanism to rallytng the masses, and then the soldiers car- ried on with inhumane acts be- yond Hitler's \Final Solution to the Jewish Problem.\ Such acts were so horrific that they are un- you are doomed to repeat them. This is not a saying it is the abso- lute tntth. People have to know what happened, by studying the hotTific facts. It is important to see ,)'chindler 's Ust and other -movies or documentaries that de- tail the way it was. What is scaty is that what we consider to be ir- rational and barbaric acts by Na- zis, the people of Gennany in the Titird Reich thought was logical and sane, The Nazis employed Technocrats to insure .that their policies were carried out with extreme efficiency. The only way our world can step into tomorrow with a real sense of security is if we are looking backwards at the past, with an understanding of those lessons and a willingness to never let this happen again.

FEATURES Help from Suzie Q: \Since EMO's Input Is Not Enough\ Erin M. O'Neil and guest-star Suzanne Q. Silverstein It seems a long time since rve bitched about the day to day workings of the Union College campus (weJI, at least a few weeks). But my input is no longer enough. It is time to call on oth- ers to voice their concems as well. With this in mind, my witty room- mate Suzanne Q, Silverstein has agreed to collaborate with me on these pressing issues. Suzru1ne, take it away ....... SALAD BAR ETIQUETTE-. Those of you who frequent Up- per Class Dining Hall, like my- self, are familiar with the salad bar. If this pertains to you, you must also be familiat· with the unspoken rules. Namely, start at the lettuce and end with the dress- ing. By no means, especially dur- ing \rush hour,\ does any indi- vidual have the right to enter the line in between. If you don't want lettoce or carrots, WAIT, don't enter at the tofu. Suck it up and deal with the line; everyone else does. My point is as follows: the next person who cuts in front of me at the salad bar- I'M FLIP- PING YOUR TRAY! Point well taken Suzani1e, but don't worry, if you missed the salad bar today, you can catch it tomorrow in the soup at Dutch Hollow. This is certainly an is- sue that has needed to be ad- dressed for some time now. Es- pecially for you sophomores who are now permitted to enter the luxury of Upperclass dining. What it comes down to- follow the rules, or go back to West where you belong. Now, you mentioned something about rice krispy treats, could you please elaborate? Basically, I want to know who is in charge of making the rice krispy treats, and why are they mysteriously missing every fifth day? We've all seen the commer- cial, THEY'RE EASY TO MAKE! Skip the brownies or something, no one eats them any- way. Y o~t 're right, and what about those fat-free Blueberry Morning muffins? What is a blueberry mo111ing exactly? Are there blue- berry evenings as well? Can you eat these at any other .time of the day? What's the deal?! And while we're on the subject of the inner-workings of the college center, didn't you have something to say about the lone e-mail com- puter? Why yes, Erin, I did. I must admit, like many others, I have · been sucked into the world of VAX. With this in mind, I seem to be an exception in this e mail cult. I still know how to speak; my only fonn of communication is not computers. What I'm try- ing to say is. that I'm si·ck of people looming over my shool- der waiting for me to \log off.\ Why don't you speak up and ask how long I'll be? If you ask me nicely, I'll probably tell you the tmth. Just stop loafing behind me or I'LL KICK YOUR COM- PUTER GEEK ASS! ln the words of Joey Lawrence, \WHOA!\ I never realized you felt so strongly. Just remember Suzanne, computers are our friends, and they deserve the same respect as you and me. Just a little public service announcement. Now do you have any closing re- marks for our readers? Yes, I have one more qualm. It doesn't pertain to food or the col- lege center, but to academics. Why is it that when professors pass out their syllabus, reading has already been assigned for the first day of class. It's the first day of class, and I'm already behind in my reading. Am I a psychic? Is my body supposed to be over- come with the feeling of \OOH I think I need to read chapter one and the preface.\ Well, I guess I seem to misread these messages as ''We'll probably just get the syllabus and be let out early.\ Erin, thanks for letting me share.

If you need something to run your eyes over while sitting in Dutch eating pizza, fine. I have no problems with that. But don't bring any highbrow ex- pectations into connection with all values Ameri- can. Thus my encounter with a Communist sandwich maker at West College. I simply asked for a, \smoked turkey on white with mustard, Mayo, lettuce. and (what else) American cheese.\ Not a very dif- ficult request, yet it unfolded into quite a fiasco. The first thing he and I asked him to put on the mustard and mayonnaise. It was at this point that I became acutely aware that this man probably was at one time a member of the Com- munist party. He not only slopped the mustard and Mayo on the same piece of bread, but it wasn't even on the bread itself, but on top of a piece of ice-berg lettuce. this thing, 'cause you might pull a hamstring or maybe something even worse, a brainstring. Sometimes in life the little things add up to more than the \Sometimes you notice the details more than the final project, and it is .my opinion that these moments of brief minute insight ate many time more valuable to the individual than the So my question to you is, who makes a sandwich like this? Who puts mustard and Mayo on the same side and only one piece of bread in big things. Some- times you notice the d.etails more than the final project, and it is my opinion that these moments of brief minute insight are many times more valuable to the indi- vidual than the more grandiose.

First of all, I am visceraly op- posed to a forced union of condi- ments. How could we possibly think that a sloppy blend of mus- tard and Mayo would work. You can't just throw them together like they were Yugoslavia. Condi- ments must be allowed to mix and intertwine of their own accord. Ah, but I digress. So he began to make my sand- wich and everything looked fine until he was about to close 'it up, the sandwich? The answer, no one does. We all know how to make a sandwich, yet this man at West had no due. None whatso- ever ever. 11ms I drew the obvi- ous conclusion that he must not be from our lovely country, but not only that, he must be from our nemesis- Russia. I don't really know what all this means, but I think we need a clean-up McCarthy style. We can't have people unfamiliar with American values making our food, otherwise who knows what's next?

Change Can be Positive for Political Science Department Consider A Japan or China Term To the Editor: f am writing in response to the article entitled \Turnover in the Political Scienee Department\ that G~.ppe:Jred in f/le- ( 'onoordien- · sis on February 2, 1995. The ar- ticle seemed to portray a negative viewpoint on some of the recent changes that have occurred in the Political Science Department. Every aspect of our world con- tains some elemet1t of change; and our education here at Union is no exception. As professor The Nichols comments in the article, some events such as deaths and promotions can not be avoided, and can in no way be predicted. Mor~ importantly, change should not be viewed as a negative oc- currence: sometimes we do change for the better. The first line of The Concor- diensis article reads: \In the past, the political science department at Union was esteemed to be one of the strongest departments in the college.\ What message is Graduate Management Institute invites students to attend an informational session on the Five-Year Joint BNBS- MBA Program Wednesday, February 22 3:30-4:30 p.m. Bailey Hall 308 Union's Joint 5-year BNBS-MBA Program allows students to complete both degrees in only one additional year of study.

President Hull writes in the January edition of Union College magazine that we do not know what jobs and positions will be in existence ten years from now; all students must learn amidst change and utilize their education in different and creative situations. The changes in the political science depart- ment, in my opinion, signal a re- sponsiveness to necessary change whether it is welcomed or not. Professor Nichols remarks that a challenge lies ahead in building a new political science depart- ment. I feel that this challenge is not only his, but especially the responsibility of every student interested in political science. Moreover, offering our views and opinions as students will allow us to use our education in creative ways when dealing with inevi- table change. The recent changes should not be met with pessimism, but rather optimism that the po- litical science department is willing to take on new challenges.

OPINIONS -~---...;.,.-.,. Aliens, Snow and Fraternities by Tony LaVecchia Assoc~ate ,()pinions Editor Well, I know you've all been worried sick, but the aliens have returned your faithful columnist. TI1ey did manage to gather a lot of information about Earth based on the extensive tests they ran on me. Needless to say they will not be returning any time soon. Well now that the Earth is safe from an alien threat and my roommate is safely locked away in a mental institution, I can write my col- umn. For those of you who missed my usual whining in last weeks column this paragraphs for you. I HATE TillS WEATIIER.It's not so much the cold that bothers me, it's not even the snow. Snow has a purpose, you can throw it, ski in it, if you're that hungry, you can even eat it. The wind, how- ever, is completely useless to me. Who does the wind help? When was the last time you saw a sign that says \Think wind\?- for any students interested in joining the Union Coalition Against the Wind, please don't contact me. Anyway, I suppose it hasn't been an altogether terrible week here at Union College. It's actu- ally been rather interesting. The bicentennial is quickly approach- ing. The Nott is almost finished. It does look rather majestic all lit up ·and with the. snow al.l around it. TI1e whole campus looks really beautifully covered with snow. It's unfortunate it's to cold out to really enjoy the beauty. Well, the fraternity rush sea- son has officially ended. Too bad, lkind ofliked the free food. Obviously, free food isn't the only thing that was important about rush. Forme at least,rush was a time to figure out where I would be spending the next three years of my life at Union College. Should I go Greek, and if so whete? Going in to rush I had a pretty good idea about where I wanted to end up, but I put all my preconceived notions aside and pretty much rushed everywhere. When all was said and done, I found the place that I felt comfortable, which is im- portant. Once rush was over, I got a bid and decided to accept it. I suppose I'd like to take this opportunity to defend fraterni- ties. I think they have an unfair reputation. Everyone has seen Animal House and heard all the horror stories about the evils of fraternities. I concede not every fraternity is \good nor is Greek life for everyone, but at least from my experience they can defi- nite}y(b,~ ,posi,tive. Fraternities have a .reputation .as heing someph.lce you carr go. fora tree (cheap!) beer. Although that is often true, they have other far more significant ben- efits. I .suppose what it boils down to is that a fraternity is simply a group of close friends who live to- gether and cooperate on all aspects of life. From this togetherness and common cause comes unity. It is this unity that is particularly spe- cial to me. This unity is what most people who talk negatively about fraterni- ties don't see, or choose not to rec- ognize. Speaking from my personal experience and the experience of others I've spoken to, a fraternity often provides the support system that one sometimes needs. I sup• pose that college is a confusing time by nature. Out of this confu- sion, one's character develops. So far I have looked to my older friends in fraternities for guidance during the hard parts of my times here. Their guidance has helped me out immensely. So I hope I've offered an alter- native viewpoint on fraternities. I certainly think they offer benefits to some. In no way am I trying to put down those who stay indepen- dent. It is obviously a personal, not to mention valid choice. Well study hard and prosper. All Letters to the Editor must be submitted on HD disk in Word for Windows 6.0 or lower along with a bard copy.

. ~ ~ . . SPORTS February 9, 1995, page 11 Track and Field Teams Bounce Back With Impressive Capital District Meet by Mike Leding Concordiensis Staff At this past weeke11d's Capital District Meet here at Union, the Women's and Men's Track and Field Teams fared far greater than th.ey did the past weekend at Hamilton. The team had a meet- . ' ing with Coaches LaiTy Cottrell andAldo Nardiello oil Friday and did some soul searching. It paid big clividends on Saturday as both the women and men teams had their biggest Indoor Track point · totals of the season. The women placed fourth out ofthe six teams with 56 points. The men placed third out of the six teams with 62 points,. seven points ahead of St. Rose, whom had defeated the men's team in the two previous meets. As usual, the top six p1aced in every event. For the women, Suzanne Johnson started off the scoring in the 20 lb. weight, placing fourth with a throw of 6,5 t: meters. In the long jutnp, Nadine 'Filosi and Tamara Saukin placed .second and third tespectively withjumps of 4.60 meters and 4.59 meters. In the shot put, Juli·e Finnan placed third with a throw of9.70 meters. h1 the 50 meter hurdles, Filosi placed first in a time of 8.31 seconds. In the triple jump, Tamara placed second in 9.65 meters, and Alison Gonyeau placed fourth in 8 .. 66 meters. Filosi placed once again in the 50 meter dash in a time of 6.9 sec- onds to finish third. Later, she placed fourth in the 800 meters in a time of 2:40A, thus round- ing out the women's scoring. For'the men, the 35 Jb. weight was a good start placing three men third through fifth. Jon Gainor placed third with. a throw of 12.41 meters, Rich Pulver Athletes of the Week by Mike Leding Concordie11sis Staff This week's athletes of the week are the Superman and Wonder woman of the running events for the Men's and Women's Track and Field teams. I refer to Nick Conway and Nadine Filosi as such because when they run they seem to pos- sesses superhuman powers. Nick is most likely the most in shape person in the school, he can place in any evet1t from the 400 meters to the 5000 meters. Nadine runs evetything from the 55 meters to the 800meters and usually scores half if not all of the women's team points. Nick, from Guilderland, N.Y., ran number one on Varsity Cross Country all fall and has brought that training with him over into the fall. This past weekend, af- ter a talk with Coach Larry Cottrell, Nick decided to run the I 000 meters, a race he had never run before. Nick had been run- ning the 1500 meter all season, and at a time of 4: I 4 he was just 5 seconds off qualifying for states in this event. Coach Cottrell de- cided the way Nick has been run- ning and with the ample amount of 1 seo meter runners the team has that Nick's. points woi.tld do the team betterin the 1000 meters, an:d that he would also have a chance of qualifying for states. The state quaJi;fying time is 2:39.0, at1d Nick ran a masterful race to place second in a time of 2:39.0, passing a few nmners at the very end to qualify for states. The I 000 meter on Union's in- door track is ·6 and 1/4 laps, not the best track to run this race on. After this race Nick rebounded nicely to nui the second fastest split on the 4x400 meter relay team that finished third. Nick is great evidence that persistence pays off. Just: a year ago it had seemed Nick had lost all his speed, and he was not too im- press~d with hj~ tit:_n~~ •. heJrained hard during the off season and during Cross Country and now is the most complete runner on the team. Nadine, from Stoneham MA., scored 28 of the women's 56 points this past Saturday at the Capital District Meet. Nadine has already qualified for the states in the 55 meter hurdles and dash. On Saturday Nadine competed in the Long Jump, 50 meter Dash, 50 meter Hurdles, and 800 meters. Nadine placed second in the long juinp with a leap of 4.60 meters; she is an inch off qualifying for states in this event. Next she competed in the 50 meter hurdles and placed first in a timeof8.3J-. seconds. Nadine ~hen placed third in the finals .ofthe 50 meter dash in a time of6.9 seconds, and one event later had enough stamina to run the five laps to place fourth in the 800 meter in a time of2:40.4. 1his is Nadine's senior year, she has been a top athlete i11 Division HI Women's Track and Field for four years now and has showed signs of improvement every year. Nadine is one of the more dedicated people to this program both on and off the track and deserves most, if not all, the credit for some of the things that the Track and Field teams have received the last four years. Nick and Nadine prove that with hard work one can improve no matter what state they might be in. Nick was not even half the runner last year that he is this year, and Nadine has stuck with this program for all four years and there are not many men or women who have done that here at Union. Swimming Teams Finish Regular Seasons Strong Colttbmedfrom page 11 title, and show Hamilton who the champions realty are. The men's meet greatly re- sembled the women's meet. Once again, they won every event, ex- cept the lOO Fly and the 1 00 Back. They finished first and sec- ond in six ofthese events. In two ofthese events, the 50 Backstroke and the 50 Breast, they captured first, second, and third. In the 50 Back, Mike Humphreys, Eric Majeron, and Jeff Fawcett out swam their opponents by a mar- gin .of two seconds. In the 50 Breast, Adam Levithan, Mark Anderson, and Matt Woodrow all swam under 32 seconds, which their opponents were not able to do. This was Adam Levithan's last meet of the season. Along with this evetit, he swam the 1 00 Breastroke in his best time this season. Other Dutchmen swam unusual events as well. Pete Spaulding, normally a freestyle sprinter, swam the 1 00 Fly, and came in fourth place. Scott Bowden swam the 100 Back plac- ing second behind a St. Lawrence swimmer. Mike Hmrtphreys, Chris Riley, and Eric Smith swam the 50 Fly, unusual swims for the first two. The abilities of the Union swimmers to swim differ- ent events than the norm, exem- plifies the !,'Teat capacity of this team. TI1ese capabilities will give them th(1 choices to create a win- ning line up for the state meet. Towards the end of the meet, TI1an Stuntz voluntarily swam the 400 IM, as the other competitors swam the 200 IM. He finished well, coming back and beating his one opponent who had a fair lead on him after the backstroke leg of the event. The exciting sec- tion of the meet came during the last event-the 200 Free Relay. Union has formed two equally powerful relays. One relay con- sists of Scott Bowden, Matt Glogowski, Chris Riley, and Kevin Makarowski. The other relay is comprised of Mike Darbyshire, Mark Anderson, Pe- ter Spaulding, and Mike Humphreys. The two relays fin- ished first and second. only 16 hundredths apart. Although the losing. team displayed their vocal abilities later on at a nearby res- taurant, they swam a very pow- erful swim. The men also swam the last two events exhibition, as to not run up the score. The final score came to 162-84. TI1is ends the Dutchmen's dual meet season. Both teams finish with a record of7-2. This is very impressive, considering some of the teams they were up against. They continue to prepare for States, both mentally and physi- cally. TI1e women count down the seven days until they begin racing. As stated in previous ar- ticles, the women desire this championship with a great inten- sity. They know they have the talent, but they will need to be performing at their best in order to win. l11e men have equal tal- ent, if not more. Although their state meet is set up differently, they will go after-Hamilton and Hartwick with an eve11 .greater appetite than in previous years. placed fourth with a throw of 10.35 meters, and Damon Bizzell placed fifth with a throw of.9.14 meters. In the Shot Put, Pulver placed first once again with a throw of 15.55 meters. In the triple jump, Mike Martin placed third with ajumpofll.67 meters. h1 the running events, Seth Rudin started the scoring by placing fifth in the 1500 meter in time 4:25.1. In the 400 meters, Mike Leding placed third in a time of 53.88, seconds and Brendan Sullivan placed fourth in a time of 55.18 seconds. h1 the 50 meter dash, Shuron Morton placed fourth in a time of 6.29, and Kojo Attah placed fifth in a time of 6.291. In the 1000 meters, Nick Conway placed second in a time of 2:39, qualifying himselffor states. Jay Goldberg placed fifth in the 3000 meters in a time of 9:37.6. The 4x400 meter relay team of Riggi, Conway, Sullivan, and Leding placed third in a time of 3:41 to round up the scoring. This was a much better effort than last weekend with almost everyone improving their times. Let's keep it together and work hard to prepare for HVCC in two 1 weeks and then for states. Union Hockey in lOth, Can Jump Several Spots This Weekend Continued from page 12 Albert slid a pass to defenseman Dean Goulet. Goulet's slapshot ricocheted off a Clarkson de- fender and into the net, for a 1-0 Dutchmen lead. Clarkson tied the score midway into the second pe- riod, while on the power play. Freshman goalie Trevor Koenig made some key saves during the second period, preservmg Union's 1-1 tie. The third period started off well for the Dutchmen, as they took a 2-1 lead less than two min- utes into the period. Sophomore John Sicinski received a pass from Chris Albert at center ice, and began to skate up the right side of the ice, into the Clarkson zone. As h'e drew the Clarkson defender towards him, Sicinski passed the puck to a wide open R.eid Simonton, who one-timed it passed Clarkson goalie Dan Murphy. However Simonton's goal, was the only high-point of the final period, as the Golden Knights preceded to score two consecutive goals .. Union's dis- cipline faltered in the final period, as the Dutchmen took three con- secutive penalties, subjecting themselves to the always danger- ous Clarkson power-play. The Golden Knights tied the game six minutes into the period, just as freshman Charlie Moxham stepped out of the penalty box. The most severe penalty of all, came with eight minutes remain- ing in the period. While the Dutchmen were already one man down, Cory Holbrough was pe- nalized for holding, giving the . Clarkson power play a one minute 5 on 3 advantage. TI1e Golden Knights capitalized on the situa- tion, taking a 3-2 lead, just as Union's first penalty had expired. Clarkson added a fourth goal, se- curing the victory before a crowd of 3,200. However the weekend was not a waste for the Dutchmen, as the following night they turned in the most convincing win in their division I history. Everything seemed to click against the Saints, as Union's of- fense, defense, and goaltending all contributed in the Dutchmen's 6- 0 victory. Union's offensive on- slaught began twelve minutes into the first period. Chris Albert banged home a loose puck in front of the Saint;s net, for his first of three goals on the night. Dean Goulet and Cory Holbrough re- ceived the assist on Albert's power play goal. TI1e Dutchmen added their second goal of the period, on an amazing individual effort by defenseman Reid Simonton. Simonton received a pass from Shane Holunga deep in his own zone. He then proceeded to skate through the entire Saints team, beating Saint Lawrence's stunned goaltender. Craig Reckin, who scored the only goal in last week· s 1-1 tie against Ver- mont, received the other assist. The Dutchmen took their 2-0 lead into the locker room, and came ~ut even stronger in the next two periods. Chris Albert recorded his sec- ond goal of the game and elev- enth of the season, extending Union's lead to 3-0. Linemate Cory Holbrough and defenseman Bill Moody received the assists on Albert's goal. Union's lead was preserved in the second period, as freshman goalie Trevor Koenig turned away all of the Saint's fif- teen second period shots. Union's offensive onslaught continued during the third period. John Sicinski, who has been playing his best hockey of the season, tallied his sixth goal of the season, on assists from Cory Holbrough and Chris Albert. Sicinski added another goal two minutes later; this time he re- ceived assists from Chris Albert and defenseman Scott Boyd. Albert capped off his phenomenal night, when he broke in on the St. Lawrence goaltender, and put the puck by him, for his second ca- reer hat trick. The 6-0 victory marked the first shutout in Union's division I history. In addition Trevor Koenig's 40-save performance earned him E.C.A.C. Rookie of the Week, and moved him into the league lead for goals against average, at 2.62. This weekend the Dutch- men will try to continue their climb up the E.C.A.C.ladder, fac- ing off against the Catamounts of Vermont and the Big Green of Dartmouth. Write for Sports JO·

Rick Lederer!Tite Co11cordiensis) Women's Hoop Rebounds With Win by Lee Schachter Associate Sports Editor The Union women's basket- ball team ended a tough skid on Monday by beating a solid Russell Sage team in exciting fashion. After a close game against Middlebury last week in which Union was edged out by three points, the Dutchwomen responded with a gutsy perfor- mance that came down to the wire. After jumping out to a quick I 2-4 lead, Union looked strong as they continued to play well and build the score to a 20-14 lead. However, Russell Sage stonned back with eight straight points and took a 22-20 lead. A series of steals on six consecu- tive plays- two by Deb Montano, two by Amy Hitz, and one each by Andrea Pagnozzi and Sara Gower- helped give Union a 28-22 lead. At half- time, though, the score was all tied up at 30. The Dutchwomen started the second half sluggishly, falling behind by a score of 47-40 af- ter a 17-10 run by Russell Sage. With seven minutes left, Union needed to make up a 55-48 defi- cit. Sparked by freshman Rachel Morgan's three-pointer, Union came stonning back with 12 straight points to take a 60- 55 lead with just three minutes left. One minute later, the lead had dwindled to two. Then with I :45 left, Rachel Morgan hit a pair of free throws. only to be followed by Russell Sage hit- ting a pair of free throws as well, and then getting the ball back with 17 seconds left with a chance to tie or win. But when they missed their chance and Union got the rebound, Marcie Heffernan was fouled and went to the line to shoot a l-and -1 with just 5 seconds left. She hit both, sealing the 64-60 victory for Union. . . It was a great game, with many impressive perfonnances turned in. Andrea Pagnozzi helped her 18 points-per-game average by scoring 20, followed by Amy Hitz who scored 19. Tanya Caparrello had 8, Rachel Morgan had 5, and Deb Montano, Marcie Heffernan, and Sara Gower each scored 4. It was a fantastic team effort overall. The Dutchwomen play their season finale at home against Skidmore on Saturday, Febru- ary 18th so be sure to come on up to the fieldhouse and support the team! ... Other B-ball news.

Preparation for the State cham- pionships have already begun, and this meet was an opportunity for the teams to improve their times and, therefore, ameliorate their seedings at the big meet in a couple of weeks. After a five hour bus ride, many pondered why in fact they have ventured up to this land of snow. Many swimmers were able to overcome this ride and compete with some !,'Teat finishes. One such swimmer was Jackie Crane who began the meet by winning the I 000 Free, with a season best time that broke the St. Lawrence pool record. Later, she swam the I 00 Free with a time of 55. 9, which will defiilitely put her in a position to score at States. The breastrokers once again swam with detennination. With the combination of Jenn Terrell, Megan McCarthy, Alyson McKee and Melissa Pomerleau, Union will prove to be the domi- nating team in the finals at States. On Saturday, Terrell and Pomerleau took l st and 2nd in the 50 and I 00 Breastroke. They were less than three tenths of a second apart in the 50, and a hun- dredth away in the 100. Several swimmers tested their abilities in different events than their nonn. Eri Hayashi swam the 50 Fly to add to her Jist of events. Jenn AlJaire swam the 500 Free in 5.26 .4 7, giving her another choice to add to her already strong list of events. Union won every event except the 50 Free, where they missed 1st place by three tenths of a second. They also got beaten by St. Lawrence in the I Meter diving. But in eight of the six- teen events, they captured first and second places. In two of these events, they dominated the field by finishing first, second, and third in the 100 Fly, swum by Mo O'Donnell, Megan McCarthy, and Kelly Jamieson, and the 500 Free. Alyson McKee swam this event exhibition but, had she swam for points she would have placed a close fifth. Jenn Allaire, Annie Rozwadowski, and Karen Watts defeated St. Lawrence by a land slide in the 500 Free, leaving them twelve seconds behind. After the 50 Fly, the score was climbing too high, and coach Bassett decided to swim the rest of the meet exhibition to try to close the point gap between tl1e two teams. Nevertheless, Union still continued to win events. In the 200 IM, Flo Chretien, CeCe Buchanan, and Erica Saltz fin- ished first, third and fourth. nle final score of the women's meet came to 170-110. Being the last meet of the dual meet season, it ended on a high note.

Last Monday a rally was held outside the Col- I ege Center to educate the student body about the how these cuts will affect them. Kate Duropherofthe Womyn's Student Union, acting under the umbrella group of Campus Ac- tion stressed, \These proposed cuts will affect everyone, not just students on financial aid.\ Cur- rently there are over 1,200 stu- dents receiving financial aid from \ source other than the College. TI1e College has promised to meet . every student's financial needs once they are enrolled in the Union academic program. Tu- ition will have to be raised sig- nificantly for the whole student body in order to make up for the absent funds financial aid usually makes available. Michael Brown, Director of Financial Aid, explained that if the aid is cut, the College will have to pick up the rest of the bill in erder to continue to meet the students' needs. \I don't believe that the College can pick up the difference [of the absent loans] for an extended period of time,\ Brown said. \Students will be expected to take out more loans The Cuts:.

Presently, there are400 Union students enrolled in TAP and 51 students in HEOP. This will result in the loss of over $180,000 in aid next year. It is especially tragic that the state is considering cutting the HEOP because Union has had such a great success rate with the program. The HEOP assists aca- demically and financi'ally disad- vantaged students realize their goals of obtaining a higher edu- cation. Union has had an unprec- edented success with this program by gradtlating almost everyone they have enrolled through it. The federal aid that is under the threat of elimination are the Pell Grant, the Supplemental Educa- tional Opportunity Grant (SEOG), and the Perkins Loan. There are currently 320 Union students receiving the Pell Grant, 300 students have been awarded the SEOG and 140 students are currently receiving the Perkins Loan. TI1is translates into roughly one million dollars in loan money that would be lost in the year fol- lowing the elimination of these programs. That is one million dollars that full paying students would have to make up for - tu- ition dollars would be forced to mcrease. President Hull and Ethel David, the head of the AOP, were two of the people to address the students at the rally on Monday. TI1ey pre- sented facts on how the aid cuts would affect all students and en- couraged them to take action against these cuts. All who spoke promoted a rally that was held in Albany the next day. Union Student, Fei-lu Qian at- tended the Albany rally with over twenty other Union students.

Masi's murder and the gradual increase il1 crime in the city. Vito A. Masi, a23 year oldman was murdered on Januaryl3, 1995 on Hattie St. in Schenectady. Some city citizens are advocating that a memorial center be built in his honor. As of 1992 the number of mur- ders reported in New York State was 2,378.

February 16, 1995, page 4 NEWS . ' ' . Student Forum Election: Junior Class Representative Kate Hedgeman Dear Friends, I have decided to once again nm for the position of Juniorrep- resentative. I want to be on the student forum because I actually want to find out what the hell is really going on heFe at Union and why we try to accomplish every- thing instead of focusing on a few goals at a time. Nothing ever seems to get accomplished with the current approach. Some time ago, when Union was having se- vere security problems, myself and some other students on the forum hoped to establish a walk- ing escmt system and other safety guidelines. However, I was told to put my ideas in writing and that the student forum would handle it. Did they? NO. In addition to this request, there are many other problems which need attending to. Ifl am elected I really hope that I and the other members of the forum can ac- complish something for you the students. I believe that we have so much power that is being har- nessed by something or someone. If elected, I hope to find the source of repression and stand against it. Does the Student Fo- rum have a significant amount of power, or is it just a fonnality es- tablished by the administration to create legitimacy for itself? By electing people lil<e myself, you would be voting to,change the system, not complying to a popu- larity contest. I care about U, and so should you. Vote for Kate Hedgeman on Friday February seventeenth. Jon Klein The position of student forum representative for the junior class entails a great amount of duties and responsibilities.. As a repre- sentative of the public, one mt~st be in close contact with the stH- dent body and a strong sense of trust must be established: There- fore, the ability to communicate and transmit one's ideas, views, and opinions directly to the rep- resentative is a vital role in repre- sentation. I am the man for this job! My ability to discuss and con- verse with you, the class of 1996; is extremely significant for this position of junior class represen- tative. As a junior at a small school at Union, most people al- ready know what kind of person I am and what I stand for. For those that do not know me, I am a tmeand honest person. My best ability is to relate to, and under- stand the people. As a result, I will not mumble and jumble on about all the fabrication about cl1ange and refonn in the Student Fonnn, but win use this as a chance for the juniors to get acquainted with me and what I can offer. As a representative, I wi1l do .

S~AY YES TO THE MAN WITH THE PLAN, SAY YES TOJON KLEIN. ON FRIDAY, THE/7! Bill Ferguson Greetings. I am Bill Ferguson and I am running for Junior Class Representative. I appreciate the opportunity to address the Junior Class about some issues that I feel are important when you, my fel- lGw classmates, go to the polls on Friday. My issues are not as ap- pealing or exciting as if I pledged free booze, free sex, and free drugs and had them distributed throughout the Union College community. No, unfortunately, l will not promise the sky as my opponents may, my issues are more of a sobering type: your right to know and a watchdog over the Student F:omm' s budget. First, have you ever wondered what the Student Forum was do- ing? I believe that the most im- portant function of an elected rep- resentative, at any level, isto keep those whom they represent in- formed about what the body they serve in is doing. I 'have always wondered what the Student Fo- rum did, what they dealt with, what issues they addressed; and to get right down to it, how th~y served me and the student body. I have never heard from any member of the Student Forum, whetherthat be my own class rep- resentative, or the Student Fomm's Officers. I have never heard any issue, proposal, or any- thing that came up, that was ad- dressed, whether tl1e thing passed or failed, or for that matter, whether this body called the Stu- dent Fonun even met. The only time I or you ever heard from any of these people was when it was time again for them to run for re- election. Now, this is not howl think the Student Farum or any other representative boqy should be run. This is why I feel, and promise, ifl am elected as Junior Representative, that I willpttblish a newsletter, personally, report- ing to you the business and deci- sions done by the Student Fomm. This, I believe is fundamental for a well-informed commtmity and for open and responsive govem- ment. Second, I pledge to be a watch- dog when it comes to Student Foni~ finances. Did you know the Student Fonun has over a300, 000 dollar yearly budget? Did you ever wonder where all this money goes? Have you fe1t the benefit of your fair share of this money? Could that be because this money is not being spent wisely? I feel that our money the Student Fonun allocates could be spent more wisely. This does not necessarily mean less, but rather how the Student Forum allocates this money. Let me explain. The procedure in which the Student Fomm follows when allocating funds leads to irresponsible spending. .For example, the Fo- rum allocates Club X, $1000. Toward the end of the school year, Club X realizes that all its expenses have been covered, but they still have $200. Normally, Club X would tum back the $200, which would then be reallocated the next year for speakers, for WRUC, for the Concordiensis, or for anything. But, what currently happens is when a club turns in extra money, their budget is cut that amount the following year, the Forum believing that the club must not need that much. Unfor- tunately, as a result, the clubs have noticed this pattem by the Forum, and rather then tum in money not spent, they spend any extra money they have on things that may not be necessary, to avoid a cut the.next year. This downward spiral of wasteful spending and bad allocatiHg prac- tices must be stopped for the fis- cal health and bettel111ent of the Student FoTQm. I promise to -be that watchdog. I :pr.omise to bring you the tom material from the trousers of any person or gr.oup. who I find to be following such irresponsible spending habits. I will propase and advocate a new procedure for funding clubs which will yield fiscal responsi- bility, so that money Qan be saved for those other clubs and pro- grams that we could aU enjoy. I hope tl1at you feel as I do, that the issues I have covered are im- portant enough to warrant your support. Thank you and I look forward to your support on Elec- tion Day. Noa Kaldes · Hi my name is Noa Kaldes aJ)d I would like to ask you a ques- tion. Have you ever heard a Union student complain about campus life? Of course you have. Now let me ask you another ques- tion. Have you ever heard a Union student offer a positive suggestion as to how to improve it? You probably have to think a little harder, don't you. It is my experience that the majority of the student body is unhappy with some aspect of student life, yet only a handful of students take the time to get involved. Recently I have come to realize that the small minority of students who partake in student govemmeilt are the same individuals involved in most of the other campus wide organizations. I must admit that I have spent most of my first two and a half years at Union in the majority, but I would like to \switch roles\ by taking this op- portunity to run for the junior class representative. It is never too late to get involved and I don't believe that 011e has to be incred- ibly experienced to do so. I feel that I understand many of the problems that exist at Union and would like to lend my time and energy into solving them. Union is not only an institution that is supposed to prepwe us for the real world, but it is also our home for four years. Therefortt, it is ben- eficial to no one to assume a pas- sive role while we are here. It is for this reason that I atn running for junior class representative and hope for your vote. · Death Penalty Debated Contbmed ftom page I tmustlal punishment. The debate ended with no vic- tor.

' ' WORLD NEWS Feb~ua.ry J(), 1995, page 5 Today's Valiant Fight Against Terrorism by Matt Sandler Concordien$/s Staff Two years after the February 26, 1993, WorldTradeCenterter- rorist bombing that killed six people and injured over a thou- sand, American authorities have captured who they consider to be the mastermind behind that at- tack. His name-Ramzi Ahmed Y ousef. Hewas the one who pur- chased the chemical~, oversaw the construction ofthe car bomb, and was responsible for recruit- ing other Muslims to aid in the conspiracy. He is considered to or James Bond intrigue that caught Mr. Yousef's where- abouts. It was an informer who was probably recruited in Paid- stan by Mr. Yousef, who walked into the American Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, and told the State Department Security Ser- vice that Mr. Yousef would be arriving soon frem Bangkok. Naseerullah Khan Babar, the Pa- kistani Interior Minister, told re,.. porters that ~hen the suspect ar- rived on Sunday, he was placed under surveillance, until his arrest on Tuesday. A team ofPakistani and American officials, who were or an American airliner, and in Titailand to a failed car bomb at- tack at the Israeli Embassy. America has been the victim of terrorism and lms, under Carter and Reagan, developed highly skilled Commando Counter-Ter- rorist forces. The 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment- Delta (Delta Force} and .the Navy Sea Air Land Commandos, SEAL Team 6 (Aithot!gh, a lot different from the Hollywood movies) have developed to combat ·terror- ism, like the British Special Air Service (SAS), Gennany ~ s GSG- 9, the French GIGN, and the Is- be a professional ter- ~----------~---~----- raeli Sayeret Mat'kal.

The Tom a• hawks did not penetrate that stronghold. The attack was meant to punish with the mini- mum loss of life. American authorities at the Federal B ttreau of Investigation, the domestic investigating arm responsible for counter-intelli- gence, placed Mr. Yousef on its most wanted list 1 and also on Interpol Red Notice, ~n intema- tional watch list of crimi.nals.

He pleaded not guilty, four defen- dants c.onvicted already in the World Trade Center bombing re- ceived 240 years, Mr. Y ousef could have a stiffer sentence. An international investigation is be- ing launched to link Mr. Y ousef activities to failed terrorist plots in the Philippines against the Pope to optimize sue- cess. Jhe United States also has the capabilities of the Federal Bt1reau of Investigation (domes- tic) and the Central Intelligence Agency (outside U.S.) to track down terrorists. The U.S. has been attacked by Iran when Ira- nian revoh,1.tionaries seized the Embassy in Tehran in 1 979 ~ ter- rorism in Beirut by car bomb at- tacks on the Embassy and Marine Barracks; the kidnapping of A.lner~can citizen~ such as Terry Anderson and others,-,holding them for years as hostages; the Achille Lauro hijacking and mur- der of.elderly, wheelchaired Leon Klinghoffer; the Libyan bomb- ing of Disco in \Berlin killing three American servicemen; to Pain Am 103 explosion over Scotland, and the Wor1d Trade Center bombing, and plan to blow up the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and attack the United Nations build- ing and assassination of one Sena- tor in Congress and other leaders in New York. America attempted to rescue the hostages in Iran on April 24, 1980, known as Operation \Eagle Claw.\ As a result of poor func- tioning aged helicopters, one of which was forced to be aban- doned and two others retumed to the U.S.S. Nimit2. Colonel Charles A. Beckwith consulting with Carter exercised his judg- ment to abort saying he needed six helicopters and he only had five at Desert One. It was when they were leaving that a helicop- ter collided with a transport plane ending in the fiery crash and de- bacle. Iran did not know what happened until Carter told the world the next day. He feared that the Iranians would kill the terror- ists if he did not tell the world first. On April 26, 1980 Opera- tions \Snowbird\ and \Honey Badger\ were developed for the second planned rescue attempt, nothing became of these plans. We have attacked Qaddafi's home and Iraqi's Intelligence Ser- vice in response to terrorism, and have even tried to negotiate anns for hostages. We have sent Delta Force to Beirut trying to find the hostages, but could not locate them. The Embassy and the Ma- line Barracks in Beimt could have beeil saved, A reduced platoon formed by our counter-i ntelli- getlce and terrorism forces. They have met with success and fail- ure, Inost tiines it is not the pro- fessionals but the incoherent policy that they have to fol'low that dooms them to failure. For instance in 1985, TWA flight 847 was l1ijacked and flown to Algiers, Delta Force was unable .to attempt the rescue because Al- gerian authorities kepthttge lights on the runway. 'To overcome these obstacles American intelligence and counterterrorist forces must work :in close consultation and coopera- tion with other nations to provide intelligence watch on terrorist training and the movement of sus~ pected terrorist individuals and ·groups. The intemational com- munity must put pressure on na- tions that continue to fund and support terrorism through aid car- gos wl1en there is progress of cur- tailing terrorism and sanctions if they do not. Just as the United States pre-positions equipment, troops, and bases abroad to fight our enemies, so to must we have officials and forces to fight tcr- roris~n abroad.

They called back to the States and a gizmo was de- veloped to atta.chto the Embassy and the Marine Banacks which would have sent out the known frequencies used to detonate a car bomb before it ever reached its destination. The Ambassador re- fused arguing that this device would cause unnecessary loss of life to the civilians. There is not enough room to elaborate more on these and other endeavors per- because the enemy is an urban guerrilla terrorist in this ''Jihad\ against the West and Israel. The rule that nations must never break is to negotciate with terrorists groups, that does not deter, but increases the ·chances for more . terrorism. After the recent sui- cide bombings in Israel, President Clinton moved to freeze the money flowing from the United States to groups such as Hamas and otl1er tenorist organizations. This is the right step in an inter- national effort to fight terrorism. President Clinton's Budget Proposal for Next Year by Marc Foster Concordieilsis Staff Earlier this 'month, the White House released its proposed fed- eral budget for 1996. It shows an increase in the deficit of almost $197 billion, more tha11 $4 billion than this year's deficit. Broken down, the president's budget looks like this: military spend- ing ($262 billion/16%), Social Security ($351 billion/22%), Medicare and Medicaid ($271 billion/17%), interest on the fed- eral debt ($257 billion/16%), for- eign aid ($21 billion/1.3%), do- mestic programs and other entitle- ments like welfare and food stamps ($450 billion/28%). Nondiscretionary spending ac- counts for two-thirds of the fed~ era! budget, leaving cuts to only defense and some domestic spending in order to reduce the budget deficit. Currently, the na- tional debt stands at $3 .5 tril- Hon-$14,000 for every A.meri- can. A balanced budget is not achievable without cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. On Capitol Hill, the President's budget was thought to be D.O.A., given the first Republican-con- trolled Congress in 40 years. The White House offered vague and scattered proposals on tax breaks and spending cuts, all likely to be modified by the Republicans who won control on a pledge to reduce the size of government and cut the federal deficit. TI1e White House aims to cari-- cature the presidetlt as a defender of middle-class values by distort- ing Republican efforts for more program cuts and reducing the capital gains tax as favoring the rich. Tlie President's ''Middle Class Bill ofRights\ includes new tax credits for children and a de- duction for college tuition at a cost of $63 billion over five years. Meanwhile, plans were out- lined for the reorganization of the energy and transportation depart- ments and the General Services Administration, with staff cuts proposed for the Office of Person- nel Management. The Depart- ment of Housing and Urban De- velopment would merge 60 pro- grams into eight worth $26 bil- lion. And for education, the presi- dent proposed that by 1997, the governme11t would make loans directly to college students, sav- ing $5 billion over five years in fees paid to commercial banks and private lenders. TI1is budget guarantees deficits of $200 billion well beyond the year 2000. With Medicare and Medicaid expected to grow at a rate faster than consumer prices overall, and cuts not expected in the foreseeable future, the na- tional debt will continue to deepen. By the start of the next century, almost all federal outlays will be in the fonn ofentitlements and other nondiscretionary spend- ing. Though not a pa11acea, the Republican-backed Balanced Budget Amendment will incorpo- rate some sense of discipline into the badget making process. Simi- larly, the House passed .the line- item veto last week, enabling the president to exercise far-reaching powers over the federal outlays by blocking the pork-barrel spending that has contributed to the growth of the national debt. Elections for Editor-in-chief of The Concordiensis will be held next week 011 Tuesday, February 21st at 6:00PM. All Current Staff members are eligible to vote and are required to attend the meeting to discuss section editorships.

February 16, 1995. page 6 LIVING with AI Shapiro The Divinity of a Letter \Beulah Peel Me A Grape'' The art of correspondence is an affair of cerebral int~macy and a celebration of the power of lan- guage. In a life of ephemeral pleasures set against what often seems an indifferent, if not soul- munchingly cruel, world where even our own memories contort and eventually slip away, the handwritten letter remains a stronghold. and a defender, of the expressionm-y m1s. The raw poetics of setting pen to paper, creating and giving per- sonal meaning to what was before only blank, dripping ink into the emptiness, set letter writing apart from the more mundane fonns of communication. Imagine if the founding fathers of the United States had access to Ma Bell and decided to just caH up England to declare our inde- pendence:. \Hello this is TI1omas Jefferson. Some friends and I are over here in Amerka~ and we've been thinking ... \ isms need leave the desk. The writer may never even decide to send the letter, just having writ- ten it could be enough. Letters oflove, letters of anger, letters ofhumor, letters that broke down walls, letters to look at, let- ters that still somehow carry a little hint of scent, letters written in youth and progressive matu- rity, letters written in blood: ev- erything from the design and tex- ture of the paper it is written on to the slant of someone else's pen- manship adds to the aura of this compelling agei1cy. Think of the confusion that would be avoided if writing were more popular a medium between \friends and family.\ Tl1e fool restlessly waiting on the wrong block for his love might easily have made reference to the letter that said, \the comer of Prince and Broadway, ten o'clock,\ and not have gotten soaked in the rain. Tl~is is not to say that the con~ venient simplicity and immediacy of the telephone doesn't have its strong points as well. Calling enables two (or however many with the adve,nt-9fthe 'party-line.' . option) people to convey quick infonnation that sometimes can't wait. Changes in plans, new de-. velopments, needful things that go bump in the night. No-one writes to Domino's late-night. Some things necessitate a phone. from the past, present, and future all conspire in .a marriage of sound. Consider though how imposing the phone can be; in- tense thought and conversation being interrupted by wrong num- bers and credit card salespeople, people of authority and disciplin- ary power calling at inopportune moments, the phone bill itself, prank calls, all ar~ costs .of main- taining a line. Letters are unim- posing; even the ones that come same day express will sit in d1e mail box, until you check it. Af- ter receiving mail too, you can read it all at once, a little at a time, or not open it for ten years- it's all left to your discretion.. The whole process is based on the re- spect of choice. Letters require a level of thoughtfulness that the phone (and to an extent e-mail) does not generally require. The rapid and fleeting exchanges that take place over the telephone ~lose their power and fade away into obscure recollection as soon as it's re- t• ., :;:.,_ .. turned to its cradle. Recogni:zing that the written word.carries a more potent burden than that of the spoken word, a more consid- ered craft is called on. Me1nories of childhood / phonecalls are few, and those that remain are far from complete, but letters from relatives long since passed away or even from friends from the past are still deeply re- warding and precious. Letters can live forever; they continue a thought or einotion throughout eternity. Whether receiving, creating, reminiscing over, or btin1ing let- ters: the whole game is refresh- mg. Start one today, my friend. AI Shapiro .1('.· /\•. \r ·1 F- . '-' ' -~ f -~ A letter provides its authm the fullest range of expressionary freedom.

FEATURES February 16, 1995, page 7 Requires a Little Craziness: We Care about U-Schenectady by William Rice Concordiensfs Staff It requires a little hit of crazi- ness to wake up early enough to be at the College Center at 9 AM on a Saturday morning. U1is is where a dozen students gathered to pile into cars and a school van to travel to 933 De lamont A v- enue. This is the destination of a house purchased by Better Neigh- borhoods. 'hlc., a private organi- zation devoted to buying de- pressed properties, rebuilding them, and selling them back to families that wish to purchase a home of their own. This non- profit O!\ganization must sell the homes at the lowest cost possible so they rely on the assistance of volunteer work to rebuild the homes. That's where Union Col- lege students fit into the picture. This past week, I decided join this crew to find out what We Care about U-Schenectady. is all about. The first question that must be asked ofthe members is: \Why do you wake up so early on a Saturday moming and spend half 9f the day working?.\ . The responses .are generally the same tluoughout the membership, Carol Case, a sophomore math major says that \It makes me feel ·good to d0 something to help oth- ers.\ Rocco Giovanni, a scipho• more industrial econoinics 1rtajor says: ''I feel good ·doing some- thing constructive and being able to walk away from .a project and say, 'I did thatJ\ The studen~s sense a feeling of ac.complish- ment in doing coi1structive work with others. TI1is is an opportu- nity for many to work on some- thing and see a tme physical re- sult. Seth. Condel'l, the student foremai1 says: \I like to get out- amount of patience. He says that the more time he spends working with the students, and having fun, the less time he spends at his other job.

Upon reach- ing the house, students meet Fred Romano: Fred is an employee of the city of Schenectady and has years pfexperience in rebuilding houses. Fred enjoys working with students and has att incredible accomplished a.s well as showing how the job must be done . Club President John Arzberger recalls his experiences: \I. joined We Care about U- Schenectady because it was fun to swing a hamn'ler, the more I went, the more skills I learned and the more skills I was able to retain for the rest of my life. I enjoy teaching new students these skills that I on-site such as demolition, fram- ing, flooring, sheetrocking, and painting. Everything associated with building a house, things that each person may encounter later in life when they may need to do work on their own home. To date, the club has completed four houses, the most recent 011e saved BNI roughly five to seven thou- sand dollars on the final cost. When the club was founded, it consisted of mostly civil engi- neers. TI1e club now has mem- bers from nearly every discipline. It provides a good atmosphere to work and get to know other stu- dents you woul:dn 't normally have a class with. Some of the regular members of the club have become experi- enced in construction and are ready to show people what needs to be done. No orders are given here, just a laid back atmosphere that gives everyone a smile on their face after a day of work. Even a lunch is provided for all. Orders are taken for meals at McDonald's and Brueger's. It usually comes when you just start to get hungry and a little bit tired. Lunch is eaten together and sto- lies are shared about what hap- pened this moming or last night. I enjoyed working on the house this Saturday.

Features Editor It seemed like an ordinary Fri- day aftemoon,. My colleagues and I headed down to Rupsi's fer our weekly \Literary Society\ meeting where we discuss prose over a couple of pitchers of Genny like the intellectuals we are. Nonnally the tavem consists of only ourselves, our professor (some might call him our \leader\), and a few locals on a Friday, but as you are about to leam, this wasn't to be your av~ erage aftemoon. It has occurred to me over the past few weeks that various Union College faculty members have been infiJt.rating i11to this Friday aften1oon routine. It was subtle .at first, one or two sitting at opposite ends of the table, blending in so not as to disturb the delicate balance of the well~ trained minds to those still in trainit1g. But as I said, something was different this time. At one point I ~looked around me and found I was surrounded with pro- fessors. To my l~ft a!ld.right, in front and in back. Professors with scotch. Professors with beer. Professors with vodka. Now, I know this shouldn't have come as a shock to me. Pro- fessors are just J.ike you and me, after all. Of course, pr,ofessors drink. ·Why shouldn '( they? I mean, if I were them I'd be at Rupsi's every night let alone Fri- day. There we were, a \Union\ if you will, of students· and fac- ulty shruing cocktails and anec- dote·s on life and academia, no longer divided by desks and chalkboards, hut as equals. It was just like w1mt everyone always said about going to a small col- lege, ''Your professors will be your friends.\ I guess they for- got the part about drinking bud- dies. Time passes, and a few get up to dance. Not students- profes- sors. Rupsi's doesn't have a dance floor, bl1t they managed to make one. They were dancing on chairs and tables, swinging each other arm111d madly. Back flips and break-dat1ch1g, these profs were cutting lo0se, I just watched in awe.

We weren't expecting anyone else, so Iran to the door eager to see who could pos~ibly be on the other side. I opened it and a woman practicruly toppled upon me. Her face registered shock when she realized that I was not the owner of the apartment. \Isn't the party here?\ she asked. . Before I could answer a herd of professors come streaming through the door. I looked outside to see ifthere were any more, and spied a lone figure lying in a snow bank. I assisted him in regaining his footing, and showed him the way upstairs so he could join the rest of his friends. What had started as an intimate gathering had just become a full~blown party. These professors had no use for prayer. The lights went on and the music was blaring. TI1ere were professors on the stairs, profes- sors in the refrigerator, professors passed out on the couch, and yes- professors dancing once again. Somehow we convinced some of them that I was a wealthy social- ite from Rhode Island who was dating one . of my professors, while another student was his ex- wife. Who knew fooling them could be so easy? Once they realized there wasn't any alcohol 1 at our little shit1-dig the enthusiasm started to dwindle. \You guys are lame, man,\ scoffed one, as another held her up, \We're going to find a real party!\ And with that they scooped up the ,mconscious one from the couch and headed for the door. \And I thought Union stu ... dents were supposed to be big drinkers,\. I overheard one of thetn saying as they walked down the stairs. So did I. But we obvi- ously still have a lot to leam from our professors .

Normalizing Gay & Lesbian Love To the Editor, I rarely wat.ch televisio11, but I decided to take a night off last Monday (2/6) in order to check out Sen•ing in Silence, N.B.C. 's movie-adaptation of Colonel Margarethe Cammermeyer's 'di schargicus homophobicus' from the U.S. Army/National Guard. She had served 30 full years when she was 'honorably' discharged for being a lesbian. Few people realize that she fought AND WON an appeal against that decision and is cur- rently serving. Go girl! It's too bad that the media doesn't find l1IA T story as interesting. For- tunately, Barbara Streisand, Glenn Close and some others do, and were brave enough, or per- hapsjust motivated enough, to put her story on film. TI1ey did a fan- tastic job. Unlike the great film Philadel- phia, the star and her lover acht- ally kiss, ... on the lips! Yes! That was truly a failing in the fonner, as it was difficult to believe or understand the love between Tom Hanks' character and his lover precisely because the di-rector avoided filming physically inti- mate scenes, ... scenes that are cru- cial to make the love-relationship believable to the viewer. The normalizing of homo- sexual sexual expression reminds me of the nonnalizing of married couples' sharing of the same bed! Remember the old movies and television shows where the mother and father had separate twin beds? In hindsight, it seems silly. It certainly wasn't true for most. So, why pretend that gay and lesbian couples don't kiss or hold hands or sleep together? It seems silly. It certainly isn't true. The sooner we get gay and les- bian physical/sexual intimacy out of the 'porno' category and into the 'twnnal' category (where it belongs), the sooner we as a so- ciety can hold our heads up a little higher when we boast \liberty for all.\ Besides, the sooner people gets used to it, the sooner I can kiss my girlfriend in public and know that my racing heart is from love and not from fear of being harassed! -Union Student (femina bi-sexus) OP-ED- . . -_: _·- .: ·· .. ·_ -· ·. _. .EDlTORIAL . . ·. -,.

Author Corrects Inaccuracies In Articles To the Editor, Two weeks ago I wrote an ar- tiCle for the Concordiensis, titled \Union Mourns Loss of Great Scholar.\ It was about the death of Professor Daniel Robbins of . the Visual Arts Department. I wrote the article because I work at the Arts Department, and I watched the affect his lose had 011 the staff there. I was very wor- ried that I would get some fact wrong, or miss quote one of the professors I work with everyday. TI1ey had all been very helpful and open with me about Profes- The Correct Story About Political Science Department To the Editor, I am writing in response to John Vera's letter last week which commented on the article \Tum- over In The Political Science De- partment\ written by Michelle Ellis. Apparently, Ms. Ellis was attempting to report on the tum- over of professors in the Political Science department. Vero claimed that he sensed some nega- tivity in her article, and perhaps there was some negativity in the article that has gone unexplained. While I commend Ms. Ellis and Mr. Vero for their concern and comments, I believe it is finally time to set the record straight. It has been established that the Editorials, Letters & Disclaimers department is chm1ging, and that change is good. I agree with both statements, however, in both ar- ticles the major concem of politi- cal science students has been overlooked. You see, between the influx of new faculty, and the number of set1ior professors on sabbatical or leave, many prob- lems have been created. The most important concem that ma- jors, especially members of the crass of 1996, have is that a visit- ing professor position may be eliminated. The position may be eliminated because there is not enough money to cover a salary and cover the salaries of the Sr. professors who are on sabbatical next year. Our complaint is that, we are paying for a professor who may not teach next year nor ad- vise thesis students. On the other hand, we could have a Visiting Professor, who is willing to teach two courses a tenn and advise thesis students as well. The Po- litical Science Department needs a visiting professor, if Sharlet does not retum or it wi II be short- handed. sor Robbins. I tried to be as care- ful as possible, but, as my room- mate assured me, the edi.tots would catch any· mistakes. The next day the paper came out. I didn't even want to tead the ar- ticle, but I checked to make sure it was in there. I felt OK ab6ut it all and went on with my day. When I ran into my roommate later that evening she asked tne if I wm1ted to know the \bad news.\ l11e bad news was that· the first sentence of the article said \Pro- fessor Daniel Robbins died Sat- urday, February 14 ... \ Not only isFebruaty 14 not a Saturday, but it also meant that at the time the article. was published, Professor Robbins hadn't died yet. That was not the oi1ly mistake in the at1icle, but it was the one that stood out the most to me. I know it was my responsibility to check my work, and I did read it over several times, but I never even thought about February vs. January. I can't take all the blame on my- self, so I will mention that the Concordiensis should watch what it publishes. This is a Yety pretty paper on the outside, but if you sit down and read anything other then Uncle Edl1a, you see that that is about all it has to offer. I would like to apologize to the Professors at the Arts Departments, and any- one else who read ~:ny artic.le, for the mistakes, and I hope I catch any that are in this letter.

An AK-47 assault rifle was the weapon of choice. Vito was 23 years old) Who killed Vito Masi? Cer- tainly the boy who pulled the trig- ger gets most of tl1e blame. But perhaps all of us helpeq pull the trigger because of our shared in- giffetence to the violence that surrounds us. We tum away and go on with our lives because we think it doesn't affect tiS person- ally-as if it call never happen to us. It just happens 'over there,' to other people. All that changes whe_n someone you love is mur- dered. TI1e unanswerable hows and whys are overwhelming. Vito's family and my son, who loved Vito like a brother, will never be the same without him. l11e murder is personal to us, and we want to know how and why. We are all accountable for Vito's death-from the person who pulled the trigger, to a country and gov- · ennnent that have become so im- mune and myopic to the sights and sounds of the killing on our streets that Vito's death will be shortly forgotten. We have come to accept all the violence in the media and the facts and figures thrown at us by the National Rifle Association. l11ose of us who are afraid stick our heads in the sand, and the rest of us are buying guns.

Since Vito's death, however, I will question the loyalty of an entire block of legislators (approximately 28 from the November 1994 elec- tion alone) who owe their alle- giance to the gun manufacturers who pay for their election cam- paigns. Who will have their loy- alty in Congress-individual citi- zens or the NRA? How do the NRA legislators and lobbyist ex- plain the murder statistics in this countly as compared to European countries.

Unfortunately, (for us) the equation is simply-more gun sales equal greater profits. Gun sellers are as interested in our constitutional rights as the ciga- rette industry is in our good health. That we have relinquished the loyalty of our elected officials to special interest groups like the NRA, is not the fault oft he NRA. It is our own. It is what helped kill Vito Masi, and why I will no longer be immune, nor will I ever again be indifferent to the chaos around me. Sincerely, Livia Carroll

What most of you have prob- ably forgotten is her very 80's role on Aaron Spelling's \Dynasty\. Remember when there was Dynasty versus Dallas ? Today its Melrose versus Beverly Hills 902 I 0. Either way, Heather Locklear, TV's \reigning blond\ plays a bitch in botl1 shows.

We don't have to dress any way, we don't have to put on any bull shit attitude and pretend like we're pa1t of some larger movement. It's a very easy situation for us on an artistic level. A lot ofbands, have early success and huge road blocks come up in their careers. We've been able to forgo a lot of that stuff and I feel like that's been pretty fortunate. I think in some ways we were lucky that we didn't have some big break away Top 40 hit that would always dog us I remember I was in this club in NY and I ran into this guy who I ·. . . ·' pt;:Qp)e have, ask~p ,us ,what_ y.'C. thought of the .~~one Ro.-.·e., and having never l}eard them we said we had no opinion on them.

I've heard one song once at a friend of mine's house and that's pretty much the extent of it. It's a funny world you know, I'm pretty out of the general scene at this point, I'm into the mllsic that I'm into, I'm not that curious about Top 40 bands. Bands that are just minding the current thing. I love guitar bands but I'm pretty sick of white guys with guitars. CD Review: Another Disappointment by Jody Mousseau Co11cordiensis Staff Portishead, and even the Ass Ponys, have something to offer the world of music, in which the magnitude oftalent is often ques- tionable. l can't say the same for Spell and dEUS. SpeU's release \Mississippi\ was not impressive. Tracks en- titled \straight to hell\ and \ha- zel motes\ cannot be compared to \Stairway to Heaven\ or even to the music of Meatloaf. The hard rock sound leaves little to desire. They simply sound like head banging wanna-be's. I wouldn't expect to see a new al- bum, yet alone a Billboard Top 10 release, to be a product of Spell anytime soon. I only recommend \Mississippi'; if all of the record stores closed down and no other albums were available orifaliens captured you, brainwashed you, and told you that Spell was the best !:,'TOUp alive and you had to listen to them or else you would be killed. dEUS's release \New Case Scenario\ is more tasteful than the sound of Spell, but certait1ly not anything to run out and buy. The style can not be compared to Spell's either. Tite sound is al- temative, comparable to Nirvana, but not as well perfonned. dEUS, with improvement, will probably still be around in a few years. I don't have the place to announce that they don't have talent (even though Spell doesn't), but if you want to listen to the hard alterna- tive sound, save yotrrself the trouble and just listen to old Nir- vana CO's.

February 16, 1995, page 12 ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT Joan Crane and '\fraditional Country Blues at Coffeehouse Courtesy of Coffee/rouse publicity This Friday, February 17, Joan Crane will perform at Union College's own Coffeehouse. Her perfonnances will emphasize tra- ditional counlly blues, but she is just as fluent in country, folk, swing and contemporary material - an eclectic mi.x with a strong blues feeling. Her shows are bouncy and lively with finger- picking country blues; sensitive and mellow with the emotions of a sad song. Her shows are infor- mative with her knowledge of the history and men who made the blues. '\Fast and bright, Joan's fingers me all over those stri)lgs, pulling notes from way up high and deep down low. She· s got the voice to match; wann. strong vocals and plenty of humor. Highly enter- taining and highly recom- mended,\ remarks Barbara Har- ris. Joan is known for her unique picking style. which shows the strong influences of the Rev. Gary Davis and Doc Watson, plus blues artists of the 20's and 30's. She is one of the few women in the masic scene that has concentrated on the finger style of the great country and ragtime blues artists of the 20's and 30's. Joan Crane's accomplishments in her musical career are numer- ous. She has taught guitar at SUNY -Plattsburgh, written syn- dicated material, and played two years on the New York State Col- lege Coffeehouse Circuit. She has also played an extensive line of venues including: clubs, Folk Festivals, coffeehouses, and radio sh.ows. She's co-he>sted blues guitar workshops at the GottaGetGon and Champlain Valley Folk Festivals. She has recorded the well received \Dirt Pusher's Blues\ album and the recent ''Jam At the Glass\ cassette album, an impromptu happening. She has been selected to open concerts for such notables as Doc Watson, Mark O'Connor and David Bromberg, and she h~s shared the bill with 1l1e Butch Th- ompson Trio of Prairie Home Proctor's Site for Zulu Dance Theater in Capital District Courtesy of the Performing Arts Department As pm1 of it's US Tour, the Zulu Dance Thealer\ of South Africa has been rescheduled to perfonn in the Capital District on Thurs- day, February 16, 7 PM at Proctor's Theater in Downtown and excitement of their homeland. Exotic and unique in nature, it is a fonn of African theater seldom seen outside of Africa. And al- though their name implies an af- finity with the historic Zulu na- tion, their repertoire includes songs and dances of the Xhosa, Shagaan and Soto peoples, result- with students. Recognizing South Africa as one of the world's newest demo:.: cratic republics, representatives from local and state government will present Zulu with proclama- tions officially welcomi11g them to New York the perfonnance. 1l1is historic event is made pos- Schenectady. The company of dancers, singers and musicians has been careful to maintain the authenticity of their perfor- mance: the style and movement of each dance, for example, are identical to those being per- formed on cer- .em on ial occa- sions in South Africa; the songs, most of which are sung in the original language, are unchanged; and several of the centuries old costumes repre- sent attire wom by Zulu wan·iors over 400 years ago. $3/StudentiD $6/General Admission sible through the combined effort of Union College's Aca- demic Opportu- nity Program, Africana Stud- ies, African and Latino Alliance of Students., Asian Student Uhion, History Department, Multicultural Affairs Group, Peer Facilita- tors, Perfonning Arts Depart- ment, Science Technology En- try Program and .

To portray this message, Zulu uses ethnic fonns coupled with traditional songs and music which weave a picture of the hopes, fears, fmstrations ing in a fusion of cultural tradi- tions representing several com- munities in South Africa. During their visit to the Capi- tal District, Zulu will conduct a private master dance class with two local dance groups - the Burundi and Umoja dance troupes - and will visit Schenectady's Cities and Schools for a discussion and workshop General Ad· mission is $6; students with ID, $3.

February 16, 1995 PAGE16 Wlye Oloncorbiensis Women's Basketball Turns it Around by Lee Schachter Associate Sports Editor lt was a very good week for the Union women's basketball team, with an exciting .game against Vassar last Wednesday and a solid victory over Utica this past weekend. The Dutchwomen have clearly improved as this season has progressed. Union started last Wednesday's game against Vassar very slowly, falling behing 13-2 early. Ten minutes into the game, they had 15nly scored seven points. Union started to come back, though. After Vassar hit two free throws for a technical called on Union's bench, Union was down 21-13. The Dutchwomen came back, however, spurred on by Rachel Morgan's three-pointer and at the half, they trailed by just one point with a halftime score of 23-22. Union came out strong in the sec- ond half, quickly taking a 32-27 lead after a I 0-4 spurt to stmi the half. They held on to this five- point lead, and with just I :30 left in the game. thl.!y leu by a score of 53-48. But ·with 48 seconds kli. Union's lead dwindleddm\11 tu just a point. When Vassar got the ball ba~.:k with 30 seconds left. they held it until one Vassar player drove with 13 seconds left and bumped into Andrea Pagnozzi, who was called for the foul. Vassar hit both free throws to take a one-point lead. Union then came back down the court with a chance to win it. When their first shut missed the mmk with four seconds left, Amy Hitz got the rebound with time still left on the clock. As she started to put the ball back up, she was floored hard by a defender. The referee then ended the game with the ball lingering in the air. He ran off the court and into the lockerroom. I don't like to com~ plain about such things, but this display was blatantly disturbing to both the players and the fans. Union lost the game, 54-53. Union's top scorers were Hitz with 16 points &nd Pagnozzi with 14 points. As a whole, tl1e team played very well, and almost up· set a tough Vassar team that came in with a I 0-6 record. This past weekend, Union went up against Utica and had their \best team effort all season. All eleven players contributed,\ An- drea Pagnozzi said. Union started the game by quickly falling be- hind by a score of 18-6. Afterthe sluggish start, Union changed their defense to a full-court, man- to-man press. It paid off with many steals, and Union came back to take a five-point halftime lead. Union, then, started th~ sec- ond half by extending their lead to 15 points. Utica started to fight back, hut it was too little, too late. Union's free-throw shooting was very good down the stretch, high- lighted by Pngnozzi going 8-8 from the line in that time. Over- all. Union was about 80% from the free throw line for the game. The final score was 66-60, Union. Pagnoz2i had 20 points, Hitz had I I, and Marcie Heffernan had I 0. \It was a great overall team ef- fort. The scoring was spread out, and everyone contributed,\ Said Heffeman This Saturday, Union finishes their season with a big game against Skidmore, right here in our own Fieldhouse, at l :00 pm. So come on out and support the team! Matt Sugarman dunks during Union's 101-77/oss to RPL TIJe Dutchmen, 10-11, played tl1eir last game at Memorial Fieldltouse for tl1e season.

On Friday night the Dutchmen were dominated by the Catamounts of Vennont 8-2. The following night last place Dartmouth out-gunned Union 6- 5. Union's goaltending was weak, as coach Delventhal juggled goalies all weekend, with Gallant, Vilta, and Koenig all see- ing playing time. Union's lack- luster performance caused the team to fall into eleventh place, only one point ahead of Dartmouth. Union's perfonnanceon Friday night wasreminiscent of two and three years ago, as Vennont's of- fense toyed with the Dutchmen. Sophomore sensation Martin St. Louis reeked havoc amongst the Dutchmen blue liners, recording a hat-trick Goalie Trevor Koenig entered the game with the best goals against in the E.C.A.C., but fell way out of the lead, as he for· feited six goals before being pulled in favor of Luigi Villa. Athlete of the Week Andrea Pagnozzi -Page 15 Following the loss to the Cata- mounts, the Dutchmen were hop- ing to salvage the weekend against Dartmouth. The Dutchmen mounted an impressive comeback attempt, but came up short as Dartmouth held on for a 6-5 win. Trevor Koenig was pulled five minutes into the game, as both of Dartmouth's first two shots went in. Delventhal replaced Koenig with Mike Gallant, who hasn't seen action since Union's 4-3 loss against RPI on December 3. Gal- lant made some key saves early on, but the layoff turned out to be too much, as Dartmouth scored four goals against him. The KKorner Fan Abus·e? -Page 15 The Dutchmen did .however pro- vide the crowd with a great deal of entertainment, as theymounted a three goal comeback with only four minutes remaining in the third period. While shorthanded, Union's Cory Holbrough stole the puck from a Dartmouth defender, skated into their zone, and blew a perfectly placed wrist shot by their goaltender. The Dutchmen scored again on the same penalty, this time Chris Albert victimized the Dartmouth goalie with an- other beautiful shot. The Dutch- men continued to pressure the Big Green, leading to power play, with only two-minutes remaining in the game. With the net empty and the extra skater on tile ice, John Sicinski banged home a loose puck, pulling the Dutchmen within one goaL However, that would be all the Dntchmen could muster, as their comeback attempt fell short. With only six games remaining in the season and a tight division, Union's fate is iH their own hands. Union plays host to Princeton and Yale this weekend, two games which the Dutchmen have to win if they intend to go anywhere in the playoffs. With a 4..:9-3 con- ference record, the Dutchmen must win their final six games to equal last year's 10-9-3 record. Next Week: Bicentennial Issue

As early as last February, C oncordiensis editors brainstormed on how we would approach a 'Bicentennial issue.' Staff members had ambitious ideas for this special edition, and the editors began planning the issue almost immediately. We decided to run a two section newspaper - one section including the regular news from the week, and the second section that focuses on important events during the College's first two- hundred years. Naturally, planning the second section presented many obstacles. What information is worthy of being included? Union has a proud history. We have graduated one U.S. President and a plethora of Senators, Governors, and other high-level government officials. Prominent authors and prolific scientists have taught or learned at Union. Union College was founded as the first non-denominational college in the United States. We are the first college chartered by the Board of Regents of the State ofNew York. Union has the oldest chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in the state, the fifth oldest chapter in the nation. 150 years ago, Union became the first liberal arts college to offer a full engineering program. Electrical Engineering is celebrating its tOOth anniversary at Union. The College is celebrating 25 years of coeducation. Coming up with topics worthy of consideration was not difficult. Union's student activities have enjoyed a rich history. The College's debating society, Philomatheon, was founded two years before Union opened its doors. Many student publications were published in the early 1800s. In 1877, The Concordiensis was founded, and the student newspaper has served the College community for the past 118 years. This year, we celebrate the 75th anniversary of Wireless Radio Union College (WRUC). The student radio station is the first station in the nation, and the first station to broadcast an athletic event. Union is known as the mother of fraternities, with six national fraternities founded at the College. Kappa Alpha was first founded at Union in 1825. The oldest three fraternities were all founded at Union. Since then, greek life has played an immeasurable role in shaping the social atmosphere at the College. Many alumni feel closer to their fraternities than they feel towards Union. Union's campus is unique. It is the first architecturally designed campus in the United States. Ramee's model for Union was used for the planning of the University of Virginia's campus. The movie \The Way We Were,\ with Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand, was filmed on this beautiful campus. Athletics have always played an important role in enabling Union students to distinguish themselves outside of the classroom. The College's rich intercollegiate athletic history dates back to I 860. Through the years, Football and Hockey have been the most popular sports on campus. It is truly amazing how successful Union's athletic programs have been, given the College's small enrollment. Clearly, we have a limited space to present the rich history of this venerable college. As a student-run newspaper, we have encountered several problems. It is difficult to receive funding for a project of this magnitude. We have not limited ourselves financially. Through the efforts of several staff members, notably editor Heather Reynolds and executive editor LisaLemoi, the newspaper has raised enough money to cover a substantial paf! of the printing cost. Despite the lack of pay or credit incentives, student editors and staffmembers have demonstrated that they are willing to go to any length for a good cause. Lastly, and most importantly, this historical insert could never have happened without the assistance, support, and guidance of the archivists at Special Collections in Schaffer Library. From the time when we first began research in early December, through this past week, Betty Allen and Ellen Fladger have worked tirelessly at providing information to student researchers. They have kept late hours and opened Special Collections on the weekends to accommodate students' schedules. They have done all of this while putting together the Nott Memorial exhibit, and dealing with the influx of information requests regarding the bicentennial. We are eternally grateful. As always, any errors appearing in this issue are the sole responsibility of the newspaper and its writers. We have made the utmost effort to avoid historical . . maccuractes. From the editors of The Concordiensis, HAPPY 200th UNION! David Levine Heather Reynolds Editors jl . ,,

Pataki's proposition ofpulling state funding for edu- cational programs .like AOP/ HEOP (Academic and Higher Education Opportunity Pro- grams) which would be effective starting July 1, 1995 if passed, have concerned and angered stu~ dents. These students advocate that the support of these programs is not only essential to their edu- cational success, but also to the fulfillment of their future dreams. The programs being repealed also include others like the Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge (SEEK), the College Discovery (CD) Program and the Summer Tuition Assistance Pro- gram (STAP). These programs recruit talented high school stu- dents, mainly from underprivi- leged inner New York City areas and give them the opportunity to gain essential skills in reading, critical writing, Cl?mputer literacy, social research and study skills. The programs also encoul1lgestu.,. dents to develop strong .personal qualities through individual coun- seling and discussion of social issues. To qualify for the pro- gram, students must demonstrate merit, financial need and a drive to gain exceptional academic and extra-curricular learning experi- ences. The program mainly ben- efits African American, Asian, Russian and Hispanic students, but race and ethnicity play no role in the selection of students. \The programs are extremely successful in molding these stu- dents into competent, motivated, contributing members of society who have a finn sense of the roles they can play in the community,\ Ethel David said. \Abolishing these programs will have a dev- astating emotional impact on all the students who have struggled to achieve extraordinary heights. ''Abolishing these programs will have a devastating emotional impact on all th:e students who have struggled to achieve extraordinary heights.\ -Ethel David It is an absolutely unjust case of devaluing human spirit.\ The pro- posed cuts have caused outrage among students because the pro- grams have been termed as \in- effective\ in raising the overall standard ofNew York State edu- cation. Students at Union have demonstrated that because of the support they have received through the programs, they have been able to take advantage of prestigious job opportunities; in ... ternship and research positions and responsible leadership posi- tions in their communities. Some of the beneficiaries are Presidents of campus organiza- tions, have attained the Dean's I ist and are active in giving back to the community through programs like Feed the Hungry and AIDS Awareness. Others have con- ducted research at the Albert Einstein Medical School, worked at helping other students at the Writing Center and pursued ac- credited degrees in graduate school. There is a 53% gradua- tion rate in the program as com- pared to a 64% rate for ali stu- dents in private colleges. \I am taking four courses which is over the normal course load and I am working part time at General Electric. I have been struggling tremendously, but with the elimi- nation ofHEOP and possible cuts on TAP funds, achieving my dreams and hopes seems impos- sible,\ said Robert Hernandez, HEOP Class of '96. The widespread consequences that the budget cuts entail have moved students to raise their voices in an attempt to make Pataki reconsider his decision. They have until March 3rd to achieve their purpose. Extensive rallying efforts are being orga- nized to do .so. Students have written letters defending the pro- grams, organized legislative lob- bying telethons to gain the sup- port of their region representa- tives and have attended the Joint Budget hearing which was also attended by Attorney William Novice,HEOPCiassof'85. The students are now preparing to rally at the Albany State Capitol on February 2 7. '.'If the USA chooses to com- pete on an international scale with other nations, it must Jearn to make education and not national defense its platform. We must let Patki know that we will not de- sist in our fight so that he will be forced to see the error in his ways\ said Olvin Caba, AOP Class of'95. Blumberg; Nobel La.ureate, Will be Keynote Speaker for Founders Day by Adrian MacLean Concordiensis Staff Union Alumnus Baruch S. Blumberg, Class of 1946, and Nobel Laureate, will be awarded the Eliphalet Nott Medal, in ad- dition to delivering the keynote address at the Convocation cer• emony in Memorial Chapel Sat- urday morning. The convocation will commemorate the 200th an- niversary of the founding of Union College. Blumberg is acclaimed for his study of blood serum samples. He investigated the impact of family and ethnic backgrounds on the contraction of specific dis~ eases. He explored all parts of the world with his blood drawing equipment including: Nigeria, Singapore, Baffin Island Eski- mos, Natives ofSurnam and In- dia. His success came in 1963 when an Australian aborigine had the \Australia antigen\ in his blood serum. This helped in producing an experimental vaccine to fight the hepatitis virus. His discover- ies also led to a vaccine to fight liver cancer that is prominent in Southeast Asia and-Africa. Dr. Saul Krugman of New York University Medical Center used Blumberg's discoveries to develop the vaccination to fight the Hepatitis B virus. Due to all of the international work that Blumberg encountered a greatdeal of anthropologists in these exotic areas. He basically became a medical anthroJ?ologist ' and he taught a course on· this topic at the University of Penn- sylvania. His title there was a Fox Chase Distinguished Scientist and the Fox Chase Cancer Center of Philadelphia. \In a lot of these places I would be the only outsider there except for some anthropologist.

'; I ; ' ., \ I Camp~sNews Union Students Host Science Fair for Local Youths by Adrian MacLean ConcordiensisSta.ff Tbe second Annual Union College Science Fair was held in the Science and Engineering building on Friday, February 17, 1995. Elmer Avenue Elementary and Lincoln Elementary Schools in- vited their fifth grade classes to come and learn more about sci- ence. Junior Martha Kirouac or- ganized the science fair along with members of the faculty and the Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Math, Psychology and Geology Clubs. To make this opportunity pos- sible, the Whitney Foundation, who specifically sponsors Lin- coln Elementary, donatedtrans- ••Jt was exciting to have so many· people involved because recruiting so many Union stu- dents to be committed is ex- tremely difficult,\ Kirouac said. ••rt is so much fun for us to do showed how UV light makes them glow. One of the biggest hits was the «Make Your Own Slime Table.\ The fifth grade students mixed chemicals themselves and were \It is so much fun for us to do this, sometimes even more th.an the kids,\ senior Amy Howard . said. portation for all the students. Price Chopper also donated four dozen roses for one of the e?'peri- ments. There were I 23 children and 75 Union students participating in the science fair. Each group had two leaders from Union to walk them through different ex- periment stations. this, sometimes even more than the kids,\ senior Amy Howard said. The Psychology station of- fered a test that required the kids to look at a word that says purple and color it black. When they asked what color it was they would reply purple. Geology brought a display of rocks and able to take home their own slime. Also, the Price Chopper roses were poured in liquid ni- trogen to freeze and then thrown against a wall and shattered. These experiences were very ·genuine because the funding in the publics schools can be limit- ing. The goal of the science fair was to get children excited about Zoning War Continues by Jody Mousseau Concordiensis Staff The saga began when the city of Schenectady declared the use ofUnion's Lenox Road proper- ties as administrative buildings unfavorable, since they are lo- cated in a primarily residential area. When the battle did not seem to be progressing, Union took its last resort and Hull de- clared a lawsuit on the city .of Schenectady. On January 15, 1995, the Edi- tor of the Sunday Gazette wrote an editorial entitled .. Hull and Union are Out ofLine,\ denounc- ing President Hull's lawsuit against the city of Schenectady regarding the zoning of Union College's Lenox Road property. The article stated, \There are rea- sonable arguments on both sides ofthe land-use issue, but it is not reasonable for Union to file a law- suit.\ A response was issued on Feb- ruary 12 by Joseph Hinchey, chainnan of the Union College Board of Trustees. Hinchey's \ ... the lawsuit was a resort that the\ College did not want to take, but no progress was being made without the assistance of the courts.\ -Charles Casey, U.C. Public Relations counter-argumentto the editorial of January 15 stressed Union's continuing contribution and sup- port of the city of Schenectady. The justification Hinchey pro- vided for Union's lawsuit was declared in his letter to the edi- tor. ••rfthe city has enacted a con- stitutionally questionable zoning ordinance which damages the college, we are duty-bound to seek a remedy. We were unsuc- cessful before the City Council. As a n~sult, reluctantly, we must seek a remedy from the courts.\ This continuing \battle\ be- tween the city and the College hrul been kept to a low level of con- frontation thus far. Charles Casey, director ofpublic relations for Union College, stated that the lawsuit was a resort that the Col- lege did not want to take, but no progress was being made without -- the assistance of the courts. The College does not think that the situation is a crisis or a dispute with the residents of Schenectady. In the continuation of Union's bi- centennial celebration, the resi- dents ofSchenectadywill partici- pate in the occasion. A colloquium on town/college af- fairs has been planned as one of the many Founders Day festivi- ties. The maintenance of there- lationship between Schenectady and Union does not seem to be a problem to officials, and they do not foresee a deterioration of the relations anytime in the near fu- ture. What will happen next is to be decided solely by the courts, and the navigators are confident that things will now proceed smoothly. However, it is impos- sible to predict the outcome. - The Concordiens·is · February 24, 1995 · Page A5 science and make it realto them. ··we tried to make things that they could relate to and bring it home with them,\ Kirouac said. Many of the children had not looked through a microscope before, the starfish and sea en~ chant display opened their eyes. Most of them have never even seen the ocean, so this was an opportunity to expose them to something unfamiliar. All of the experiments and supplies were checked by a safety officer prior to the open- ing of the science fair and they were found non-toxic. There were no accidents thanks to the care and precaution that was put Into the planning. The science fair is geared to- ward fifth graders because they are at the perfect level to have fun and learn. Some of the ex- periments demand an under- standing of some fundamentals, like what electrons are. By the fifth grade students have a solid foundation on which to build. The fear with the older ages is that the infonna.tion would not be advanced enough. The reaction has been so strong that the science clubs are eager to keep up the tradition. Kirouac said that it is a lot of work to put together, but there- action of the students is such a reward. \Wow ,is this what you do in college,\ one fifth grader ex- claimed. In the future Union hopes to rotate the science fair to include all the schools in the area. The science fair has become so popu- lar that schools are requesting to be included.

The Founders Day bicentennial celebration will offer a new spec- trum of events. One of the spe- cial events featured during the occasion will be the awarding of the Eliphalet Nott Medals. They will be awarded on Saturday at the Bicentennial Convocation in Memorial Chapel at 10 am. The medals wiH be awarded to six alumni who have disp.layed perseverance and achieved suc- cess in theii-';espective fields. The list ofhonored alumni consists of B. Blum burg, class of 1946, Rob- ert Chartoff, class of 1955, A. Lee Fritschler, class of 1959, Michael J. Fuchs, class of 1967, Robert Laudise, class of 1952, and Cathleen White, class of 1972. Blum burg is a Fox Chased Dis- tinguished Scientist at the Fox · Chased Cancer Center in Phila- .. delphia, P A, and was a Nobel Prize winner in physiology and medicine. Chartoff is the head of ChartoffProductions, a film com- pany in Santa Monica, CA. Fritschler is the current president ofDickenson College in Carlisle, P A. Fuchs is the chair and CEO of HBO. Laudise is an adjunct research director for the chemi- cal division of AT&T Bell labs. White is the editor of Red Book magazine. The award was created prima- rily because no award exists at Union which specifically honors alumni.. The medals are named after Nott because, in President Hull's opinion, he is the greatest college president to have ever existed. The medals are bronze with an inscription .. Perseverantia Vinxit Omnia,\ or \Perseverance Conquers Alt.\ The awarding of the medals will add a quality of a new found tradition and honor to the festivities.

Let'riz, New Assistant Dean, Will Help With Multicultural Issues by Elizabeth De Koven Associate News Editor This March, Edgar Letriz will assume the position of Assistant Dean of Students at Union Col- lege. Letriz's position will spe- cialize in multicultural programs at the College. \I want to convey to Union College that 'multiculturalism' is all inclusive,\ said Letriz. '\Multiculturalism' is not ethnic or international, it is an ideology that should effect the entire stu• dent body, all .of its faculty and alI of its administration.\ Letriz' s goal is to talk to the studentsabout their needs, about what Union can be and about what Union is missing. \I want to organize programs that benefit everyone,\ said Letriz. 'To begin with, I would like to organize a retreat for student leaders from organizations like Panhelfenic, the IFC, international clubs and ethnic clubs, to revitalize and to find a new energy to attack multiculturalism at Union Col- lege.\ Letriz is a graduate of Union College. \I love Union, I am crazy about the school,\ said Letriz. \If Union needs me, I am there, there is no need to ask.\ As a student at Union College, Letriz viewed life from a Union perspective. He viewed life from inside the four walls of Union, with no regard to the outside world. As an administrator at the College, one ofLetriz's goals is to emphasize to the student body how different the world outside of Union is and howimportant it is to be awareofthatworld. Aside from specializing in multicultural programs at Union College, Letriz'sjohwill also in- clude assisting the Union Terms Abroad Office in preparing stu- dents to go abroad and in helping students readjust to 1 ife in Schenectady when they return. \I am young, I am 25-years· old,\ said Letriz. \I may look like any other college student, but I would like to emphasize that I am a professional and am very qua1i· fied for my new position.\ Letriz will begin his new posi- tion at Union in the middle of the academic school year because he is currently the Assistant Dean of Admission at the College of Wil- liam and Mary and did not want to leave his current employment before completing his tasks in the admissions office. \I wanted to leave William and Mary in a posi- tive light,\ said Letriz. \And I want Union to look at my fonner place of employment in a posi- tive light.\ Alumni: Subscribe to also discuss the friction between the to~n and the students of the College. Finally, he will describe the history of the students' activi- ties within the community. This will be followed by an exhibition at the First Refonned Church. The exhibition is entitled, ''Three Churches and the Found~ ing of Union College.\ The colloquium willthenmoveto the final church, St. George's Epis- copal, for a reception. The Second Colloquium will be held on the College grounds fol- lowing a welcome by Union Col~ lege President Roger H. Hull Representatives from each of the three churches will speak in this section called, \The 'Union' of Union College and the People of Sherin Takes Advantage of Union's GMI Program by Adrian MacLean Concordiensis Staff Starra Sherin has taken advan- tage of the MBA five year pro- gram at Union to help reach her goals in one of the \big six\ ac- counting firms. Sherin was a Union undergrad · beginning in her freshman year, · and she decided to get her MBA in her junior year. Her major was interdepartmental Math and En- glish. She wanted to get involved with the Graduate Management Institute in order to open up op- portunities in her job search. \I thoug..ht about what I wanted to do and I saw this as an oppor- tunity to help me get a job. I needed to be more practical,\ Sherin said. There are eighteen require- ments for an MBA degree and three come within undergraduate work. Union 'offers a general MBA, one in Accounting and one in Heath Systems Administration. To lighten the load, Sherin used the summertime to get ahead in six of her courses. This prevented a significant amount of doubling up in her course load. The Concordiensis for 19~5-1996 Send a $40 check to box 2577, with your address, and you will receive 24 informative issues of your student newspap~r. The term Union actually stands for the Union of the Three Churches, the members of which were responsible for the founding of Union College Early Schenectady.\ Laura Linder, of the Archives and His- torical Concerns Committee of the First Refonned Church, James Stewart, the Clerk ofSession for the First Presbyterian Church and Kevin Decker, the Parish Histo- rian of St. George's Episcopal Church will speak in Memorial Chapel. Following this is a presentation by Harold C. Martin, President Emeritus of Union College. His lecture, \A Tale of Two Wor- thies,\ is on Eliphalet Nott and Jonathan Pearson. It will be fol- lowed by a reception and exhibi- tion \Union: The First Two Hun- dred Years,\ in the Nott Memo- rial. The moderator of the colloquium is Jan K. Ludwig, professor ofphilosophy at Union College. Sta.rra Sherin, a GMI student, has landed a lucrative job offer in one of the major accounting firms (Rick Lederer/TC) GMI offers merit based assis- tantships, fellowships and partial tuition waivers. Sherin won a full scholarship into the GMI pro- gram. Although, this does require her to work ten hours a week. She works at the receptionist desk in the GMI office. One requirement of the pro- gram is an internship during the winter of senior year. GMI opened up a door for opportunity through their persistence with Coopers and Lybrand. The office in Albany was not interested in internships, but Sherin wanted to stay in the area because she is from Greenwich. Her advisor asked just for her application to be read over and to have an interview. She was given the internship and also received a job offer a year and a half early. \They made this position avail- able even when it wasn't suppose to be,\ Sherin said. The finn treated her as if she was a fit:st year auditor. Sherin had hands on work and she ex- plored all different areas of ac- counting. One project she had was to go to Buffalo and audit Fisher Price. After her internship perfor- mance, the personnel department offered her a job. She accepted the offer, a year and a half before graduation. In Sherin's undergraduate work she expected to do more computer work than she actually did. The MBA program advanced her skills that made a significant im- pression when she had her inter- views . \I feel this program prepares you for the real world instead of filling you up with a lot of book knowledge,\ Sherin said. Union's MBA program is highly looked upon and excellent for job placement. Coopers and Lybrand in particular takes on ten new associates each year and two of those are Union MBA account- ing graduates. Write for News x6155

We, then, resorted to military means to try and knock out the impediment to the U.N. and U.S. nation building plans.

Face Off Over the Crime Bill by Marc Foster Com:ordiensis Staff The President and Congres- sional Republicans are facing off over the crime issue. It is an is- sue foremost on the minds of Americans, and polls convince politicians that a hard-line ap- proach to qime will score big Republicans counter th~t the President's pledge was hollow, citing the fact that after five years the local governments will be re- sponsible for 100% of the neces- sary funding to maintain the com- munity policing program. The GOP's plan will allow local gov- ernments to use the federal fund- ing for anticrime measures that wrest the crime issue from the White House. Republicans have long espoused stiff penalties to address crime and considered the issue theirs as lang as Americans favored the get-tough approach. But in 1992, Bill Clinton cam- paigned as an advocate of the death penalty in some instances and, in 1994, signed into law the political points.

The GOP is trying to The Republicans can win pub- lic support of their crime bill by stressing its pragmatism; it em- powers local officials to attack crime as they see best fit.

.I I ., ' l Features The Concordiensis • February 24, 1995 • Page All The Smoking of The Pipe: A Class Day Tradition by Jody Mousseau Concordiensis Staff Class day, a tradition which has disappeared with time, was a eel· ebration of commencement in which the senior class, in cap and gown, gathered in Jackson's Gar- dens with jug and pipe. The drink- ing of the wine and the smoking of the pipe brought the class together in the final sharing of a tradition. A pipe oration and a jug oration ac· companied the occasion. The first evidence of the pipe tra- dition can be traced to the Class Day ceremony of 1863. The mystery remains as to what was smoked in this \pipe of peace.\ The Class Day program of June 27, 1876 mock- ingly described the tradition of the smokingofthe \pipe ofpeace.\ The \Grand Finale\ would be the \Smoking ofthe pipe of peace, the opium for which wiii be furnished by LING-CHING-NOOMAN. The first puff will be taken by GAME COCK from Scotia, followed in or- der by Dung Hill, Snoozer Joe, Shanghai from Perth, etc., ended up by Benedict Arnold, ofUnion Col- lege, after which the pipe will be burned on account ofthe filth accu- mulated.\ ln 1923, a change in tradition was made. The smoking ofthe pipe con- tinued, butanewpipe was used. A . wooden reproduction of the Nott Memorial, which was in the college library at the time, was declared the official pipe of the Class Day cer- emonies. The 1923 references to the smoking of the pipe, stated that tobacco was used. The credibility of opium having ever been used in the celebration is questioned. In the 1960's, the smoking of the \pipe of peace\ disappeared with the death of Class Day. Suspected reasons for the ending of the tradi- tion include the changing cultural and social views of the 1960's and the lack of significance ofthe event to spectators. In the spectrum of events, as it appeared to the students ofthe 60's, the smoking of the pipe seemed asinine. People also be- came offended by the sight of stu- dents drinking and smoking in the practicing of a tradition. Through the years since the be- ginning ofUnion College's history, many traditions have been estab- lished. Many have disappeared, and new ones have been adopted. The Nott pipe still exists. However, the importance of its significance with respect to a living tradition does not. Tl;is article was to appear in the in- sert of the newspaper, but because of lack of space it was moved to the features section of the newspaper. One of the College's Most Beloved Leaders: President Dixon Ryan Fox by Nalini Gupta Concordiensis Staff One of the most beloved lead- ers of Union College was Presi- dent Dixon Ryan Fox, 12th presi- dent of Union College. He is remembered by many as being a leader who gave Union much of its shape and color and much of its pride in tradition. Joining Union on February 21, 1934, he devoted himself to attacking the social history, A History of American Life - The Completion of Independence. He held offices in nearly forty organizations both state and national and was known as one of the most dedicated humanitarians ofhis time. Dr. Fox's accomplishments in the decade of association with Union were manifold. He inau- gurated the Mohawk Drama Fes- tival to making Union the first American college to carry out a \'We attempt to teach our students how to think, now what to think,' Dr. Fox once said, in one of his many efforts to inspire his students to . become \whole men\ with well-rounded interests and ability.\ pressing problems of the time and to developing an ardent plan for its growth. Packing twenty or thirty years of service into the space of ten, Dr. Fox became a figUre of inspiration for the en- tire college community. With his death in 1945, the college lost a great friend and guide but gained an undying drive to uphold the goals he cherished. President Fox was admired most for the extraordinary amount of energy with which he pursued a multitude of purposes in a multitude of fields. As an administrator, historian, author, dramatist and moderator, he held fifteen distinguished degrees and published a prolific collection of works, including one of the most distinctive series in American cooperative enterprise with the professional stage. He developed a system of government work study, raised the level of faculty salaries and made the College a cultural center for the commu- nity. \We attempt to teach our stu- dents how to think, not what to think\ Dr. Fox once said, in one of his many efforts to inspire his students to become \whole men\ with well-rounded interests and abilities. As Chancellor of Union University, he exte~ded personal friendship towards the students by inviting them to debate openly With hiln, taking a keen interest in their activities, and spending himself entirely on their behalf. The President was known for his many ingenious ways of moving students to think and learn even when outside the classroom. In one such instances, he had five portraits removed from the walls of the Memorial Chapel and of- fered a ten dollar reward to any student who could give him an accurate list of the names of the portraits. He was also a constant ad- visor and helper to The Concordiensis staff and was in contact with it on a weekly basis in support of its role as one of the most essential forums for communica- tion. state funeral held in Memorial Chapel. Representatives from all. walks of life paid tributes in his honor and the ceremony was opened to the public after classes were canceled fQr the day. The President's death was noted as a severe loss to all those devoted to the cause of liberal education and was felt far beyond the bounds of Union College. The legacy of achievement and per- severance President Fox left be- hind will continue to inspire the community in its quest for excel- lence. Dr. Fox's death shocked the col- lege community and leaders in edu- cation all over the world. he was stricken in abuild- ing of the General Electric Com- pany, while ar- ranging for special courses to be given at Union during the sum ... mer session and was rushed to Ellis Hospital, only to subside an hour later.

The majority of the people here in Cuemavaca wish to inform.the students at Union ofour deepest regrets: (I) We regret being down here in the consistent 85 degree weather with no rain. We emphatically miss the gentle Schenectady winters that consist of the fresh winter gusts, and the gentle snowdrifts that are so fun to walk through at'8:30 a.m. (2) We regret the fact that we only have to take 6 weeks of classes with no finals. We were reaJ:ly counting on the stress. of a 1 0 week term with a. calm week of finals. (3) We regret the fact that we can't hang out at the sludge ridden, sweaty fraternity patties drinking free Meister B(;:au, We are forced to buy $4 cases of Corona, $4 bottles ofBacardi, and drink around a poe! all day. (4) We regret the fact that we get our own condo complex in Acapulco -equipped with pool and servant. We would much rather be in our cozy little apartment on Huron Street with a landlord like Andy Wisoff. (5) The girls regret the fact that they don't have to pay for aoy social activities. They reaJ:ly miss the $5.00 to $4.75 pitcher deal at Gepetto' s Happy Hour. What a bargain! (6) We regretthefactthatJeremy Lieboff and crew took the life of an innocent baby guppy fish. Take it from us anglers, that was no beeper! That might have b.een bait, but certainly not a beeper. P.S. Tell Jeremy Lieboff and crew that we probably still have some steaks left off ou.r fish if they want some. Sincerely Sunny & Warm, God vs. the Gripping Television Saga Baywatch by Rawson Thurber Concordiensis Staff I was watching the griQping saga know as Baywatch the other day (and don't pretend you don't watch it), when for some inex- plicable reason, I began to think about God. Maybe it was Pamela Anderson's. skimpy red bathing suit that brought forth notions of the divine, but then again it could've been the chili I ate ear- lier that day ah, but I digress ... I've never been a religious in- dividual, far from it. In fact, I consider myself an atheist with an agnostic streak in me. But the idea that billions upon billions of people (including some I con- sider to be highly intelligent) be- lieve in the existence of a higher being, a God, makes me consider me cynical view ofthe divine. So is there a God? And if so, does he enjoy Baywatch? And if he does, who's his favorite charac- ter? The thing about God is, that I've never really seen him, and I've never actually witnessed anything that could be construed as a miracle. So I hesitate to be- lieve in something that at first glance offers little evidence that it exists at all. And then to top it all off, I've ... seen these Televangelists on TV that quote scripture to the nodding masses as they mop their sweaty brow with a handkerchief. I witness these people putting their faith (and more over their money) into a religion that has offered them little salvation in recent history. So maybe my real problem is with the church and it's leader (and idiot followers) that I take real issue with. It seems to me that the church stands in the way of the individual from gaining a closeness to God (if this is at all possible). The church is the used- car salesman of the soul. It re- minds me of something that Nietzsche wrote, \When on Sunday morning we hear the bells ringing we ask our- selves: it is possible! this is go- ing on because of a Jew cruci- fied 2,000 years ago who said he was the son of God. The proof of such an assertion is lacking ... Can one believe that things of this sort are still believed in?\ Then again this quote reminds me of a shirt that I recently saw which read: \God is dead\- Nietzs.che, \Nietzsche is dead\- God. This was humorous, but didn't answer my question. God seems to me to be an outdated term. An exhausted form of worship. Why not worship Baywatch? Granted the writing could be bett~r, but why is \God\ a more valuable icon than the tremendous curves and ample bosom of Pamela Anderson, or the stunning per~ fection that is David Charvet? Why do we as a people still p1ace our faith in a book that could serve better as a prop holding up a tired leg of a table? how can we pray to a God that allows the Holocaust, Somalia, crack ba- bies, gang warfare, and the New Kids On The Block? As w~ ap- proach the millennium (and pos- sible \Final Judgment\) why do we pray at all? I think it that prayer is an artificial form of hope, and nothing more. It is not my opinion, however, that man should place his faith wholly in science either. There are just as many faults in the numbers and calculation that it places in front of you, to war- rant you faith. Placing your hope into Physics, Geology, As- tronomy, Biology, etc. is just as foolish as placing it in Religion. There are just too many myster- ies that cannot be explained through either. And ultimately thatmightproveto tip the scales in the direction of the big guy upstairs~ but I doubt it. So what is the point of all this? Maybe there is none. Maybe I'm going straigh~ to Hell for writ- ing these thoughts down. But then again maybe not. I guess what I'm trying to say is that only the foolish put their faith in that which they cannot prove to their own heart. So if the idea of a God in the Biblical sense harmonizes with the beating of your soul, fine. Or if the idea that cal9ulations and experi- ments carve the path to the true meaning of existence, so be it. Don't follow just because it's easy. Don't not think about it,.because J:ife isjustas much death, and to ignore it is just as bad as believ- ing in a hollow promise (probably worse). I personally haven't fig- ured it out yet, but I'm happy to wade through the quagmire dur- ing the commercial breaks that interrupt Baywatch. So as you sit there reading this, don't forget to think iibout it afterward, and ques- tion what you truly believe, and what you only accept out of apa- thy.

It is, if you like, the reason for the infinite move- ment by which the reflection re- fers to the reflecting and this again to the reflection; by definition it is an ideal, a limit,\ proclaimed JP Sartre. ·look for yours on earth.\ There are two common misperceptions of the 'self and its function in life. One is that a person's true sense of individual- ity emanates from this inner natu- ral core of'self ,and that the 'self is in combination inherent and derived from the constant and complete mental processing of information gathered from the senses. The other is that the 'self is an experiential construction predicated on the failure to fully unshroud falsity and deceit, built up from the outside like Pink Floyd's Wall, that controls sensu- ality and prevents people from seeing things as they are; a limit- ing, negative force that perverts pure vision. The first view advocates the embracing ofthe awesome 'self as instinctual and therefore true. Emerson mentioned in a letter to a friend that he believed in the acceptance and nourishment of 'what he was', \but if I am the Devil' s child, I will live then from the Devil.,; This attitude of 'be- · tieving in yourself that is fostered in an individualist society is as comforting as believing that one day, \Great Gods will come from Living in accordance to what we conceive as a divine 'self', with the insistence of singularity even in matrimony, is as ridicu- lous as .. b,elieving that the passive mind can interpret everything that the senses experience at once. This is the s.ame irony wherein we credit our victories on ability, but blame our losses on events out- side our control. Psychologists will report that the mind does not, in fact, register and process all information it takes in. People understand, remember, and react, to situations selectively and dis- criminational~ as Blake printed in 1793, \The Eye sees more than the Heart knows.\ In 1972 Daryl Bern defined self-perception theory in the following way, \In- dividuals come to \know\ their own intern states partially by in- ferring them from observations of their own overt behavior and/or the circumstances in which this behavior occurs.\ Since them ind is unable to sort and consider ev- ery bit of information it takes in, every second of the day, there exists no possibility of an entirely true 'self. The second misperception of the 'self is that it is a cage of par- tially reasoned half-truths that controls our lives and must be annihilated. The constant and unrelenting destruction of this constructed state of 'self would allow for what they call in reha- bilitation slang \moments of clar- ity.\ The ultimate goal would be an eternity of clarity that stretched beyond the physicality.ofmortal existence. Considering though that the '·self is a created state of external stimuli mixed with inter- nal memories and predisposi- tions, could the 'self ever be shed? Is it humanly possible to undo all the construction that have formed around, and within us? People may be able to rec- ognize and disconnect their be- havior from certain parts of their 'selves', but the 'self' is, regard- less of how we perceive it, an in- tegral part of living. 'Selfless- ness' may exist in doses, but a shell of 'self is what an 'indi- vidual' alive (in the physical sense). Memories can be altered, many seem to fade away, but they will always remain in the work they did to form the 'self. The 'self, in this case, is not true to crystal reality, and it can and should be suspended, regardless of the fu- tility of realizing permanent 'self- lessness'. See John Coltrane's free exposition, Selflessness, 15:09. The battle against incagement towards the goal sus- tainable eternity may be unwinnable, but the fight seems a good one. A relinquishment of the part in hopes of becoming part of some- thing bigger? \Just be true to yourself,\ the well intending par- 'ent said, \and you will be happy always.\ \Why is everyone al- ways trying to change me and who I am,\ questioned the frus- trated friend. \The self on prin- ciple can not inhabit conscious- ness. It is, if you like, the reason for the infinite movement by which the reflection refers to the reflecting and this again to the reflection; by definition it is an ideal, a limit,\ proclaimed JP Sartre. ]

OPIED EDITORIAL The Disadvantaged are Not Equally Represented: Protest Education c·uts The federal government of the United States has a well-established system of checks and balances, which involves a bicameral legislature, an executive branch, and a judicial branch. This gov-. emmental organization helps to prevent the capricious abuse of power by any given branch of the government.· The American party system and the power- ful mass media ensure that politicians respect the social, economic, and politi- cal consensus of their voting constitu- encies. Most people consider the Ameri- can system the ultimate in representative democracy. The wide distribution of wealth and power that characterize American soci- ety impliCitly makes the goal of reach- ing a fully democratic society unattain- able. When tough economic times ne- cessitate fiscal retrenchment, funding for education and critical social policies are inevitably cut. These programs are easy targets be- cause those citizens who derive the great- est benefits from them have the weak-- est lobby hi Washington. They are not well represented in any of the branches of government, and only seldom do these individuals reach positions of power in the press. We have an intri- cate system to prevent against govern- mental abuse and tyranny, yet the great- est democracy fails to protect and en- courage its poorest arid most disadvan- taged citizens. Elected officials do not provide the consistent leadership nee· essary to eradicate the vicious cycle of powerless and poverty. If politicians truly believe in promoting democracy, they must maintain programs that pro- , mote equality, and more significantly, they must strive to empower -underrepresented groups. In the meantime, students must pro- test cuts in social programs,. such as Governor Pataki's proposed education cuts.. These cuts will seriously damage prQgrams intended to provide assistance to those people who need it most. ' ~ . . . - _ - LETTERS - ·. ·.

The Editorial That ·Caused an Uproar Hull and Union are Out of Line Reprinted from the Sunday Gazette Jan 15, 1995 But Hull chose to go to court. making the absurd (even if it turns outto be a successful) claim that the college's constitutional rights have been violated. Constitutional arguments should be reserved for more serious issues more directly pertinentto what is written in the document that is the foundation of our legal system Union College President Roger Hull carried out his threat on Thursday, having the cellege file a lawsuit against the city of Schenectady. At the same time, Hull announced the withdrawal ofhis previous offers of compromise, and threatened to fight this . zoning battle in court \for a number of years.\ He should be ashamed ofhimself. The dispute is over five large houses that Union owns on Lenox Road in the GE Realty Plot. Union wants to use them for offices, but the area is zoned residential, and most of the people who live there want to keep it that way. Sensibly, the city plans to handle this with in- house couns.el, thus minimizing expenses. Still, the city's lawyers and the state court: system have better things to do than deal with Hull's arrogant lawsuit. There are reasonable arguments on both sides of the land-use issue, but it is notreasonable for Union to file a lawsuit. UnionCollege is an asset to Schenectady, and Hull has in some ways been an asset to the college. and the city. He is not, however,. entitles to ignm;e the law and elected officialsand local residents, and try to ramrod his way through by adding to the surfeit oflitigation in American society. True, the college first tried to get its way in the political arena, which it was entitled to do. But when it turned out that the entire Schenectady City Council opposed changing the zoning ordinance to al'low Union to get its way, .that should have been the end of the matter. Maybe Hull thinks being a tough guy is what's demanded of an executive these days, or that venerable and expensive colleges should not be subjected to the rule of local politicians. But this way, even if he wins, he and the college lose goodwill that is more valuable than any office space. .Union Had Little Choice But to Sue Schenectady To the Editor of The Daily Gazette: Your January 15 editorial charged that Union College is irresponsible in institutiong legal action against the city.· We see the situation quite differently. As trustees of the College, we have responsibility for protecting the College's assets in pursuit of its educational goals. If the city has enacted a constutionally questionalbe zoning ordinance which damages the College, we are duty-bound to seek a remedy. We were unsuccessful before the City Council. As a result, reluctantly, we must seek such a remedy from the courts. Union College has resided in, and contributed to, the educational and cultural life of Schenectady for 200 years. It has grown and prospered here. Our prosperity··is shared by the city and our fellow citizens. We employ 685 faculty, staff and administrators and contribute $150 million annually to the local economy. Currently, we are completing three significant construction projects which cotst $15 million and shich created many jobs for our neighbors. In addition, we will soon begin the $15 million renovation and expansion of Schaffer Library. We have been able to continue to attract high-quality students to our Schenectady campu- and the 1,000 students, in tum, make significant additional financial and voluntary contributions to the community/ Our ability to do this depends, in part, upon the facilities - buldings and grounds- which we provide and maintain. The college, for many years, has owned properties adjacent to the campus on Lenox Ro~d between UnionA venue and Nott Street. Now we have and urgent need to make use ofthese properties. In 1984, the city of Schenectady amended its zoning ordinances so that the properties in that area may no longer be converted to religious or educational uses. The Board of Trustees has been advised by counsel that similiar zoning ordinances have been invalidated by the courts in cases involving Ithaca and Cornell University and Bronxville and Sarah Lawrence College. As a result, we have authorized counsel to ask the cours to decide the validity of our local law. Joseph M. Hinchey · Stonington, Conn. i I ~- :

What I resent is the aut~or's letter is not accepting the re- sponsibility for a mistake she made. If she expects us to watch what we publish then I think perhaps she should watch the content of the material she sub- mits. I realize that everyone makes mistakes, that is not the issue; the issue is blaming your mistak~s on someone else ..

I am of- fended by the fact that the author belittles the efforts of all of those who give their time and talent to this paper. I happen to think this is a great student newspaper. The Concordiensis is not only a source of news, but a forum for student opinion and a source of informa- tion about pertinent events and meetings. I hope that in the future people will recognize the amount of work and commitment that goes into the final publication of the paper. I also hope that in the future those who make mistakes will take responsi- bility, correct th~m and move on, instead of trying to shrug the re- sponsibility onto others.

' ' ' . 1 ~age A16 • February 24, 1995 • The Concordiensis SCien~e & Technology AIDS: An Epidemic of the Present and-. the Future? by Martha Kirouac/Contributing Writer The Center for Disease Control (CDC), in Atlanta Georgia, plays a major role in the medical surveillance ofthe United State'spopulation. One of the CDC's functions is to dispense experimental medications that are used to treat rare diseases. The major pharmaceutical companies usually do not develop drugs for rare diseases; when only one or two patients need the drug a year, clinical trails to test for efficacy are not practi,. cal. When a drug may be effective but has not been exten- sively tested it is considered experimental and dispensed by the CDC, which keeps records on the incidence of rare dis- eases in the United States.

It was named acquired immune deficiency syndrome- AIDS. this man as well. Let's go through the facts again on how the HIV virus can be trans- mitted. The HIV virus is spread through the passing of infected lymphocytes which are present in the blood, and blood products and in semen. The transfer may take place through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes ex- posed to blood or semen, through blood transfusions (although most blood is now screened), and through the sharing of needles. The virus can also be transmitted from mother to child during preg- nancy, at birth or during nursing. The virus also appears in saliva, tears, and urine, but the concen- tration of the viral particles in these body fluids is too low to be readily infective (i.e. this means you can not get AIDS through casual con- tact!). AIDS prevention has also been drilled into our h~ds. Use condoms when having inter- course (both you and your part- ner should be tested for the HIV virus) or abstain from having sex. If you have to use drugs intrave- . nously, use a sterile needle. The risk of contacting the HIV virus through blood products is almost nonexistent since mass screening of the blood for antibodies against the HIV virus has begun. The human body has two basic modes of immune defenses; T ceii mediated (cellular immunity) and B-ceii mediated (humoral immu- nity). There are two types ofT cells CD4 andCD8. The CD4 cells are important in stimulating other parts of the immune system like the macrophages (that ingest for- eign material), the CDS (Killer T cells) and the B cells. The CD8 cells (Kil:ler T cells )ate responsible for lysing viral infected cells. B cells are responsible for produc- ing antibodies against various foreign particles from bacteria, fungi and some viruses. The B cells differentiate when exposed to specific foreign material to make antibodies against a particular for- eign particle (note that this pro- cess is very specific 'and that the body will not make antibodies to all foreign material). Everybody should be familiar with these be- cause you were all immunized (given a small dose of foreign par- ticle so your body's B cells can make specific antibodies against the particle, e.g. polio vaccina- tion). The HIV virus replicates in the CD4 T-cells and kills them. De- creased numbers of CD4 cells in the blood are evident in AIDS patients, and a falling ratio ofCD4 to CDS cells (helper to killer T cells) is a common indicator of progressing disease. The loss of the CD4 cells thus compromises both cell mediated and humoral immune responses. B cells: Redu~:ed: It was estimated that by mid-1993 approximately 14 million people (heterosexual, homosexual, male and female, young and old) worldwide were infected with the IIIV virus. It is estimated that every 15 seconds one person is being infected with the virus. In the United States, an approximate 1-2 million people are infected. with the virus. By the year 2000 the total number of p.eople infected with th.e HIV virus may be as high as 40 million .worldwide. AIDS is so far art effectively untreatable and eventually fatal disease. The efforts at finding a cure or a preventative v·accine . have come short of being the \cure-all.\ The most common treatment for HIV infected oeople and the only legalizeddrug)orthe treatment of AIDS is AZT, 3 'azido~3 '-deoxythymidine. AZT is a nucleotide analog of thymi- dine (which is a molecule found in DNA). This molecule however has three phosphate groups at· tached to it such that when it is added by the reverse· tran- scriptase to the viral DNA during replication it blocks further growth in the chain. This drug inhibits the synthesis of DNA by reverse transcriptase about one hundredfold then itinbibits syn- thesis of DNA by the host-cell DNA polymerase in the cell nu- clease. It was found the AZT ex- tends life, reduces opportunistic infections, and improves the im .. mune response in many patients. However, it has many unpleasant T cells: · rus because no animal shows the symptoms of AIDS after HIV in- fection. In addition since the HIV virus has the capability to mutate itself into many forms and still be deadly to the host-cell it is hard to predict which wilt be effective and how to stop mutations from occurring that render tlie vaccine ineffective. A further complica- tion is that our bodies naturally have retrovirus sequences simi- Iarto those ofthe HIV virus. If a live attenuated virus was used in the body there maybe a small chance that it could combine with our bodies own re.troviral se- quences and create a new virus- which would only make matters worse. All of these problems have lead scientists to believe that the best vaccine to work on maybe a \dead\ vaccine. - After a live attenuated virus vaccine is ruled out there are still several options open; a vaccine based off the whole killed-virus or a vaccine against a specific pro- tein within the lllV virus. Since a killed virus still has the retroviral se- quences that were A normal individual will have 800- 1 000 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter ofblood.

This leads to the secondary in- fections that actually kill many of the patients infected with the HIV virus. Two of these secondary in- fections have already been men- tioned, pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carnii and Kaposi's sarcoma. There are many other secondary infections that can occur in patients whose im- mune system is compromised such as HIV infected patients. Many of you may not know that there are actually two HIV viruses (HIV I and lllV II). Little is known about the differences between the two viruses, however, HIV II ap- pears to be less severe disease and symptoms in the patient and appears to be less prominent in the population. side-effects which has caused many patients to voluntarily with- draw from the treatment and by no means is it a \cure-all.\ In ad- dition, there appear to be some strains ofthe HIV virus that qave mutated and aFe now no longer effected by AZT (the treatment does not help the patient). This is the only drug that has been le- gally approved and while pharma- ceutical companies are working hard to find another effective drug nothing has passed the extensive tests needed yet. Now in 1995, everyone knows of AI OS to some extent. It was estimated that by mid-1993 ap- proximately 14 million people(het- erosexual, homosexual, male and female, young and old) worldwide were infected with the HIV virus. It is estimated that every 15 sec- onds one person is being infected with the virus. In the United States, an approximate 1-2 million people are infected with the virus. By the year 2000 the total number of people infected with the HIV virus may be as high as 40 million worldwide. Over2 million people world wide have already devel- oped full-blown AIDS as a result ofHIV infection- most of these people are dead (after diagnosis with full-blown AIDS the average life expectancy is less than one year). In some third world coun- tries, such as areas in Africa, it is By 1982, it was clear that a new disease entity had appeared characterized by severely impaired immune system and its related opportunistic inf~ctions and cancer. It was named acquired immune deficiency syndrome-AIDS. Few drugs are effective in treat- ing viral infections. The best means to fight a viral infection is through vaccination. This pre- vents the disease and viral infec- tions by maintaining a high level of immunity in the population. In the past, the best vaccines have been attenuated live viruses be• cause they repl.icate and provide a strong immune response, giv- ing us the closest thing possible to life long immunity. However, the scientists are simply not sure on how to attenuate the HIV vi- rus, There are no animal models in which to test an attenuated vi- Many phannaceuti- cal companies are leery of continuing or starting work on a vaccination against the HIV virus. There is a general recognition that the cur- rent public policy environment is less than favorable for significant investment by the private sector toward the development of AIDS vaccines. Commercial manufac- turers of vaccines face significant economic disincentives including liability, low profit margins com- pared with gains from therapeu- tics, and the potential price of controls. These concerns coupled with the scientific challenges of AIDS have led some manufac- tures to eliminate or scale back AIDS vaccine development pro- grams. There hav<:: been several suggestions to provide more in- centives for an AIDS vaccination. For example, increased govern- ment funding of diversified gle- bal vaccine strategies, tax incen- tives for AIDS vaccine develop- ment, guaranteed purchase of an established quantity of the li- censed AIDS vaccine to ensure a reasonable return on investment, assistance with patent protection Continued on page A17 I I, I I

I Science & Technology The Concordiensis • February 24, 1995 • Page Al7 Cancer: The Scourge of the Twentieth Century by Andy Salama Co-S&T Editor One hundred years ago, the scope of vastly impacting dis- easesmost likely included malaria, smallpox, and polio to name a few. There is little argument however to deny the vast impact of cancer on twentieth century living. Prac- tically everyone knows someone or is related to someone who has perished to this most insidious disease. There is a great likeli- hood that cancer has existed for of a cell can be divided into sev\ era:l phases of growth, protein pro- duction, and division, all leading to the duplication of the cell. Certain proteins and related cel- lular events conttol when a ce!I moves to the nexJ stage of devel- opment. In normal, non-cancer- ous, animals atthese stages of cell growth are controlled by a partially understoed, vastly complicated, system of genes. For example, mitosis or the actual physical di- vision of a cell, is controlled by a hundreds or perhaps thousands Connective Tissue of years, however in the golden age of technology and science, we have been able deal with cancer (A) Normal on some levels. The word cancer is del\ived from the astrological sign of the crab with spreading legs. Cancer spreads from tissue to tissue in the .same manner. What is c~m­ cer? The cells in our bodies are for the most part involved in a cycle of continual death and divi- sion. In developing organisms, cell multiplication exceeds cell death, and total growth of the or- ganism ensues. The growth of cells needs to be regulated, this is accomplished through the activa- tion and deactivation of genetic factors called genes. When the exquisite controls that are respon- sible for cell growth are impaired, cells begin to divide even though this growth is not required by the body. Such cells sometimes ac- quire the trait of unconti:olled growth. The \offspring\ of such cells inherit the quality ofuncon- trolled growth, and the result is a mass of growing cells, called a cancer or tumor. Cell growth involves the dupli- cation of DNA, and the division of\ daughter cells.\ The life cycle dividing cell in basal layer basal lamina differentiating cell with condensed nucleus protein called cyclin. When ge- netic damage occurs, the resultantt protein. is likely to be damaged and the controlling qual- ity of the protein product is no longer valid. How does genetic damage oc- cur? There are perhaps countless methods of damaging DNA One of the most recognizable is ultra- violet radiation, which can cause abnormalities in the molecular ar- rangement or the nucleotides which·compriseDNA. When the damaged DNA gets copied for cell multiplication, the enzymes re- sponsible for the duplication of DNA carry the mistake, or may even cut out the \incorrect\ ON A. The result is a family of cells that have a mistake. Ifthis mistake occurs on crucial part of the gene, the resultant pretein product may be so damaged that its activity could be fatally wounded. Chemi- (B) Dysplasia cals, such as those found in cigarette smoke have a similar mutagenic effect. Certain chemicals which are struc- turally flat sometimes have the ability to slip between nucle- otides, and impair the process of DNA duplication. Certain types ofhigh energy radiation also have mutagenic effects, and mutate by destroying the important chemi- cal structure of existing DNA. A very recent topic of cancer involves something called tumor suppresser genes (TSG). TSG's act to inhibit the uncontrolled growth of certain types of cells. Genes are found in our DNA in duplicate, the repeats are called alleles. Sometimes, one of two parents has a \faulty\ allele for a tumor suppresser gene, leaving the child with only one good copy. This gene can be found at a genetically sensitive area of the DNA If this good copy of the allele is deleted or damaged, can- cerous growth occurs. How do we cure cancer 0 There are many different methods of (C}Carcinoma in situ treating cancers_ Most of the methods specifically target fast growing cells, as not to damage too much nonnal tissue. Chemo- therapy sometimes aims at depriv- ing cells of essential nutrients by inhibiting their uptake. Other chemotheraputic methods, inter- calate or glom DNA which pre- vents its replication. Radiation therapy a is site directed method of causing intention mutations in cancerous cells that is so severe that duplication is completed pre- vented. Researchers have come upon many problems in the treat- ment of cancer. Our bodies are \smart\ and recognize chemotheraputic agents, and of- ten build resistance to them, mak- ing therapy ineffective. What is the future of beating cancer? Some scientists have pro- posed that monoclonal antibod- ies will lead to the down fall of . cancer. Researchers can create proteins in the laboratory that will essentially go on search and de- stroy missions for cancer cells. Another more popular theory, which is being tested now, in- volves the process of \gene therapy,\ This involves inserting genes into our genome to prevent cancer. You could theoretically re- As we close in on cancer, its cure seems to be getting more and more complicated. However it appears likely that a cure will be found sometime in our lives. As we prepare to enter the twenty- first century, other diseases such as AIDS pose even more difficult challenges to met. Union 's Contribution to Contraceptive Research by Deanne Dixon Contributing Writer Overpopulation problems and increased instances of teen preg- nancy have recently caused re- searchers to focus on discover- ing more effective methods of contraception. Union College's own Dr. George Butterstein, aRe- productive Endocrinologist and recent chair of the Biology Depart- ment has joined the masses in the search. This past year, Professor Butterstein and I have experi- mented and researched a possible new fonn of contraception. In short, we are attempting to design a contraceptive injection that incorporates the immune sys- tem to inhibit ovulation. Our tar- get is the FSH receptor. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is re- sponsible for the early develop- mentofthe ovarian follicle in the female and for the initial step of spennatid maturation in the male. By injecting a synthetic peptide corresponding to a portion of the receptor sequence into female lab rats, we can induce the rats to develop antibodies against that portion of their own FSH recep- tor. We are hoping that the anti- bodies will bind to the receptor region, and thus competitively inhibit binding of the FSH mol- ecule to its receptor. If the FSH cannot bind to its receptor, ovu- lation will not occur. This particular study began about three years ago with the collaborating efforts of Dave Sachar (senior research student) and Dr. James Dias ofWadsworth Laboratories in Albany, NY. The results ofthe e:x;periment indicated that certain areas of the FSH re- ceptor B-subunit wereparticularly promising for immunoinhibition study because they were respon- sible for high specificity binding to the FSH molecule. In a con- tinuing study, Dr. Butterstein found that the region aa265-96 was a viable target. Julia Lee, a cur- rent Union student, helped to syn- thesize the peptide for injection. Last year, Jennifer Poldmets in- jected the peptide meeting with marginal success of inhibition; the antibody titers were not high enough to inhibit binding. This year I am injecting the pep- tide equipped with a \promiscu- ous T -epitope,\ in other words, a tag that T -cells are highly at- tracted to. We hope that this will increase the number of antibod- ies produced, and thus inhibit binding more effectively. We have successfully produced a greater number of antibodies, but have yet to finish testing their ef- fective binding capacity. The development of a contra- ceptive that alters the hormone receptor itself, without introduc- ing new honnones into the body, and with few biological side-ef- fects would be highly advanta- geous. By targeting the FSH re- ceptor to inhibit ovulation , we may also avoid ethical questions about contraceptive methods that terminate pregnancy (post con- ception) since, with this method, the egg is not available for fertili- zation. Lastly, FSH action con- tributes to the formation of male gametes as well, rendering it pos- sible that contraceptive will be effective in both sexes. AIDS: The Epidemic of Our Time Continued from page A/7 and exclusion of AIDS vaccines from broad phannaceutical price control legislation. In addition, the burden ofliability for personal in- juries associated with the vaccine falls primarily on vaccine manu- factures, providing another disin- c~ntive for the development of an AIDS vaccine. In Connecticut and California, there have been some statutes limiting the liability of vaccine manufactures. However, no other legislation has been en- acted to deal with these disincen- tives. The cost of AIDS vaccine efficacy trials has been estimated to be in the range of20-60 million, depending on the sample size of the trail. All off these factors have played a major role in the ability of and willingness of scientists and manufactures to investigate various vaccine possibilities. This past fall I had the oppor- tunity to work at the Children's Inn at the National Institutes of Health in Washington D.C. There I worked with many children who were undergoing experimental protocols for treatment of AIDS. These children were very special and were full oflife despite their bleak futures. I was particularly amazed with one young boy who was born with a life threatening disease. In order to save his life, the doctors had to amputate both his anrts and his legs. However, in doing this they gave him a blood transfusion (back when mass screening did not occur) that was contaminated with the HIV virus. He is now undergoing an experimental protocol for AIDS. However, you could never tell there was something wrong with him. He gets around on a skate- board and plays pool and Nintendo with special ann attach- ments and he has many friends and dreams- which probably will not be fulfiiled. I did not tell you this story to depress you but to make you realize several things. The first is that AIDS is every- where and you can not tell who is infected. The second point is that these are people and they have feelings and dreams just like you and me. They have the right to be treated them same as everyone else. Sources: Immunology by Ian R.

Prize I ($61.80), Prize II ($23.61 ), Prize III ($14.59) Achievements Celebrated for National Engineering Week by Professor Wicks Contributing Writer \Eiiphalet Nott, Scientist and Engineer\ Energy is a source of human comfort and dependence. It started thousands of years ago when our ancestors first har- nessed the chemical binding eB- ergy of wood with fires for heat and cooking. Little changed until the eigh- teenth century when some soft coal was used and the early steam engines displaced some of the need f0r human and animal muscle power in the mines. Early in the 19th century the steam engine use was extended to factories, railroad locomotives and steam ships. Late in the last century Edison's invention of the incandescent bulb and the elec- tric utility system lighted the night and also demonstrated the con- version of mechaBical to electric power for many end uses. We now use oil, natural gas, coal, and uranium as the energy source to fuel our transportation, electricity prodyction, manufac- turing processes, and heating and cooling of buildings. Our energy dependence is dra- matized only by rare events such as electric power outages or the 1970s oil embargo and resulting long lines at the gas pumps. However, the fuel shortages and fierce battles between energy suppliers and technologies pre- dates these recent experiences, and Union College President Nott was a major competitor and win- ner as verified by an 1836 poem by Oliver Wendell Holmes. \The Hot Season\ The gas light companies were mobbed, The bakers all were shot, The penny press began to talk Oflynching Dr. Nott; And all about the warehouse steps Were angry men in droves, Crashing and splintering through the doors To smash the patent stoves. What Dr. Nott had done to de- serve such recognitioo and satiri- cal scorn was to use his' skills as a research scientist and engineer to design a stove that was capable of burning the stone or anthracite coal from Pennsylvania that could be supplied via the newly opened Delaware and Hudson canal. Where others had failed to suc- cessfully bum this coal because the ash smothered the flame, Dr. Nott used his skills to invent a rotary grate for cleaning the ash from the burning coal. Dr Nott also designed better boilers for steamboats. Robert Fulton's wood burning Cleremont had in 1807 churned from New York to Albany in 36 hours. Dr Nott designed a more efficient anthra- citecoal burning water tube boiler which was installed on his Nov- elty which traveled from New York to Albany in 1832 in the record time of nine hours. These achievements earned Dr. Nott the title of\philospher ofthe caloric\ and world wide aclaim and recognition. The famous 1862 portrait by Christian Schussele eNtitled \Men of Progress\ rec- ognized the nineteen most impor- tant scientists, engineers, and in- ventors of their time and hung in the White House. Dr Nott is placed in the front and and center position. \Thomas Edison, World's Great- est Inventor\ · \I will never give 1:1p for I may have a streak ofluck before I die\ proclaimed the 22 year old self educated and often fired Thomas Edison in 1869 after he had suf- fered another failure in his efforts get multiple signals on a single telegraph wire. In 1876 the 29 year old Edison failed again. While he was trying to digitalize speech by the obvi- ous method of using voice like a finger on a telegraph key for mak- ing and breaking a circuit, Alexander Graham Bell had the novel idea of continuous analog modulation by using voice to vi- brate a diaphragm which was at- tached to a magnet inside a coil. This time Edison responded to failure by recognizing both the benefits and limits of Bell's tele- phone system. The benefit was a better signal. The lim,itation was the range, since the speakers voice was also the electric power supply. Edison had previously discov- ered that the electric resistance of carbon was sensitive to pressure. By using carbon for a mouth piece in series with a battery for a power supply, Edison quickly managed to transmit speech over several miles. He then reasoned if you can convert speech to vibration, the vibration could also be able to stored with a needle on a wax drum and then played back as speech. This invention of the phono- graph gave the young Edison in- stant fame. Union College was first to recognize him with an hon- orary degree in 1878. With his new academic creden- tials, he joined a scientific team that traveled by train to Wyoming to observe a solar eclipse. Edison chose to ride on the locomotive cow catcher where he could bet- ter think about how to make an incandescent electric light. Edison finally succeeded after his now .famous 1000 failures. During the process he also in- vented new high vacuum technol- ogy and the screw in socket, and he also observed the flow of elec- tricity from the hot negative elec- trode~ which provided the basis for all future vacuum tube elec- tronics. His Iight bulb lead to the need fot an electric util.ity system in- cluding generators and motors, andin 1886 he moved his electric manufacturing to Schenectady, which rapidly grew into the giant General Electric Company. While historians suggest that Edison picked Schenectady on the basis oflocation, empty build· ,ings and low cost skilled labor and the honorary degree he had re- ceived from Union College eight years earlier may well have been a factor in making the unlikely small city of Schenectady the electric .capital ofthe world. \George Stibitz, Inventor of the Computer\ Electricity for lighting, factories and transportion lead to the de- velopment of the radio and broad- casting systems after World War I. Ia 1926 the 22 year old George Stibitzcame to Schenectady to do pioneering work on the use ofra- dios for remote control of electric switching. He studied Physics at Union and received a Masters Degree in 1 927, and then a doc- torate from Cornell in 1930. In1937Dr. Stibitzmadeabinary adder. This was constructed with relays, batteries and bulbs, and provided a basis for all modem computers. In 1940 he was the first to demonstrate remote datapro- cessing by wiring a computer to an electric typewriter terminal. He developed ballistic computation computers during World War II. In 1954 hedesigned the prototype for modem minicomputers. Dr. Stibitz later shifted to physi- ology and performed seminal work in applying computer sci- ence to biomedical applications, by developing mathematical mod- els of the various human body processes. \Jimmy Carter, Nuclear Engineer to President\ The development of the atom bomb during World War II lead to the search for other applications for nuclear energy. The first sub- stantial effort was nuclear power for submarines. It could have an absolute advantage on subma- rines because they could stay submerged indefinitely, rather than having to surface for oxygen as was required with any other fuel. In 1947 Schenectady General Electric was awarded the long term contract for developing nuclear power for submarines. This opened a new era of opportuni- ties for Union Colleg~. Many Union graduates have made out- standing contributions at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory and many other employees be- came Union alumni by complet- ing undergraduate or graduate studies. By 1952 the first nuclear sub- marines were being completed and ready for sea trials. Thus, naval personnel had to be trained for this new and potentially high risk techl).ology. Captain Rickover, later to be known as the father of the nuclear navy, assigned Lieutenant Jimnty Carter to Schenectady as a senior officer on the Seawolfwhere he worked with Union College to de- velop a program for teaching en- gineering mathematics, physics and reactortechnologyto the first crews. Jimmy Carter returned in 1976. His speech to an. enthusiastic crowd in the Union Chapel be,.. came a major milestone in his suc• cessful campaign to become President of the United States. \Professor Richard Shanebrook, Heart Pump Pioneer\ Union College continues to pioneer new technology, as dem- onstrated by the biomedical engi- neering research of mechanical engineering Professor J. Richard Shanebtook. In 1977 he and se- nior engineering project student Michael Clune invented a pros- thetic heart valve which is now displayed in the Baxter Heart Valve Museum in Irvine, Califor• nia. This prosthetic heart valve uses an air-foil-like configuration in the high chamber to assist in creating vortices in the blood flow pattern in the ventricular cavity. These vortices aid in cleaning the cavity and also in closing the valve dur- ing contraction of the cavity. Professor Shane brook is a spe- cialist in engineering fluid me- chanics, and continues to perform and advise research that focuses on the cleansing characteristics of vortices that can be created in the blood flow stream by implanted foils. Professor Shane brook· also mentors his students in effective presentation of their research re- sults. His student Lee Johnson won the ASME speaking contest i.n 1994 by presenting his results of using a small delta wing foil to alter the flow patterns inside coro- nary artery bypass grafts. This work is continuing with mechanical engineering senior Tricia Nelson. Her goal is to dem- onstrate the use implanted foils to create vortex motion in order to clean the graft junction and thereby prevent blood clots from forming. Similar techniques are applicable to the development of an artificial heart assist devices. Engineering student Charles Howarth is now developing. designs for vortex blood pumps to .improve heart transplant operations procedures. Write for Science - Call x6155 ' .. l .. ,,-_. '

Arts & Entertainment The Concordiensis • February 24, 1995 • Page A19 Ongoing \Figurative Issues\ Series Presents Sculptor Deborah Masters Courtesy of the Visual Arts Department The New York City based sculptor, Deborah Masters will present a slide talk on her work on Tuesday, February 28th. The lecture will take place in The Arts Building in Room 215 at ll :30 AM. The lecture is part ofthe ongoing \Figura- tive Issues\ series presented by the Department of Visual Arts. The talk is free and all students and memeber of the public are welcome and encouraged to at- tend. Deborah Masters is best known for her powerful monumental figures. The figures are often cast in plaster or cement and are over life size, grounded and implacable. She describes these figures as archetypes, existential heroines and heroes who have confronted a bitter reality and kept on in the face of it. Confident in her own complete control ofthe idiom, Masters draws freely on the history of monumental figure sculpture. She can incorporate sources from the Roman, Egyptian, and Mayan civiliza- tions as well as Rodin, Bourdelle, and St. Gaudens; yet her work has a contempo- rary psychological edge. Her heavy, planar figures convey a profound concern for the traditional sculp- ture issues ofphysical presence: weight, mass, and volume. At the same time they are invested with an introspective depth that separates them from the merely for- mal. After graduating from Bryn Mawr College with a degree in studio art and art history, Masters attended the New York Studio School. She then lived and worked in Rome for two years, and then etumed to New York and established a studio in Brooklyn. Deborah Masters has had four one-person exhibitions at the Led is Flam Gal- lery, as well as solo shows at Gracie Mansion and Galerie Hirondelle. All of these exhibits have been in New York City. Her work has been included in many group shows, including Urban Figures at the Whitney Museum of American Art at Phillip Morris; In a Dark Vein at.the Sculpture Center, NYC; Sculptors Draw the Nude at the Luisa Ross Gallery, NYC; Snug Harbor Sculpture Festival, NYC; and Op- pression I Expression at the Contemporary Arts Center in New Orleans.

Sports The Concordiensis • February 24, 1995 • page A25 Skaters Will Need to Sweep Brown/Harvard 1 Weekend to Make Run at the Playoffs : j I I- I \ ; ' ' . I ! Things are looking down for the Dutchmen; with only four games remainin~ in the season Union is two points out of the playoffs. This past weekend the Dutchmen played host to the Ti- gers of Princeton and the Bull- dogs of Yale. Union desperately needed wins in both games but came up short, beating Princeton, but falling to Yale S-2. These developments mean that Union will have to tune up their play a notch this weekend against Brown and Harvard, and finish strong at Colgate and Cornell. At this point, Union is just hoping to get their feet in the playoff door, and will have to improve to get there. The Dutchmen started off the weekend well on Friday with their 7-4 lambasting of Princeton. The star was Chris Albert, who notched three goals. This effort gave him a \hat trick\ of a dif- ferent sort, as this was his third trifecta of the season. It was Jamie Antoine, however, that opened the scoring at the13:35 mark of the first period. Just two minutes later, Albert scored the first ofhis goals, to make it 2-0. The two teams erupted .in the sec- ond period, with the teams trad- ing two goals apiece, before Chris Ford scored the third Union goal of the period. With the score at 5-2, Union came out after the sec- ond intermission looking to skate out the third. To their dismay, however, the Tigers pounced all over Union, scoring two goals to close the gap to 5-4. This score Reid Simonton brings the puck up the ice during Union's 5-2 loss to the Yale Bulldogs last weekend. (photo by Rick Lederer/l'C) remained for 8 minutes, until Albert came up with perhaps his biggest goal of the night, at 18:20. This strike proved to be enough for the victory, and Jay Prentice added an empty-netter to close the scoring at 7-4. Special kudos have to go out to the Union penalty-killers, who allowed Princeton to score only 1 power goal in their 8 opportunities. Union did not enjoy the same luck on Saturday night, as they fell to Yale, 5-2. This loss looms large for Union, as Yale is now directly ahead of Union in the ECAC standings. They were tied going into the game, and the loss Continued on page A26 Women's Swimmers Look Towards Nationals Continued from page A27 The Dutchmen thought perhaps they had a good chance in plac- ing high, but Quick swam back to back events and won the 1 00. Union still swam very well, with Jackie Crane placing 5th. The top 5 swimmers all swam the event with times of 54 seconds. The 200 Breastroke was won by Megan McCarthy with a time that,qualified her for A cuts for Nationals. This time also broke the Championship and pool records by a full second. Mel- issa Pomerleau placed 4th and Jenn Terrell placed 15th. Annie Rozwadowski and Sarah Spaulding placed 1Oth and 13th in the 50 Back. This event was also a great deal faster than last year's. Times that would have placed swimmers in the top eight just barley made the consolation finals. The 200 Fly brought Union a large number of points. Jackie Crane, Flo Chretien, Kelly Jamieson, and Mo O'Donnell dominated this event by claiming 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 8th. The fol- lowing event continued Union's power. Jenn Allaire, Megan McCarthy, Sarah Spaulding, and Melissa Pomerleau earned points for their team by taking 1st, 2nd, 11th, and 12th. With Union ex- cited from the victories in this event, the divers finished the last three dives of the meet in the 3 meter event. Nicole Rubin fin- ished with a strong 4th place fin- ish. Again, Amy Lamphere and Heather Kanser dove well and finished 9th and 15th. Going into the final event of the meet, Union knew they had to win both 400 Free relays to win the champion- ship. The 'B' relay swam first, a close race all the wa~ through. Hamilton pulled through at the end to win the relay. The ten- sion grew as the 'A' relays stood behind the blocks for the final race. At this point, Union knew that Hamilton would have to dis- quality in order for the victory to be their own. Hamilton contin- ued the strong swimming they had demonstrated the entire three days. They saved their best swimmers for last and pulled a strong race that qualified them for the B cuts for Nationals. Union, also, swam very well, per- haps putting them in the position to be going to Nationals. Due to the large. size ofUnioh 's team this year; Coach Bassett was forced to swim five swimmers and one diver unofficially. This entitled these six individuals to participate in five individual events, but they were unable to qualify to swim at night. These five swimmers showed their team, and the rest of the schools attending the meet, strong and powerful swims. One such ath- lete was freshman diver Dawn Landry. Dawn began diving for Union this season having never competed in a diving meet ever before. She excelled throughout the season and finished with an impressive State meet. Next year, Dawn will surely be a competi- tive factor at this meet. Another swimmer who swam brilliantly was Jenn Borey. She dropped several seconds in the I 00 Fly, the 1 00 Free, and the 100 IM. Fresh- man Colleen Reilly swam a tough combination of events: the 200 Free, 500 Free, the 200 IM, the 1 00 and 200 Breastroke, and the grueling race of the 1650. She, too, swam faster swims than her in-season races. Another fresh- man, Karen Watts, wildly took on the 50, 200, and 500 Free, and the 50 Fly. Lindsey Johnston, also, swam these events, but in addition to these, swam the 50 Free. She dropped several sec- onds and is confident for next year's season to oe a success. Senior Erica Saltz finished her collegiate swimming career with a career best time in the 400 IM. She, too, swam a difficult combi- nation of events, but was success- ful in all of them. Although Hamilton went home with the championship, there are many aspects of Union's meet that cannot be overlooked. They placed 2nd out of 17 teams. The final score was 1077.5 to Union's 1 045. This difference in score is simply one first place finish. There were great performances by many swimmers, including the eight above mentioned swimmers that have qualified for positions at Nationals. Coach Bassett ex- plained, \Hamilton was a much stronger team than Ithaca was last year. Some things didn't go our way. Hamilton swimmers were excellent performers all three days. I think it is impor- tant to stress our high finish amongst the large number of ·. competing teams.\ The fresh- man excelled in the meet. Kelly Jamieson, Kelly Monahan, and Sarah Spaulding all shined along with the other freshman. Amongst others, Jenn Allaire and Jen Terrell stood out as stars of the meet. Jenn Allaire was very successful, beating the second place swimmer, Megan McCarthy, by a large margin. Winning the IM events for the . third year in a row is great feat. Jenn is a strong and a competi- tive athlete who shines at big championships such as this one. Jen Terrell is another athlete whose accomplishments of this year are admirable to all her teammates. After a serious back injury in the beginning of this summer, Jen got back into the pool later than the rest of the team. She worked hard, and this obviously paid off as she demon- strated this past weekend. Not only is Jen an outstanding com- petitor, she led the team in her position as captain. Her leader- ship qualities, as well as her de- termination in the pool, have earned her a great deal of admi- ration from her fellow teammates as well as her coaches. The team is pleased with their finish at the State Champion- ships. As years pass, the races get faster and the athletes more competitive. Union has a very strong team and will only con- tinue to improve.

Sports Women's Basketball Ends on a High Note by Lee Schachter Associate Sports Editor The Union Dutchwomen fir.~­ ished their season this past Sat- urday with a solid victory over Skidmore right here at our own Fieldhouse. They showed tre- mendous improvement down the stretch this season. Of their first 19 games, they only won three, while lately they've won three of their last five. It was a great ca- reer finale for the four seniors, and a great fin·ish to the season for the whole team. After losing a close game to Oneonta last week, Union came back looking strong and deter- mined against Skidmore. Before the game, the seniors were intro- duced with theirparents to honor their four years of dedication to the team. The biggest audience of the season was on hand to watch, as were Sean Gill and Craig Losben, who did the game's play-by-play and com- mentary on WRUC. However, senior Marcie Heffernan, in the l'ast game ~f her ca!7eer, missed the only game of her career due to an injury- she tore some muscle and ligaments in her ann in the Oneontagarne. Always the optimist, she said, \In the last game of my career, 1 didn't miss a singl.e shot.\ Union's other three seniors- Andrea Pagnozzi, Peh Montano, and Melissa M~guire- played beautifully, and they scored Union's first.three baskets. The first ten minutes of the first half was tight and low- scoring. Neither team led by more than four points, and the lead went back and forth. With just a few minutes left in the first half, the score was tied 27~27. But then Union went on a streak in which they scored ll straight points to take a halftime lead of 38-27. Union's run did not end there, though. They be~an the second half asthey had ended the. first, scoring the first nine points ofthehalf. This completed their 20-point spurt, and Union never trailed again. They held off Skidmore's comeback effort and won by a final score of 71 ~63. Thereweremanynotables dur- iJ1g this last ga:me of the season. Pagnozzi scored21 points to end her career with 13 12 points, sec- ond on the all-time J,ist, after be- ing just the second player rn Dutchwomen history to score 1000 points. Pagnozzi is a Dis- trict l Academic All-American, second team, and a two-tim.e :MVP~ AmyHitzhadl4rebounds in this game to bring her season total up to 273, a .new single-sea- son record! She also scored 20 points in this game. Deb Montano, a four-year letter win .. net and co-captain of the team, scored eight points and played a strong game. Melissa Maguire scored six points. She and Heffernan, both three-year letter winners, were the leading three- point shooters ()n the team this season. TonyaCapparello scored eight points; Sara Gower scored five, and Amy Dougherty, the team's leading shot~hlocker this season,. scored three. It was clearly a strong teameffort. So congratulations to the Dutch women on .a great ending to the season, and good luck in future seasons to come. To the seniors- congratulations on four fine years. The team wiH miss you! Track Prepares for States at Brown Filosi Competes in Heptatbalo.n by Mike Leding Concordiensis Staff This past weekend the weight team and jumpers traveled to Brown University to get geared up for the upcoming State Meet this weekend at Brockport. These men left with the intention to ameliorate some of their marks and hoped to qualify for Nation- als before States, but all they ended up doing was performing well against some better compe- tition and hopefully worked out all the kinks in their prepatation for Nationals. The men that made the road trip were Rich Pulver, Matt Johnson, Chuck Clerici, Matt Stern, Marcelo Tellez, and Jon Gainor. Competing in the Shot Put was Rich Pulver and, as usual, he placed first with a throwof51 feet 9 inches. Rich was chagrined that the competition was not up to his level; hopefully at States the men wit! be more up to his standard. It really does not mat- ter, however, as he will annihi- latethem anyway. In the Javelin, Chuck Clerici ended a two week streak of placing exactly behind Matt Johnson. This time Chuck placed sixth with Matt ending up seventh. In the Hammer, Jon Gainor got himself ready to place high. in the pack at States. The two jumpers, Marcelo Tellez-and Matt Stem, both placed well in their individual events. Marcelo placed folfrth. in the High Jump soaring to a heighth of 6 feet 6 inches. In the Triple Jump, Stern placed fifth with a leap of 43 feet 3 inches. The rest of the team has been at work on the Track getting ready for States. The runners took the weekend off to rest up and get themselves in optimal condition for the upcoming meet which is to be held this Friday and Saturday. The team will be leaving at 6:00 a.m. on Friday morning so we wish them well as they head offtoStates. States fm: NadineFilosistarted last Sunday and :Monday in the Heptathalon. Nadine competed in these seven events: 1 OQ meter hurdles, shot put, 200 meters, long jump, high jump, 800 meters, and the javelin. Nadine did a great job starting off the women's scoring by grabbing fourth in the whole state of New York. Wonder woman Nadine Filosi did it again by performing this wef'l in the Heptathalon. Now Nadine will join the rest of the women and men as theytravel to states this weekend. Hockey Loses to Yale, Falls to 11th in Conference Continued from page A25 to Yale puts Union in a tough situation. Neither team scored in the first\ period, as Yale failed to score on either of it's power plays, Union could not connect on it's own. The game continued score- less for much of the second pe- riod, also, until Yale tallied it's first goal with only 44 seconds to go. Although this was a demor- alizing blow to Union, they came right back in the third, as Chad Thompson tied the game just tWo minutes into the period. The teams battled evenly for the next 7 minutes, until Yale pulled ahead again at 9:20. This only silenced Union temporarily,· as Reid Simonton evened the game at 2-2 with an interesting back- hand flip move. Yale, however, was not to be denied. Yale defensemen, Curtis Millen; scored the game-winner at 16:48. Andy Weidenbach added two empty-netters, to end the scoring at 5-2. This split weekend, as previ- ously stated, puts Union in the unenviable position ofhaving to come back from eleventh place in the ECAC to grab a playoff spot in the last weekendofthe year. Although this is ·not impossible; the team will have .to improve their play ifthey are going to re- peat last-year's playoff appear- ance. ~~~~~'ffi}f~~~~~~~~·~ ~.

(photos by Laurel Ruma!The Concordiensis) Women May Send Eight Swimmers to Nationals After 2nd Place Finish by Julie Ivanyi Concordiensis Staff This past weekend at the Alumni Gym, the New York Women's State Swim Meet took place. Seventeen teams came to Union to swim in a three day meet that was filled with excite- perfect. Especially with the way Hamilton has been performing, we had to be <>ur best. It, also, requires a little bit of luck!\ A lot of positive things hap- pened at this meet, including a new school rec:ord, and 8 swim- mers possibly qualifying for Na- tionals: J enn Allaire, Eri After losing to Hamilton in a dual meet during the season, U11ion knew they had more competitiom than last year .. ment and competitive swimming. Four teams were the obvious strong contenders for the cham- pionship: Hamilton, Hartwick, Ithaca, and Union. Last year at this meet, which took place at RPI, Union dominated the meet. This brought them a strong vic- tory. It also put an end to Ithaca's three year winning streak. Union came back this year with a strong team filled with talent and depth. These are the factors that are needed to win such a champion- ship. After loosing to Hamilton in a dual meet during the season, Union knew they had more com- petition than last year. They knew they were going to have to perform their best. Both Hamilton and Union are similar teams, although Union is stron- ger in the specialty events, such as the IM and stoke events. Hamilton dominated the freestlye events. If the two teams were to combine and take the best ofboth, an unstoppable team would be created. Both teams were hun- gry for the victory to be their own, which escalated the intensity and challenge of the meet. As coach Susan Bassett explained, \To win a championship such asthis one, it requires for everything to be Hayashi, Jonatha Meade, Jackie Crane, Mo 0 ~Donnell, Megan McCarthy, Melissa Pomerleau, and Sarah Spaulding. Overall, it was a great team performance. This year's meet was a lot faster than last year's meet. Times that would have placed in the top 16 at last year's State meet didn't make the nigllt session this year. One reason for this may he that other teams were a lotfasterThan they had been in the past. Schools such as LeMoyne, St. Lawrence~ and William Smith have greatly improved placing several times in scoring positions. In some events they beat Union swimmers, possibly causing the final score to be as it was. Union perfonned very well, but as captain Annie Rozwadowski commented, ~'Union swam well, but Hamilton swam great!\ Union was able to maintain a close edge on Hamilton by their depth. If they didn't place first or second, they may have placed two or even three in the top 8. This is how Union was ahead of Hamilton at the end of the first night of finals by a score of 395- 371. The first event of the night was the 200 Medley Relay. Union's 'B' relay finished first in the Bonus finals. The relay of Julie Ivanyi, Jenn Terrell, Kelly Jamieson, and Kelly Monahan outswam Hamilton's relay by over two seconds. In the 500, Union's Jackie Crane and CeCe Buchanan placed 5th and 8th. In the 100 Fly, Mo O'Donnell, Jackie Crane, and Megan McCarthy placed 4th, 5th, and 8th. Although Hamilton won this event, by placing 3 swimmers in the top 8, Union was able to maintain a close score with Hamilton. Kelly Jamieson and Flo Chretien qualified to swim in the Consolation finals. Kelly's time would have placed her 6th, but the places are locked in. This means that 8th place can not fin- ish any worse. Ninth place can- not place higher than 9th or worse than 16th. This happened in the following event, the 200 Backstroke, as well. Sarah Spaulding and Jenn Allaire placed 2nd and 3rd with times that qualified them both forB cuts for Nationals. Annie Rozwadowski was seeded 12th going into the night session. She finished 9th, although her time would have given her a place of 6th. Jenn Davidson and Kelly Monahan placed 14th and 15th in this event. Along with other specialty events, such as this one, Union really dominated. The next event, the 50 Breastroke, was also captured by Union. Melissa Pomerleau and Jenn Terrell won and placed2nd, both times just tenths away from the school record. Jenn Allaire and Megan McCarthy followed their teammates example and placed 1st and 2nd in the 200 IM. Jenn' s time qualified her for the B cuts for Nationals. Flo Chretien, CeCe Buchanan, Mo O'Donnell, and Alyson McKee eamedpoiAts for Union by finishing 9th, 11th, 13th, and 15th. Once again diving brought the team more points. Nicole Rubin took third in the 1 meter compe- , tition. Amy Lamphere and Heather Kanser took lOth and 13th. In the last event of the evening, the 800 Free Relay, Union's team of Jenn Allaire, Kelly Jamieson, CeCe Buchanan, and Jackie Crane placed third. Even though Hamilton was able to win this relay, they were still behind in the final score of the night. Friday night began another ses- sion offastswimming. The first event of the evening, the 200 Freestyle relay, was won by Hamilton. This exemplified their strong freestyle talent on the team. Unfortunately, Union's 'B' relay disqualified in the morning and was therefore unable to swim in the evening. But Union bounced back in the following event when Jenn Allaire beat a Hamilton swimmer by 3 tenths of a second in the 400 IM. Along Breastrokers, Megan McCarthy, Melissa Pomerleau and Jenn Terrell, Union was able to domi- nate the 100 Breastroke by cap- turing 1st, 2nd and 7th. The 200 Freestlye was another event that was much faster than in past years. Jackie Crane, Kelly Jamieson, and CeCe Buchanan all placed in the top 16. Friday night ended well for Union as they won both the' A' and 'B' 400 Medley relays. Sarah Spaulding, Melissa Pomerleau, Mo O'Donnell, and Eri Hayashi beat second place finishers, Ithaca, by a full two seconds. The 'B' relay of Annie Rozwadowski, Jenn Terrell, Megan McCarthy, and Kelly Monahan beat Hamilton's 'B' relay by 3 seconds. By the end of the night, Union was be- hind Hamilton by only a point and a half. Coming into the meet Saturday Coming into the meet Saturday night, Union knew they had to be performing at their best to be victorious. with the two other IM events, this is the third year in a row that Jenn has captured victory. CeCe Buchanan had a great swim and placed 4th. Flo Chretien cap- tured 7th place, and Alyson McKee finished 13th with two very strong swims. The 50 Free was another event that exempli- fied the quickness of the meet Jonatha Meade placed 7th, and Eri Hayashi took 11th. As on Thursday, the stroke events dem- onstrated Union's talent and strength. In the l 00 Backstroke, Jenn Allaire, Sarah Spaulding, and Annie Rozwadowski took 2nd, 5th, and 7th. In the SO Fly, Mo O'Donnell and Kelly Jamieson took 5th and 6th. With night, Union knew they had to be performing at their best to be vic- torious. With Alyson McKee and Flo Chretien capturing 1Oth and 15th in the 1650 in the morning, Union carne into the night with CeCe Buchanan placing 8th in this event. This was an outstand- ing swim for McKee, in that it was only the second time she has ever swam this event. She dropped a minute and a half from the first time she swam this event in the fall. Union was confident with the following event of the 100 Free. The 2nd place finisher of the 1650, Kate Quick from Hamilton, also swam this event. Continued on page A25 - ....

Page 82 ·February 24, 1995 ·The Concordiensis Campus Life The Idol: Treasured Chinese Statue has Found a Warm Home at Union by Adrian MacLean Concordiensis Staff Four clever vandals began one of the most treasured traditions at Union, painting the Idol. To fully appreciate the value of the idol, the history should. be told. In 1860, when the Idol was discovered, it was sought to be a treasure. The lion was a symbol of\happiness good fortune and extended I if e.\ This priceless statue was a gift to Rev. Dr. J.M.W. Farnham from the officer in charge of the excavation. The Idol was found on the southern end of Shanghai in the\ building earth works for the de- fense of the city against the \Longhaired rebels.\\ Dr. Farnham was a Union alumnist from the class uf 1856 and he donated the Idol, \I thought such a piece of sculpture would be rare and val- ued at old Union. But I never dreamed it would become an \idol or help the boys out in so many ways,\ Farnham said The first painting of the Idol was in 1876, Dr Farnham had been appointed as the Chinese Commissioner to the U.S.A Cen- tennial Celebration in Philadel- phia, Pennsylvania, and it was rumored that he would be at Union for commencement. The Idol before it was covered with many coats of paint The statue was a gift from Rev. Farnham. At the time, the Idol sat in a bam under the care of Colonel Picket. Dr. Eliphalet Nott Potter, President of Union, ordered for the lion to be placed behind the President's house. Four students stole black and white paint from the nearly completed NottMemo- rial and covered the priceless relic. One student also had a wa- tercolor set and painted the mouth Tuition at Union: Then and Now by Adrian MacLean Concordiensis Staff After two hundred years the cost of attending Union has in- creased roughly three and a half times after calculating out the fluctuating dollar value. In 1795, when Union was founded, men only paid $5.68 for ten months of college. Just ten years later board alone rose to $28.50 each term and tuition for half a year was about $15.00. \To the board of his son John\ was the typical format of the bill that William Beauty received for his son John in 1805. Additional costs would then be added to the bill such as: candles for $.75, reci- tation rooms, $1.88 for private attendance and $2.68 for public attendance, wood and cutting av- eraged $12.70, use ofthe library for $.75 and printings were $.50. By he centennial year of the college, the tuition doubled from $15 for half a year to $30 each trimester By the 1940's it had increased to $57.50 and the meal plan had been implemented. It was mandatory for all students to eat five days a week in Hale House, fraternities were the ex- ception. After World War II the United States economy was on the rise, and in 1950 the inflation of tu- ition began to grow tremendously and continued up the scale. An undergraduate semester was $250, room and board was $100 and the meal plan was $64 for five days a week. Ten years later in 1960, tuition more than doubled to $575 per semester, room and board rose to $150 and meals to $210. How- ever in 1970, the cost of tuition more than tripled to $2,400, room and board doubled and then some to $480 and meals rose to $630. The biggest jump came be- tween 1980 and 1990. In the eighties, tuition at Union was $5,520 and room and board av- eraged around one thousand dol- lars. The nineties came along and tuition jumped to $14,420 and room and board averaged $2,300. This was the largest rise, but to- day students pay even more. Union's standards changed along with the years. It use to be that courses were chosen for the students for each year of college. The preparatory requirements for admission in 1835 include: Adams' Latin Grammar, Com's Nepos, Caesar's commentaries, Arithmetic, English, Grammar, Geography, Virgil, Circero's Se- lect Orations and Moore's Greek Grammar. Today's requirements for a Liberal Arts degree are: four years of English, at least two year of a foreign language, two and one half years of Mathematics.

After the prank was completed, three of the students placed an announcement on the bulletin board outside the chapel entrance. \Prexy\ was a nickname for President Potter and the saying poked fun at him and the statue. \Prexy's LittJ;e God Has Changed Its Color,\ the bulletin said. Upon this disaster, Dr. Farnham never appeared at Union. He first saw the Idol in 1883 in the fields behind the li- brary. \I was rather disgusted when I visited Union and saw it in the fields behind the college. But it has found a place in the affections of the students I never expected, having become their local deity,\ Dr Farnham said Many attempts \vcre made to remove the paint, but the idol v.as initiated into a tradition. Frequent paintings began to occur, but in 1921 it was struck by an iron weapon and part of the statue was broken off The lion was tempo- rarily restored, but never returned to original form Vandal ists carried it one step lll far again in 1940 The idol had been pushed over and a derrick was required to lift it back into position. A year later it was set on fire in hopes that the paint would be removed. Part of the tradition of the Idol .· [ that has been removed is the ri- val between the freshmen and the sophomores. In the paint wars, ~ '• the freshman were green and the sophomores were red. Whoever won the war had the honor of their i 1 color for the semester. ; ' A A song was written and signed 1 by a man called the \Red Idler.\ This was written when a proposal I was made to remove the one inch II thick coat of paint from the Idol.

I ;I ' '· Campus Life Union Traditions: by Kara Christian CfJncordiensis Staff For the past two-hundred years, Union College has been rich in spirit and tradition. Although, several traditions have come and gone, they all served to promote unity, enthusiasm, and class spirit among members of the student body. One of Union's early traditions was a ceremony called the \Burial of Logic.\ In the mid-19th cen- tury, sophomore students were required to study logic using Ri- chard Whatley's Elements of Lqgic, the most popular logictext .. ·book of its time. Whatley's text was complicated and demanded hours ofrote memorization by stu- dents. Students despised this course and the tedious work it re- quired. As a result, in 1854, stu- · dents played an elaborate prank, the ''BurialofLogic.\ The perfor.,. mance included a band, a parade, and a funeral service with dirges and a sermon. At the end of the service, the \dead\ was deposited into a barrel and was lit on fire. The culmination of the sham cer- emony was a procession leading to parties and mischief. This \Planting ofWhatley\ continued year after yearand was.apparently effective, because in l856the logic course was no longer required. La~r in the century, burial ceremo- nies were held for various math textbooks. The burial ofMath and Logic became a tradition. Many Union traditions pro- vided entertainment for the upper- classmen. Perhaps the best ex- ample of this is Freshman Caps. All freshmen were required to wear a distinctive cap, which made them known to each other and the rest ofthe College. The caps were worn to remind freshmen of their place at the College. Tradition- ally, the caps were green with gar- net buttons, but later changed to black with green buttons. Upper- classmen believed it was good for new men to be put in a humble and modest state of mind so that they might learn more quickly the practices ofthe College and con- form to Union College life. While most freshmen faithfully wore their Above: Frosh Parade during halftime of Union-Trinity game, Octo- ber 28, 1922. Inset: The Idol was knocked over during a paint .fight, September 1930. caps, a few rebelled. Such viola- tors were punished. The student council decreed that violators would betaken to the College bar- ber and given a haircut resembling that worn by the inmates of pris- ons. Several traditions encouraged class spirit. Class scraps were very popular and exemplified the nature of boys. In 1864, an orga- nized class scrap was held with chestnuts as ammunition. The event was stopped due to eye.,. sight injuries. A few years later, Cane Rush took place. Cane Rush was a free-for-all struggle be- tween two c.lasses, the sopho- mores and the freshmen. For years, class scraps were in full force\. During Cane Rush in the pasture, classes had salt and tomato fights. These fights gave sophomores a chance to plaster freshmen with overripe tomatoes while freshmen fired back with bags of salt. Another popular class scrap was ChapeJ Rush, a snowball fight in the slush. Dur- ing Chapel Rush, everyone got a good soaking and several College windows were broken. During Union's early days, the campus included pastures. A fa- vorite prank was painting the fac- ulty cows to resemble zebras. Perhaps one of Union's most popular traditions, the painting of Union's Idol started back in 1876. The Idol was a gift to Union Col- lege from an alumni who had been working in China. After years of collecting dust in the college barn, the Chinese Idol was moved onto campus due to an expected visit from its donor. Four students found the Idol hideously ugly and plotted to cover it. One night af- ter the Idol had been set up, the boys took action and covered the .Pajama Parade: T-he F-resltmen sing and rally behind Union 'sfootball team during the mid 1900s. The Concordiensis · February 24, 1995 ·Page B3 Our Culture Idol from head to toe in black and white paint. From then on, paint- ing the Idol became a custom of Union students; Paint fights around the Idol were also com- mon. Move Up Day was an annual Union tradition. The spring morn- ing began with paint fights at the Idol between the freshmen and sophomore classes. Later in the day, students gathered at Old Chapel. The seniors sang songs and marched around the Chapel. During this ceremony, juniors symbolically took the seats of se- niors. Later in the day the Idol was painted white and a huge bonfire was built. Students danced and rejoiced, especially the freshmen, who threw their ... caps into the fire celebrating their release from freshmen bondage. Among the traditions that have somehow disappeared is Class Day. Class Day was held on the Friday of commencement week- end. On this day, seniors dresse,d in cap and gown, planted ivy on oneofthe ~am pus buildings and then proceeded to Jackson's Gar- den, where they sat in a big circle. Here, in the Garden, the passing ofthe pipe,. a replica ofNott Me- morial and the sharing ofthe jug were reminders of old traditions. This custom faded in the 1960's. For years in the mid-1900's, during Union's football season, the freshmen dressed up in their pajama's and beanies and partici- pated in the traditional Pajama Parade. The parade started at Union's £ield with a bonfire and cheers and traveled up Nott Ter- race to State's Van Curler Hotel. Here, the freshmen greeted the visiting football team, sang and displayed devotion to Union . -~· The parade inevitably turned into a rowdy \cocktail party\ along State Street. Every class looked back on the Pajama Parade as the high point of their freshman year. Because of wild partying and prop- erty damage, the parade was even- tually canceled. More recently, each year Union students looked forward to Camp Union, a day of sun and fun. Camp Union was Union's spring weekend party, a day of bands on West Beach, comedians, bar- becues, and booze. Camp Union ended in 1989 because of exces- sive drinking, injuries, litter, and strangers coming onto campus. In 1979, Fi1z Hugh Ludlow Day was started by a group of friends who decided to attack falling stu- dent morale. The day, named af- ter FitzHugh Ludlow, the author ofUnion's Alma Mater, \Ode to Old Union,\ had several goals. The celebration was. dry in order to prove that people could have fun sober. The purpose ofthe day was to promote interaction be- tween students and faculty in a nonacademic environment, to pro- vide a good time for the entire Union community, and to instill a sense of pride by reflecting on Union'shistory. Someofthedays events were games, barbecues and fireworks. In 1989, the cam- pus-wide celebration ended be- cause its original goals were lost. Fitz Hugh Ludlow Day had be- come another Camp Union, a day of drinking and parties. Still today Union College has many traditions. Among the most popular are painting the Idol and Naked Nott Runs. Unien 's tradi- tions make it unique to any other college. Its tradition and history create remarkable pride and spirit.

The newspaper gained in popu- larity during its early years, but suffered from a lack of financial support. During the first ten years, the newspaper was able to bolster its financial position through the solicitation of adver- tisements and subscriptions. Printed at different presses each year and frequently hindered by lack of facilities for accurate news- gathering, The Concordiensis in its first decade made little attempt to be anything more than a semi- literary, semi-newspaper. In 1890 the format of the newspaper was enlarged and revitalized with new print and cover, and was put out as a semi-monthly. In 1892 it was printed on alternative Wednes- days, and in 1896, it was issued weekly. During the next twenty years, The Concordiensismoved from a 24 page weekly to a 4 to 8 page paper publ'ished twice a week. During its 40th anniversary in 19.17, under the editorship of Ralph Knight, the newspaper was published three times a week. It was during Knight's editorship that The Concordiensis expanded its news content, and shed its lit- erary theme. The newspaper was printed in four column format un- til 1920, when it added an extra column to each page. The move towards news format made the Concordiensis even more suc- cessful. During its infant years as a broadsheet newspaper, many memorable front pages were pro- duced, and stories such as the an- nouncement of the first wireless broadcast by Union College's own radio club made important headlines. In 1927, during The Concordi- ensis ·50th anniversary, the Ga- ::t!ltc Press became the newspaper's printer, and the two newspapers enjoyed a favorable relationship for many years. Dur- ing this 50th anniversary, the newspaper moved to a six-column format, and the college newspaper's appearance closely resembled that of its printer. Dur- ing the 1928-1929 school year, the Sports Page was formally intro- duced into the newspaper, though sports coverage was prominent in the newspaper long before then. The six column paper was rein- stated in September 1933. In February, 1942, The Concor- diensis published a special sixty- fifth anniversary issue, under the editorship of A V. Feigenbaum' 42. The College celebrated Concor- diensis Day with a banquet and a special chapel program. The Con- cordiensis Club, consisting of Senior Board members, past and present, was formed.

Page 86 · February 24, 1995 · The Concordiensis Cam pus Life Philomatheon: 202 Years of Debating by Kevin Olds Contributing Writer On October 17, 1793 a few stu- dents in the Schenectady Acad- emy met in the Academy build- mg and founded the Philomathean Society. This first extracurricular organization in what was to become Union Col- lege, two and one halfyears later, was organized as a literary soci- ety. Its founders were intensely serious and possessed studious minds. The meetings for the most part consisted ofl iterary readings and criticisms Soon afterwards extemporaneous speaking and debating was added. The original name of the Philomathcans was the Calliopean Society but when the group reorganized i.nto Union College at its founding in 1795 the new name was adopted also. The name appears on the various seals of the organization always in Latin but is represented in the most common design by the let- ters \Kappa Phi\. These stood for the Greek words, KONONIA FILOMA-qWN, which are translated most frequently as So- ciety of the Friends of Learning or simply Philomathean Society. Literary societies were very popular among the students of that day and the Philomatheans were soon copied. The most prominent among these was the Adelphic Society founded in 1797, which became a·iong stand- ing rival of Philomathean Soci- ety. The Society however was the largest, having admitted by 1820 a total of 395 members while the total registration of the college during this period was only 1003. In 1849thesociety had 115 attending members and had admitteda total of over 1400. S1,.1rprisingly enough these early literary groups had many of the features that were later to mark the social fraternity. They were mutually exclusive in character, with the exception that the presi- dent and faculty were honorary members of all, they were in- tensely secret and had a regular badge, form ofini- tiation, and most likely grips and passwords. There were severe fines for violating any of the secrecy even ex- tending to the point of keeping S(lcret the contents of the I iterary papers. This gradually lapsed after the in- troduction of the social fraternity. One of the most important functions performed by the I iterary societies was their maintain- ing of extensive li- braries for their members. In 1852 the Philomathean library had 3,368 volumes and by 1863 had well over 4,000. About 1890 or 1900 the College \acquired\ these collections from the I iterary societies still in existence. In fact, it is still possible to run across a book or two in the archives that bear a Philomathean or Adelphic The Idol, Union's Literary Magazine by Karen J. DePoto Contributing Writer On February 27, The Idol, Union College's literary maga- zine will be available to students. The 1995/do/, which features po- ems, short stories, drawings, and photographs from Union stu- dents, resembles the first issue of bum. However, this was sus~ pended a few months after its first publication, and no new attempts at a I iterary magazine were made until 1832. At this time the Parthenon first appeared, lasting on and off for the next few years. After 1850, several short-lived magazines arose, including the Scool, the Concordia, and the the maga- zine pub- lished in 1 9 2 8 .

Since 1928, The Idol has been in continuous publication, distin- guishing it as Union College's longest~running literary maga~ zine. Over its sixty-seven year history, The Idol has seen many changes at Union. Yet, The Idol still maintains the tradition which is characteristic ofUnion College. bookplate. The peak of the literary orga- nizations was reached between 1800 and the Civil War. Both the Philomatheans and the Adelphics at this time were about equally prominent and fierce battles were fought over each student consid- ered excellent in debating, writ- ing, or poetry. The decline of the literary groups had been inevitable even before the Civil War but with the resumption ·of nonnal activity af~ ter the war it became more pre- cipitous. The changing interests of students, the rise of different organizations more readily adapt~ able to student needs, and perhaps the growing size of Schenectady made student interest turn more and more from the serious char- acter of these societies to other things. The decay became appar~ ent as the membership fell, meet- ings became less frequent, and detailed records were no longer kept. Although, the fiftieth anni- versary ofthe Philomatheanshad been celebrated in 1843 with po- ems, speeches, a dinner and a gathering of alumni, the centen- nial in 1893 seems to have been almost completely ignored. By the tum of the century the character of the Philomathean Society had profoundly changed. The Society reached a point where the old literary character died out entirely. It was no longer a dominant campus activ- ity but had been trans- formed onto what was re- ally an inter- collegiate de- bating organi- zation. The Adelphics had also survived the death throws of the literary societ- ies and the two organizations continued to com- pete in the new debating age. The climactic battle came .in 1923, when the two aged societies faced off in the Allison-Foote prize de- bate. The Philomathean Society won the debate and the Adelphics soon went extinct. When the Philomatheans eel- ebrated their sesquicentennial anniversary in 1943 the society had only a few members and seems to have briefly died out later that year. It was reincarnated in the early 1950's as a purely debating Society and survived irt that form until the late 1960's. At this point the Society seems to have disappeared. Although there have been rumors that the Philomatheans went ~·under­ ground\ and exist@d into the 1970's, no fgrrnal proof of this has been discovered. In Spring term 1991 the Philomathean Society was offi~ cially re-established. Th4s time the Society was refonned in the image of the original Philomatheans. Besides debates the Society takes part in extem- poraneous speaking and often has literary presentations and guest speakers. The PhilomatheanSo- ciety has weekly meetings every Friday night at 7:29pm in the . Milano Lounge of Hale House. Here .is a quoted·part of a speech given at the fiftieth anni- versary of the Society~ 1 'The noble origin of the Society, its contin- ued prosperity an~ increasing usefulness, must make every Alumnus honor the Institution of his choice, and feel proud to be enrolled among her favored sons.

Campus Life February 24, 1995 · The Concordiensis· Page B7 A Pioneer Celebrates Its 75th Anniversary: WRUC Then and Now by Christoph 0. Ringwald Concordiensis Staff Whereas Union College is cel- ebrating this year its 200th anni- versary, Wireless Radio Union College (WRUC), the student radio station at Union College, is. celebrating its 75th anniver- sary. Tit~ Genesis The evolution ·Of radio at Union College has its origins in Charles Proteus Steinmetz, Chairman of Union's Department of Electri- cal Engineering from 1902 and 1913, and in General Electric Company experiments in wireless communications on Union's cam- pus. After conducting experi- ments for several years in a small room in the Electrical Engineer- ing Building, the Company do- nated its equipment to the Col- lege. Under the advisorship of Steinmetz' successor, Ernest J. Berg, Union students in 1913 es- tablished a \wireless laboratory\ with the inherited equipment. Although most of the opera- tions before World War I were \purely experimental in nature,\ communications had been estab- lished with Cornell University, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Michigan. In 1915, the Unio'n College Radio Club was organized. World War J,. The First Setback In 1917, operations came to an abrupt end with the outbreak of World War I. The Federal Gov- ernment suspended all amateur operations and ordered all trans- mitters be 'sealed.' The Rebirth . Despite the interruption of ac- tivities, operations were revived in the fall of 1919. Vital in their rebirth was Ellsworth D. Cook of G .E. Equally significant was the improvement in the design and production of vacuum tubes, an essential component of any transmitter. WRUCThen • • • NSI .. ~· .

INSET: Radio Station's first portable broadcast Union College \Firsts\ On the evening ofOctober 14, 1920, two Union students made radio history with a transmitter in a tiny shack in a corner of the former Electrical Engineering Building, now the College Cen- ter. The station, then known by the call letters 2ADD, broadcast approximately 30 minutes of \top 40 \music which was received not only locally, but also as far away as Hartford, C.T., 105 miles from the campus. The headline of a local news.., paper on this historic event the next morning p.roclaimed: \Union (College) again pioneer of American college world; mu- sic by wireless telephone latest ·radio feat. Operators hurl jazz 50 miles through space. Aerial concert is first in collegiate his- tory.\ Although some claim that Union's station was the first sta- tion in the nation to engage in regularly scheduled broadcasting, records show that it was \ante- dated only by WWJ in Detroit.\ That station made its first regu- larly scheduled bfoadcast on Aug. 20, 1920. That Union's station was the first station ever to broadcast an athletic contest, is undisputed. On Nov. 14, 1920, the station aired live the Union-Hobart football game. Another first, and perhaps the most sensational stunt in Union College radio history, was the · \baby carriage incident,\ which is considered the nation's first portable broadcast receiver. On May 6, 1921, several members of the Radio Club rigged a baby car- riage with a radio receiver and wheeled the carriage, With baby, through the streets of downtown Schenectady. The contraption gained worldwide publicity. ... And Now The Second Setback The progress Union's station made after its first broadcast was substantiaL Thanks to better equipment and higher power,. twenty-three states, the District of Columbia, four Canadian provinces, and even steamships on the Atlantic Ocean were now able to receive the station. Unfortunately, however, broadcasting operations had to suffer yet another setback. Be- cause of increased competition from commercial stations, the Union College station was forced in l923 to return to its original function, experimenta- tion. Between 1923 and 1940, most of the work that the station did took the form of shortwave communications. In the mean- time, the station's call letters had changed from 2ADD to 2XQ to W2XBN. The Renaissance With the adoption of the car- rier current or \wired wireless'' transmitting technique in 1940, Union's station had reestablished itself. The first broadcast with this new technique took place on September22, 1941. Aroundthe same time, the station'.s call let- ters were changed to the current WRUC. A History of Relocating Since its initial stay in the shack, Union's station has been relocated several times. Other locations have included: Steinmetz Hall, Psi Upsilon House, Washburn Hall (now the area directly in front of the li- brary), Old Gym Hall (now Becker Hall), and Carnegie Hall (now the Old Chapel). Today, the studio is located on the sec- ond floor of the College Center. Power Increases Inl975, the Union College sta- tion switched to FM, operating at 10 watts, which just barely covered the Union campus. In 1983, a Federal Communications Commission ruling on public ra- dio stations required Union's sta- tion to increase its power to 100 watts. Now the station was able to cover Troy, Albany, and Schenectady. The Union Station Today In addition to \alternative\ music, the Union station broad- casts Dance music, Rap music, Classic Rock, Heavy Metal, Blues, Jazz, Country music, Folk music, Foreign Language Shows, and Sports Shows. Moreover, the station seeks to air more 1 ive talk shows with faculty members. The Union station continues to be run entirely by students, as it has been since 1920. This year's Program Manager is Amit Chopra. Other managers in- clude: Michael Rothstein, Chris Bryan, Dave Ovidovitz, and Andy Fradkin. The Music Di- rectors are Brianna Patnode and Marika Holland.

- Page BS · February 24, 1995 · The Concordien.sis Campus Life ALAS: Providing Students of Color with an Interactional Setting by Victor Owusu Contributing Writer The goal of any institution of higher learning, especially one that classifies itself as liberal arts, is to expose its students to a wide range of ideologies and modes of thinking. Indeed, many of the administrators and faculty here, at this fine institution, would agree with that assessment. In this re- gards, we are in congruence. The members of the Af- rican and Latino Al- liance of Students alas have committed themselves to help- ing Union attain its · ideal goal- one of cultural respect, progressive change, and intellectual het- erogeneity. The original pur- pose for the forma- • tion of ALAS is not surprising, consid- . ering the context of Union College. On a white majority campus, such as Union, people of color, specifically peoples of African and Latino descent, often feel disen- gaged and over- whelmed by the cul- tUJe shock. ALAS was, and continues to be, the medium through which a stu- dent-based support network for people of color can operate. A !though such in- formal networks surely existed be- fore the formation of ALAS. students of color needed an organizational base from which to initiate progressive action. Their omission from the campus consciousness spurred their formation, as it does our con- tinued political agitation. The first step in any organiza- tional based movement must be internal unity Therefore, the first few years of ALAS's existence consisted of inwardly focused goals. The club's agenda was to first organize and attempt to unite the people of color on the cam- pus before attacking issues in the campus community at-large This tad1c prmcd to be very effective. as unity would be essential in many subsequent obstacles which ALAS would face. .\::.part of the un1fy mg efforts or:\ LAS, many members li:lt that a common residence area for people of color would help de- crease alienation by providing a central cultural setting. It was at this point that the members of ALAS were forced to switch from their inner focus to outside forces. The idea was met with strong re- sistance from members of the College It is a fact that to this day, many people fervently dis- agree with the notion of cultural unity centers. However, it is with- out question that they provide stu- dents of color with an interac- tional setting without which many would feel lost. Nevertheless, the opposition to this idea was tre- mendous, and it forced ALAS members to engage the adminis- tration in a struggle for self-de- termination- a struggle that con- tinues to this day. This struggle consisted of pro- tests, letter writing campaigns, sit- ins, and whatever else was needed. The struggle was even- tually won, as the first cultural unity center was housed at Webster residence hall. How- ever, as students demanded a more centralized location, the center was moved from Webster House to Bronner House. Al- though many people have voiced their opposition, the most com- mon cry being that it allows stu- dents of color to segregate our- selves. Branner House continues to serve a vital function in the lives of many students on Union's campus. With a strong f~undation, the members of ALAS could now reach out to the general campus community to push forth their agenda This agenda is promoted on different levels a social level. a cultural level, and a political level This multifaceted attack has given people of color a voice that \VouiJ have othcf\\isc been drowned out On the social level, A LAS has, and continues to pro- vide social alternatives for its members. The social scene at Union College is a shock for many students of color who have not been exposed to it prior to their arrival. This, in tum, just adds on to the alienation felt by students when they enter the school. It is for this reason that ALAS provides these social alter- natives. Although social alterna- tives are not the most important service that is delivered, they are neverthelessan importantonethat eases the culture shock. The second level from which ALAS tries to reach the campus community, the cultural level, is very much intertwined with the political aspects of ALAS's func- tioning. Union College is a very homogenous school in terms ofits stuclent body distribution, and in terms ofthe intellectual priorities of the administration. To intro- duce a dissimilar culture has called for political action on the part of the students. It is true that the College has, for the most part, ¥i\,¢t~¥' supported speakers and groups that we have brought in fro;m the outs,ide to add a little cultural spice to this bland broth 'Which IS Union. However, consistent and dog- matic resis- tance to change in the intellec- tual infra- structure of Union con- tinues to make these outside in- jections of culture still necessary. Themem- of ALAS, and all the progressive segments of our institution, re- cently won a six year struggle to introduce Africana Studies to this campus. It is with sadness that I write the word \struggle.\ How an institution founded on the prin- ciples ofbroadening minds can so oppose a measure that intended to do just that is very sad, and at an- other level, very frightening. Still, with this example, it is easy to see how over time our cultural agenda has been closely linked with our political agenda, and how the lines have blurred. As with our struggle to intro- duce Africana Studies, many of our grievances deal with there- fusal of the institution to initiate progressive change. There are too many people at Union Col- lege who are satisfied with the status quo and are reluctant to embrace a diversity of thought. Although the administration has made some progressive change in the past few yearS, it has often been ,the case that those changes were instituted as a result of out- side pressure. Such reactionary measures do little to reassure ALAS members that there will be a continuity of progress, for there have been very few initiatory ac- tions taken by the administration. Up to now, I have listed gen- eral· areas of concern on Union's campus. However; there are some very concrete problems. Firstly, the striking dearth in the amount of professors and admin- istrators of co loris s.omething that most definitely needs to be ad- dressed. From all appearances, this is not a high priority of Union College. The stepstakentowards the recruitment of minority pro- fessors are negligible, if any. On this subject, I can speak from firsthand experience. As part of the vice-president of Academic Affairs/Dean of Faculty search committee last school year, it became abundantly clear to me that the school has no set affir- mative action guidelines for its hiring committees. Basically, the committee had to wing-it and' do what we thought would be effec- tive. This is very sad and very unjust. This school professes to be an affirmative action and equal opportunity employer. However, there are NO guidelines whatso- ever that pertain to that assertion for committees to follow. In addition, Union has no full- time affirmative action officer. The present affirmative action officer is also head of telecom- munications. This says nothing about her professional capabili- ties, but it is alt'tooclearthat less • attention equals a diminished ef- fectiveness.. The question then becomes whether Union is really committed to diversificatian or does it merely proclaim to be in order to silence the critics and maintait'l the normative standard? That is a question we should all ask ofthe administration. The curriculum is another area of concern for ALAS members. Specifica\ily; many people on campus view the Gen- Ed curricu- lum as very narrow and antitheti- cal to the definition of a liberal arts college, The unbending west- em focus of the curriculum in ef- fect establishes a very definite hierarchy of learning. A hierar-- chy which places Western history at the top, thereby limiting the intellectual. growth of its student body. At another level, it invali- dates the histories and contribu- tions ef other world cultures. Members of ALAS have been fighting, and will continue to fight to change this gross injustice. We have previously proposed that a fourth non-western history track be added to Track I of the gen-ed curriculum. That proposal was quickly killed without so much as an attempt' at a campus debate of the issue, Intellectual homogene- ity. What the African and Latino Alliance of Students has at- tempted to accomplish since its formation is to help Union Col- lege reach its ideal goals. We have bee.n more successful in some areas as opposed to others. However, we will continue to at- temptto broaden the institution's horizons. In thewordsof ALAS' present co-chair, Beverley Miller, \We are in an institution ofhigher yearning. It is our desire to trans- form it into a true institution of higher learning.\ The Union College Mission Statement; \ ... the College be- l:ieves that knowledge of the self is an important goal of liberal education, a goal that is best at- tained as one learns more about other cultures and one's own\ wh tirr set nal wa Co hac da; ofJ cia the ere de1 as' an me af an1 fot the vet Hu Th of~ car cei act tw( stit tor All rec «ki fri( cry fot wa nat l~c the obj an• cal ofl 1 sm fac Un ere the De list Tri 1 fat of ste: It i: Sig fot am pn• ofl the dal car I i sl lJn the leg occ niti erh I oth Phi 1-.

The objectives of the fraternity were an open discussion of philosophi- cal questions and the promotion ofthe ideals of friendship. The Kappa Alpha Society was small at first and opposed by the faculty and administration of Union College. Regardless, it se- cretly remained popular. In 1827 the Sigma Phi Society and the Delta Phi Fraternity were estab- 1 ished, forging the infallible Greek Triad. The Sigma Phi Society, founded on March 4, 1827. is one of the most conservative and steadfast fraternities in America. It is recorded that the founders of · Sigma Phi had already laid the foundations for the brotherhood and had selected new initiates prior to the official founding date of March 4, 1827. Once founded, the Sigma Phi society consoli- dated its position on Union's campus and in doing so estab- 1 ished a new precedent The Union Sigma Phi Society opened the Beta Chapter at Hamilton Col- lege in 1831. This was a landmark occasion in the history of frater- nities. Never before had a broth- erhood attempted to expand on to other campuses. Hence, the Sigma Phi Society was the pioneer be- hind the notion of intercol1egiate chapters. However, the conserva- tive nature of the fraternity inhib- ited the mass.ive proliferation of Sigma Phi nationally. Only six ad- ditional chapters had been es- tablished prior to the Civil W<\r.

Page 810 ·February 24, 1995 ·The Concordiensis Campus Life A Quarter Century ofCoeducation byKateDurocher Twenty-five years ago, Union opened its all male com- munity to go the way of Yale, Colgate, Bowdoin, and many other colleges and \co-Educate.\ The decision to co-educate was hastened when a Princdon University s~udy reported a growing disinterest in all male institu- tions on the part of male high school seniors. Only 3.3% of the male high school seniors surveyed said they would want to attend a single sex college or university. The alumni had spoken, and they were in favor of the change. The decision made, Union began preparing for female students. Union would not only be increasing its student body with females; it was also to increase enroll- ment by 1 00 female students each year for four years, bringing its total student body to 2000. ground to the competition that could well take ten years to regain.\ Therefore, in 1974, just four years after the initial switch to coeducation, Union Trustees decided to abolish the admissions quota for women. When the college first went co-ed, admissions tried to recruit women by saying, \Girls are imaginative, beauti- Today , enroiiment rem~ins at 2000, but the original number of 400 women have more than doubled.

Yet, in the end, the committee recommended co-educating. The reaction of students was also favorable. One cs- sa; supporting coeducation at Union suggested that, \It's a drag being without a chick all week. We, therefore, heartily endorse the Union College Faculty Committee on Coeducation's proposal to desegregate Union College. This would give Union students an opportunity to social- ize in a natural and nonnal way for the entire week.\ There was also mention in the article that \girls\ would bring to the classroom, \a variety of new opinions ... with the result of a general improvement in the academic at~o­ sphere.\ The reaction from alumni varied, but overall, they fa- vored coeducation by a ratio of 2:1. Some of the com- ments against admitting women included: \You would just be encouraging the population explosion.\ \A woman's place is in the home ... \\A once venerable and righteous institution has bitten the dust. .. \ One alumnus suggested that if Union went co-ed, they might want to change the motto to, \Under the laws of Venus we are all lovers.\ ful, coy, clever, funny, and accepted at Union!\ They also asked men for help in recruiting women, giving them advice to try to recruit \bright and pretty\ candidates to come to Union.

(In 1974-75 women's sports became partofthe intercollegiate athletic program). Judith Turkel, one of the first women at Union, reflects on her education. She writes, \Although care was taken intermittently to avoid blatant sexist discrimination, this small and protective environment might have been more supportive, responsive and less repres- sive of its emerging women than it was.\ Through her discomfort, along with other ac- tive women, they started the Women's Cau- cus in 1973-74. In turn, they also started work on a Women's Week, a Women's Cen- ter, and several Consciousness Rais.ing groups. This was met by a positive response. These comments proved to be in the minority, and the vast m3:jority wrote in favor of the decision with com- ments like: \Life is coeducational, colleges should be coeducational\ and \Discrimination of any sort, o~er than on a basis of academic ability ~nd performance should be avoided in progressive educational institutions.\ Soon, yet another problem arose. As J.A.D. Shupe '68, Director of Admissions, told the administrators and trustees, \I must be emphatic about the absolute necessity of avoiding a quota based on sex.

NEW YORK STARTINGIN 1970 The Undergraduate Yiew of Women at Union by Deborah Davis '74 fromApril/972 Union Chronicle The first year of coeducation at Union was a success in the sense that it offered a potentially unique experience to the women on campus. Since Union has been an all male institution for 175 years, our presence alone was a nov- elty, and we experience some favorit~ ism- fraternity parties in our honor, and living facilities that evoked jealousy from the unhappy occupants of South and West dormitories. Perhaps the ini- tial excitement of being a small minor~ ity will always be present for the incom- ing freshwomen, but for those of us who have lived through the first two years, the novelty has worn off and we are searching fora more realistic experience at Union. This is the point where some of the problems begin. In spite of coeducation, Union re- mains a man's world. The main reason for this situation is the unbalanced ra- tio between the male and female popu- lation. As long as women operate un- der the handicap of small numbers,. their influence on campus cannot be wide- spread. Women have been extremely active at Union: the editor of The Idol is a woman, and there is a female mem- ber ofthe All-College Senate. A cata- Iogue of achievement, however, does not respond to the problem at hand. A cata,.. Iogue of achievements, however, does not respond to the problem at hand. The basic question is, what adjustments has Union made that would change it from a mascu- line institution with a smattering of deco- rative coeds to an institution prepared to accommodate both men and women in their educational pursuits? One constant reminder that Union re- mains a men's school is the near absence of women on the faculty. To date, there are eight women on the teaching faculty, including part-time and full-time teachers. This scarcity of female professionals af- · fects students ofboth sexes. For it deprives them of the opportunity to come into con- tact with women on a sophisticated student/ teacher level. A similar situation can be found in 'the classroom, where there is a lack of realistic presentations of the im- pact of women on the academic world. Although this problem is not restricted to Union, it is an area that demands immedi- ate attention. An example of a biased ap- proach to education can be found in the anthology used by the Engiish Department in introductory courses. The two volume work includes six women in a survey of literature covering a period of approxi- mately 600 years. There are solutions to these problems, an4 Union seems to be making a genuine effort to correct many of these inequali- ties. Women are being hired for faculty positions in the near future. Whether this is a result of a sincere desire to correct the grossly unbalanced male-female teacher situation, or simply a ploy to avoid Fed- eral antidiscrimination moves, is unclear. The end result, however, will be to increase the number of faculty women. The problems concerning curriculum have been death with in two ways. Dur- ing the winter tenn of this year, a lecture/ discussion series was held'under the um- brella tit! e, \Conversations with Women,\ The series included such topics as women in literature, in law, in history, and in psy- chology. The discussions were held by professional women working in these fields who discussed their personal expe- . riences as well as the general attitudes to- ward women in their particular professions. This opportunity to learn abm1t women will extend to the classroom next year, when Union will offer two courses that place some emphasis on women. The College seems to have become aware that the mere physical presence of women on the campus does not create in- stant coeducation, and this awareness has produced some actions that will help to make the Union .experience a more mean- ingful one for women as well as for men. i' l l !. ).

The producing organization of the Mountebanks was founded in 1911, but dramatic presentations were being held as early as 1804. The name 'moumtebank\ comes from the Italian, used to \desig- nate vendors .of charms, drugs., and quick mepicines, who at- tracted purchases by improvised dramatic performances on the street.\ The group built their own theater in Hanna Hall and eventu- ally flourished into a fairly power- ful organization with the help of alumni, students and friends. Their workshop extended throughout the next decade and Mountebanks established them- selves in Hanna Hall with four dressing rooms, a workshop, a greenroom, and coat toom for guests. In a way, the new Yulman Theater is reminiscent of the very seeds thatstarted theaterat Union College. They organized an ex- ecutive committee which selected drama anq plays and production staffs, and wrote a constitution. These aspects of Mountebanks have held throughout the years and are still present today. Between the years of 1928-9, Mountebanks solidified into a concrete group largely impart to a wonderful dramatic coach, Ed- ward L. Carrol. Carrol had a won- derful record oftheater. Edward L. Carrol graduated from Union in 1927 and received his masters in English and drama at Columbia. At Union, he was heavily in- volved with Mountebanks hold- ing most positions including president. His ability at playing female roles since Union was all male at the time, won him much praise from drama critics. He was made class poet, elected to Phi Beta Kappa his senior year, and received the Blanchfordprize for the best address at this com• mencement. Carrol led .Mountebanks to much success throughout his years herCarrolled Mountebanks to much success throughout his years here. It is to his credit, the outlines of the Mountebanks or- ganization and all the aspects and rules needed to produce \good plays on campus.\ He stressed the need for theater at Union Col- lege for trained men in all aspects of theater i.e. acting, productions, etc. Carrol hoped for a new the- ater at Union to be built to insure that drama would have strong roots and become a large part of the undergraduate life and activi- ties. Interestingly enough, the En~ gtish department took Mounte- banks and drama under its wings, with professors who were willing to teach drama courses. William Toniski '29 current stage man- ' ' ager and others were intrigued with Hanna Hall, the new theater and the ability they would have at building scenery and proper- ties. This would be the first op- portunity the Mountebanks would have to become a theater group and have the ability to in- corporate all interested men into a very intimate group. At the time, plays and theater were a big business and a flour- ishing area that offered exciting and interesting careers. Theater and play productions were in- triguing things to get involved with, and Charles Perkins '29, busi- ness manager fully believe9 that Union should offer some formal training as a basis for this career path. There was a great drive by Carrol for the building of a formal theater where the dramatic/per- forming arts could have a home. Drama and theater became one of the most progressive and popu- lar forms of entertainment and ac- tivity on campus. Mountebanks became one ofthe few organiza- tions on campus to successfully produce and complete a major project every year. Eachproduction was well man- aged and 1 ed successfully. It be- came of much interest to build Hanna Hall, a new theater. A suit- able theater would cut costs and make theater a permanent aspect of campus life. Through hard work, and much financial depen- dency on students and faculty donations, a 300 person Hanna Hall theater was built, complete with a balcony. What errsued were two things: A wonderful area where drama could flourish, and immense debt that angered many, especially since students failed to contribute their share. Their first performance was a night of Three One Act Plays, including The Spend Thrifts, by Trtistian Ber- nard, The Hero of Santa Marra, by Kenneth Sawyer, and The Be- trayal, by Padriac Cilum. All di- rected and presented success- fully. Mountebanks has always had a history of wandering around, performing outside, inside, inclin- ing halls, lecture rooms, anywhere remotely resembling a stage. Thete has always been great de- tennination of the Mountebanks to keep theater alive no matter what. Above any organization it seems, Mountebanks is one of the mme dedicated and ambitious. Even if it means loafing around classrooms to perform. Since 1912, Mountebanks had been wandering around, using lawns for stages, and I iterally old drap- ery for scenery. Thursday April 16, 1928, Hanna Hall was opened. It was a portmanteau theater, a stage proscenium arch and strong, yet portable steel. While Hanna Hall was a dream of the technical staff because of its design, it was more the dream of Mountebanks. Throughout the years, Moun- tebanks has put on countless plays, too numerous to name them all, but here's a sampling: Whappin Wark, Trial By Jury, Twelfth Night, Both Your Houses, Oedipus, No More Peace, The Adding Machine, and Charles II, which of course makes for a shocking comparison to last terms' production set by Lee Bloomrosen. Affectionately termed the Mounties, their pro- ductions were the events where you took your date for an evening out. The theatrical aspect of Union and the Mountebanks was defi- nitely a great one. Mountebanks was once funded by outside pa- trons, and had such a grandeur Broadwayish aspect to it. Today, theater is still prevalent, though not as glamorous Back then, there were weekly updates on play rehearsals, and funny things that happened during them The cam- pus shared in the delight during all aspects of production. The ac- tion wasn't just shared by the ac- tors or the production staff The- ater truly encompassed all and took an interesting turn at the building of the Nott Memorial, which became the primary theater until just two years ago. Theater will always be alive at Union. The History of Sororities at Union by Caroline Paine News Editor One hundred and fifty- two years after the founding of the first fraternity at Union College, the first sisterhood was established. On November 20, 1977, Sigma Delta Tau installed its Beta Xi chapter at Union, beginning a proud history of sorority involve- ment to the existing greek tradi- tion. Since their founding they have been active in a variety of campus activities. Sigma Delta Tau has increased awareness on campus and raised funds for their philanthropy, the National Com- mittee.for the Prevention of Child Abuse. They have promoted this organization and also a sense of fun on campus through the Sigma Delta Tau annual M&M-athon and the sale of puzzle grams. The sisters of Sigma Delta Tau used their symbol ofajeweled torch to light the way for other fem'ale greek organizations to follow. The next year; a group of women, who had been living in aged to cooperate under this self- Richmond, founded a second all governing organization and sup- women's fraternity at Union.

They are Latino and African American organiza- tion. Omega Phi Beta's rituals and philosophies.are centered around ethnic related issues. Sigma Iota Alpha was established in 1994 and installed as an associate member of the Panhellenic Coun- cil this year. Their philosophy is to expand Latino culture to the community at large. They do not discriminate in their membership and have extended their member- ship to all cultures and races. The Panhellenic Creed states, \We the undergraduate members of women's fraternities, stand for good scholarship, for guarding of good health, for maintenance of fine standards, and for serving, to the best of our ability, our college community. Cooperation for fur- thering fraternity life, in hannony with its best possibilities, is the ideal that shall guide our frater- nity activities.\ Since the Council's creation, the members of the Panhellenic Council have strove to up hold this creed and \serve the college community and further fraternity life\ and will con- tinue to be an active part of cam- pus life in the future.

Campus Life 1960s and 1970s: An Era ofRebellion by Heather Manley/ Associate News Editor Union College does not have an extensive history of student protests. Like other institutions of higher education, the 1960s through the 1970s was an era .of protest. Beyond that, the stu- dents are historically rarely moved to action. During the 1950s, most COFI- cerns of students were within the college fences. Not until the 1960s did stud~nts focus concern on· national and international events. In the next few years, students became more involved with na- tional and international politics. The 1960s started the era of the Civil Rights Movement and Unites States' involvement in Southeast Asia. It also became the era in which the country be- gan to doubt its government, anq Union College resonated this idea. Student participation in cam- pus acHvities dropped from 1000 to 750 over three years in the 1960s. In 1 960, the campus concern was racial equaHty, reflective of the Civil Rights Movement occur- ring nationwide. That year, some fraternities initiated African- Americans for the firsttime. On some occasions, alumni withdrew from the fraternity in response to these actions. In 1968, a group of students lowered the campus flag to half mast to \mourn the condition of the country.\ Another group of patriotic students responded by raising- the flag in protest of the abuse of this national symbol. This pattern continued several times throughout the day aecoin·· ~ · parried by heated dialogues about . the war in Vietnam and Vice J,Jresi- dent Spiro Agnew. One student ~commented that the mourners were patriotic, as well, because theyonly lowered the flag and did not burn it. One of the biggest fonns of stu- dent protest occurred in 1969. The Students Social Action Commit- tee sponsored the college's par- ticipation in the National Vietnam Moratorium to protest the war. The nonviolent moratorium, which was endorsed by the college's president, Harold C. Martin, included a protest march in Schenectady, lectures; seminars and documentaries. Students also requested that classes be canceled that day. Although the faculty voted against it, President Martin asked that students not be penalized formissingclass on that day. The march started at the Nott Memorial and continued onto Nott Terrace and State Street. It was followed by door to door canvassing to remind people The Concordiensis · February 24, 1995 · Page B13 Students protest tile Vietnam war on the campus. The 1960s/1970s saw an influx in student activism about the war and ask them to write their congressmen in protest of the war. Roughly 3000demon- strators took part in the morato- rium including approximately two thirds of the student body. A month later, students from Union and Skidmore Colleges chartered buses to go to Washington, D.C. to participate in a protest spon- sored by the New Mobilization Against the War in Vietnam. 1970 started the main period of protest at Union. In early May of 1970, President Nixon announced that the United States was send- ing troops to Cambodia. That .night, students held a rally at the flagpole and burned a life size rep- JicaofNixon if effigy, gaining na- tional press coverage. Students chanted slogans like, \We don't want Nixon's war,\ and marched across Nott Terrace up to the main gate of the General Electric plant. Students sat down and attempted to block access to GE, the second largest defense contractor in the nation. Students also moved for the elimination ofthe Reserve Of- ficers Training Corps (ROTC) from the campus. Twenty-five stu- dents tried to prevent access to the ROTC building a held and rally in protest. Later that month, the \Union Strike Committee\ presented President Martin with a petition of900 signatures requesting that classes be canceled to allow par- ticipation in protest activities fol- lowing the deaths of four students at Kent State This time, the fac- ulty agreed. as long as the day be used for \meaningful alternate activity.\ 600 people, including both students and faculty partici- pated in seminars and speeches. 150 draft cards were collected Again, the event gained national press coverage In May of I en I . protests took a different tum A group of approxi- mately fifteen African-American students entered the computer center, asked personnel to leave and forcibly ejected an adminis- trator who had entered. They held a sit-in. demanding that the Black steps of the Memorial Cl~apeL Student Alliance be given a build- ing on Lenox A venue for use as a cultura'l center, an increase in schelarships and that no disci- plinary action be taken against the protesters. The sit-in received little support from the student body. The administration ob- tained a judicial restraining order to clear the building, but the pro- testers left on their own. A few days later, a small groups of Caucasian students moved in to the Administration Building and made the same demands as the preceding group. They also demanded a complete reappraisal and examination of the college budget by the general college community. that the college's in- vestment portfolio he open for inspection and that the students meet \\:ith trustees to discuss ··cor- porate endowment\ President Martin offered to meet with three memhcrs ofthc group if they len the building without harming it, which they did As a result, nine- teen students were brought be- tore the Discipline Committee tor hearings. The penalties ranged from a two hundred dollar tine and disciplinary probation to an offi- cial ~eprimand At Commencement Exercises that same year. a few students began shouting obscenities and prevented any spc3kcrs from speaking The ceremony stopped completely until the hecklers gave up their efforts. Later. students marched into Library Plaza carry- ing what was thought to be the flag of North Vietnam. Dennis Peskin. class of\66 and part time employee of the Eng I ish depart- ment. led the protest The scene ended when Professor Ted Bick of the Math department, as well as a member of the class of '58, wrestled Peskin down. Other protests of the period in- clude speeches given by Jane Fonda and Tom Hyden in Memo- rial Chapel on Nixon's policies and downfalls. One of the last efforts atoppos- ing the war in Vietnam was a si- lent protest in May of 1972. Stu- dents marched from the campus to Veteran's Park in Schenectady and silently mourned the war. That too was followed by can- vassing in the community and the distribution oflcatlets In the spirit of the times, Union has had its share of unrest How- ever, overall, the students have not been easily moved to protest.

In the same year, the college also instituted a flight instruction course for physically- qualified cadets interested in be- coming Air Force pilots. The AFROTC program at Union was broken up into four parts: in the first year, a cadet was taught the concepts of \power force and expediency;\ his sec- ond year was spent learning about Aerospace Weapons Systems; his third year instructions in- volved preparation and training of the Air Force Officer; and in his final year the cadet dealt with international affairs. In addition to the academic agenda, the AFROTC program offered a host of extra-curricular activities in- cluding drill and rifle. competi- tions and membership in the Arnold Air Society (the honorary Air Force organization on cam- pus).

The turning point, however, for the curriculum was the completion of such engineering feats as the Erie Canal, and the Mohawk and Hudson Railway. New advances in applicable science prompted professors to rethink their methods of education. Eliphalet Nott had patented boilers, which were used on river boats on the Hudson. These advances and other factors led Nott to his greatest curricular innova- tion, and Engineering sequence. At the age of 72, Nott bl'!gan to r,e- construct the science and engin.eering curriculum. At the same time other col- leges and universities were particularly dogmatic in their curricuta plans, and Jacked the practical experience Nott had. Nott had some success while he served as president ofthe Rensselaer Institute. He offered a vocational sequence for students who did not chose to pursue an academic background. In 1835, RPI began a one year applied civil engineer- ing course, which was later expanded to a three year course. William Gillespie came to Union in 1845, and was assigned the dubious task of implementing the engineer- ing program. Gillespie's career be- gan at Columbia University and which landed him a position at the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees in Paris. With this strong on site expe- rience, Gillespie designed Union's program, stressing a strong founda- tion in the sciences, mathematic_s, and liberal arts. Gillespie saw the unique need for' th,e introducti9n,o(. new technologies. into the curricu-. . lum,. and began a series .of period lectt.tres, which stressed modem ad- vances.

He thought that engineers needed strengthening in mathematics, science and the liberal arts. He began to redirect Union by requiring a surveying course for all sci- ence majors, and an optional topogra- phy course. The new plan took full ef- fect in 1845 as an extension ofthe sci- ence program. The course work was geared mostly for upperclassmen -and has been noted as one of the few sue- · cessful engineering pmgrams leading to a B.A ..

I·~ Science & Engineering Engineering at Union College has experienced a proud and dis- tinguished history. Graduates and professors from our school have continued to become inventors, heads of businesses, and promi- nent figures in society. The rela- tively few number of graduates makes one believe that the pro- grams at Union are somewhat spe- cial aFid unique. This result did not happen by chance. The engi- neering programs had to be de- veloped on a solid foundation. One man to be credited with this unique and challenging curricu- lum is Charles Proteus Steinmetz. Charles Steinmetz (born Karl August Rudolf Steinmetz), was born in Breslau, Germany on April 9, 1865. Hereceived a classical education with an emphasis on mathematics and sciences. He also received a mechanical engi- neering degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. He was forced to flee to the United States in 18 89, where he was able . _ to secure a job with a small elec- trical manufatcurung company in Yonkers, New York. During this period, he discovered how hys- teresis loss in iron varies, a prin- ciple called \Steinmetz Law,\ a law that is still taught in today's sophomore circuits classes every- where. In 1894, he was hired by Gen- eral Electric's Schenectady divi- sion as head of the Calculating De- partment. By 1902, he was the Chief Consulting Engineer of the General Electric Company, elected president ofthe American Insti- tute of Electrical Engineers, and regarded as the leading electrical engineer in the United States. Electrical Engineering was a young science and not well taught among the major institutions of the United States. General Elec- tric recognized the need for proper education of its engineers and sought Union College's help in this quest. The department had begun modestly in 1894 with a graduating class of three to six per year. General Electric offered to furnish a substantial amount of electrical laboratory equipment to the College every year for five yeats if the school would support the program with matching funds. Most importantly, the. company Dr. Steinmetz with fragments of tree bran ell damaged by required that the school hire \the foremost representative of electri- cal science in America, and there- fore the world,\ Mr. C. P. Steinmetz, to take charge of the instruction and be appointed Pro- fessor of Electrical Engineering at Union College. Union College was now hold- ing the bestelectric~;tl engineering course in the country. Students from all parts of the country turned to Union College to learn this sci- ence with the best facilities, and the foremost authority of the sub- ject in the world. Steinmetz revealed his reasons for accepting this position in a 1902 edition of The Concordien- sis which he began: \The reasons which led me to undertake the organization and direction of the Electrical Engi- neering course ofUnion College were that the conditions here are unsusually favorable for an elec- trical engineering school, supe- rior to any, due to the old and well established reputation ofthe Col- lege in engineering education and proximity and favorable disposi- tion of the largest electrical manu- facturing company.\ Steinmetz started a curriculum that included both this technical specialism and study of the clas- sic-s. He recognized how little of a subject that a student knows at Tbe CQntordiensis ·February .24, 1995 ·Page 817 the time of graduation. This led him to a radical suggestion at the time, that the curriculum should involve constructive use of the principles taught in earlier courses, and that every subject not tied into this scheme would be dropped. Faculty members were concerned with a change in curriculum focusing on such a narrow technical field but Steinmetz assured them of his in- tent to leave the general cultural studies intact: \the first condi- tion which the college should ful- fill is tum out educated men and not mere trained artisans.\ Steinmetz followed this liberal philosophy in his own life. When Steinmetz moved to Schenectady in 1894, he started the world's first glider club, the Mohawk Aerial Navigation Company. The club consisted of Steinmetz and fellow employees at General Electric, who formed a society that focused on building a manned glider, or kite. This society helped to de- fine the basic concepts for human flight and actually performed flight trials nearly a decade before the Wright brothers' first flight. The club started off with a wooden glider and moved on to using modern materials such as steel and aluminum. The society did not have a successful flight in the summer of 1894, and dis- banded when the winter weather arrived. The most amazing facet of this man lies in his intensity and de- votion to his work. Steinmetz was the headofthe electrical engineer- ing department for ten years. He had an understanding of the engineer's role in the modern world, well in advance of most contemporary thought of that day. In that time, he continued to work full-time at General Electric pio11eering methods of under- standing alternating power sys- tems. He publi'shed five electrical engineering books, making a to- tal of seven in his career, andre- ceived over 300 patents while working at G. E. His influence .on students was profound. His lectures were de- livered with such enthusiasm that students were inspired to learn the material. His patience and willing- ness to listen to students was al- most a fault. Members of Phi Gamma Delta fratemnity even in- vited him to become a brother. Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the first head of Union's electrical engineering department, under- stood the principles of alternat- ing current, and shared his under- standing with his students He understood and taught these prin- ciples to Union students as they were being discovered. An op- portunity that does not come very often to undergraduates. He ush- ered in the modem engineering curriculum and enhanced the reputation of Union College to .that of one of the premiere instituitions in the country. Dr. Charles Hurd and Undergraduate Research in Chemistry by Matthew Lann Contributing Writer Chemistry has been a part of Union College since the mid 1800's. Around 1900, Edward Ellery became the chair ofthe de- partment He took the one or two professor department that he in- herited, and by about 1920 made a B.S. degree in chemistry at Union a possibility. One of his best additions was that of Dr. Charles Hurd. Hurd received both his B.S. and M.S. in chemistry from Worcester Poly- technic-in 1915and l917,respec- tively. In 1923, two years after earning his Ph.D. ft;om Clark Uni- versity in Physical Chemistry, Hurd was hired by the Chemistry department and soon became an instrumental part of undergradu- ate research inChemistry. HisaP:. pointment was based on the no- tion of a required course in inde- pendent research for those trying to obtain.a B.S. in Chemistry. Initially, Dr. Hurd's interest was in the stability constants of cal- cium hydride and calcium azide. However. soon after coming to Union, the topic of his studies changed to Colloid Chemistry. Essentially~ Hurd and his students studied the effects of one variable such as temperature, pH, or salt concentration and the time it took for silicic acid gels to set. One of the reasons why so many papers were published in his thirty-five years at Union was the sirnplicity <?fhis apparatus. All components were mixed together and allowed to set for a given time. Then, ac- cording to page 604 of the 1932 issue of The Journal of Physical Chemistry , a short glass rod at an angle of twenty degrees from the vertical was placed in the mix- ture. If the rod fell over, the gel was not set~ if it stayed upright~ then setting had occurred. This procedure was relatively inexpen- sive and due to the variety of vari- ables was an endless supply of experiments. The idea of research at a small college such as Union and par- ticularly work done by under- graduates was looked down upon in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1936, President Rob- ert Hutchins of the University of Chicago said inaspeechatOberlin thatthe function ofthe college is to teach. It is not to condu((t sci\ entific investigation or profes';\ sional training. The responsibil- ity of adding to theworld'sknowl- edge does not rest upon the col- lege. Jts object is to communicate it. Perhaps Hurd ,belonged at a large university. Most ofhis time was spent on research, and not teaching. In fact, according to one of Hurd's students in a letter to Professor Werner, Hurd's pri- orities were quite clear. His lec- ture notes for Chern i.cal Thermo- dynamics remained unchanged for fifteen years. However, because of Hurd, Union was able to be- come one of the most published colleges in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. In fact, between the years of 1927 and 1 941 , Union was twelfth on a list of colleges that included Wil- liams, Hobart, and Amherst. Al.ong with the hardships of World War ll came a decline in research at small colleges. Fund- ing was scarce, especially for schools such as Mount Holyoke, Union, and Oberlin. Fortunately, many chemists at top research in- stitutions such as Brown and MIT realized the hazards of concentrat- ing· an research at large universi- ties. They wanted to balance the amount ofmoney allotted for re- search in chemistry to include small colleges. This gave Union the chance to be among the lead- ing sources for doctorates in Chemistry. Dr. Charles Hurd was an es- teemed member ofthe faculty for a long time. Toward the end of his career, he stated, \ In nearly thirty years of research on and publication of articles concerning the setting of sit icic acid gels, I have been able to contribute to the literature and to make the name of Union College significant in this field. However, the greatest result probably is the fact that a good many young men, training to be chemists; had their first ex- perience in this tield.u He was thesis advisor for 128 seniors and twenty-three masters candidates, as well as author of thirty- tive jour- nal articles, many ofwhich were co-authored by his students.

Union was lucky to persuade Dr. Roth to leave his position of teaching and research- ing at Harvard University to head and moderniLe the Biology De- partment, and to create a modern Pre-Medical Department. Coming to Union was an easy decision to make for Dr. Roth,'\[ As a] graduate of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, I was addicted to smaller I iberal arts college-types So, Roth and his colleagues set outto create the broad department that we have today. One that sends people to careers in Biol- ogy, graduate school and medical school. When asked about today's Bi~logy Department, \The Biology Department will continue to be extremely strong and will be one of the leading academic focuses on campus ... We currently offer a larger number and a greater variety of undergraduate biology courses than almost any liberal arts college I know .. \ of education. When an opportu- nity came up at Union, to work with Pre-Medical students and also to teach undergraduates, I liked it.\ In fact, it was his love for teaching that caused him to take an academic medical Ph.D. over a clinical MD. Roth comments: \\the Biology De- partment will continue to be ex- tremely strong, and will be one of the leading academic focuses on campus. We have succeeded in building a broad, inclusive depart- ment. We [Union] currently offer a larger number and a greater va- riety of undergraduate biology courses than almost any liberal arts college I know.

(plroto by Laurel Ruma/TC) Vv11en Roth arrived·at Union, he arrived in a department that was \very solid, but tor many years was a service department to Pre- Meds. The year I came, we gradu- ated exactly two majors in Biol- ogy.\ The time period of Roth's arrival marked a time ripe for the expansion of the department into more than what it had been. \'Bi- ology was exploding all over the Although Dr. Roth is pleased with the strength of the depart- ment, he still strongly believes in the liberal arts education that he himself, has had. \I do not be~ I ieve that we should, primarily at this level, be graduating special- ists. I do not want to train mo- lecular biologists, theoretical physicists, organic chemists, or novelists at the undergraduate level. What I want to see at the undergraduate level, is you don't prepare a student to go out and assume a career, you want to pre- pare a person to go out and figure out what career they now want to study. I am saddened that many of the departments at the school Undergraduate Research and Dr. Hurd Continuedfrompage B17 Some of these fine students be- came quite prominent in the field of Chemistry; they included Presidents and CEOs of Shell, Dupont and Eastman Kodak, re- search directors at Bell Labs and Lever Brothers, a vice-president ofPfizer, inc. and faculty at eight colleges and universities. In 1950, much to the dismay of Dr. Hurd and the Chemistry department, the President and Trustees of the College forced the elimination the undergradu- ate research program. He was asked to step down from his position as chair in 1956 and was essentially forced to retire in 1959, after thirty-six years at Union. Dr. Hurd is one of the reasons that Chemistry at Union is so strong. In fact, the year he retired, eighteen foundations sent representatives to the first symposium on Rese_€lrch and Teaching in the American Col- lege, which was held at the Col- lege of Wooster. The general consensus of this conference was that small colleges do in fact play an important role in the education of future scientists.

I think it is becoming more difficult for Union to main- tain a liberal arts posture.\ As a remedy to this problem, Roth would like to see depart- ments encouraging their students to explore other fields broadly. Roth mentions a colleague at Harvard who considered that the only proper education for medi- cal school was two years of study- i ngJ iterature because, \Great au- thors survived as great authors because they wmte knowingly about people. People is what medicine is all about.\ Aside from his duties at the school, Dr. Roth is involved with COOL, The Campus Outreach Opportunity League. It is a multi- college group that concentrates in getting college students in- volved more directly with the community. \This group goes beyond do-gooding. It gives students ... the opportunitY to be involved in communities around the school, as well as communi- ties such as the United Nations, or the national political arena. It is a deeper sense of concern and compassion than simply 'do- gooding.,;, Involvement in the community brought us to another topic, the changing relationship between Union and Schenectady. \Al- though my involvement with Schenectady has been limited, I don't p~rceive the relationship of the College with the community as being changed that much, ex- cept that I am very much heart- ened by President H uU' s attempt to do, and be more positive.'' But how does Roth perceive the re~ cent maelstrom, that seems to be headed to the courtroom? \I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't followed it very carefully .. .I think it's basically trivial. Hisarelative minor type of problem. I don't see it generating .. .ill feeling between Schenectady and the College. I think that there has been more of an effort to involve us in the com- nmnity than in previous years.\ Doctor Roth's long car:eer has seen. many changes at Union, but some things do not change: 'The pre-med student of 1967 was very like the pre-med student of 1995. When 1 came, things were very competitive ... and this year is go- ing to be the most competitive yearto get into medical school.\ One ·Of the most .significant changes was the inclusion of women into the college in 1970, but Dr. Roth was not surprised by it. \I came from the mid-west where we didn't have sex-segre- gated education. I went to Swarthmore and Harvard which were co-ed. I was jolted when I came here. To me it was kind of an alien existence, the aU-male ex- istence, and I didn't like it. I found certain crudities that I think did not exist when tempered by the presence of women.\ Roth re- ported thattherewerea largenum- ber of faculty who were opposed to having women attend Union. Some faculty threatened to resign, but few actually did. \There was a strong hostility and no real an- ticipation that 'this was great, this was wonderful'. The student body was sort of split.\ Dr. Roth reported that the first women were \very capable,\ and attracted can- didates that wanted a liberal arts school that was strong in the sci- ences and engineering. \I still treasure some of the women in those first few classes who went on to medical school. They put up with a lot of unpleasantness. It was not that they were badly treated, it was just that they were not well treated. Their needs were not particularly recognized. It was tough. The ones I knew were strong.\ As for changes, the very medi- cal profession that Dr. Roth has been involved with is slowly headed down a path of change. \We have the best health care system in th~ world. We just have a delivery problem. We're going to se_e fewer of the clinical spe- cialties, and more of what we call the primary care physicians. We are going to have to pay an inter- nist that devotes a half hour to taking a careful case history as much as the dermatologist that spends two seconds burning off a wart. That is going to change; medical education has already started that change. This has al- ready made liars out of fifty per- cent of this year's applicant class. One hundred percent of this year's class will assure you that they want to go into primary care. l think it will operate to change the nature of pre-medical educa- tion. We do not need physicians that are aU potential N obellaure- ates in science. We need mote of an emphasis on our classic com- munication skills.\ Although Dr. Roth is leaving at the end of the year, he plans to remain affiliated with pre-medical students, as a consultant, per- haps ev~n in Schenectady. One thing is for certain, Dr. Roth has led a distinguished career, and in his absence, he will be missed. c w oJ tv \' tb b< B E G C{ fa ri w gl pl cc f<: cc p Sl e: A G fl s 1 tl a 11 \l p 1 ti a q jl r I ), t ( .._ t r

In 1955, George Westinghouse was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. In the 55 years since its establishment in 1900, only 85 other Americans were so- honored. History regards Westinghouse as an exceptional inventor, a fine financier, and a humanitarian, whose business practices underscored his great commitment to company employees. The Westinghouse Corporation grew tremendously during times when militant labor movements created havoc for other companies. In 1887, the Westinghouse corporation inaugurated the Saturday half holiday for employees, the first step towards the implementation of a five-day work week. Subs.equently, Westinghouse established a pension plan for employees, and incorporated a system of paid vacations for workers. Westinghouse's remarkable life came to an end on March 12, 1914 in New York City, and his wife perished three months later. He received 361 patents over the course of 48 years, averaging a new patent every six weeks. Westinghouse's financial windfalls, coming largely from his invention of the air brake, enabled him to organize or finance more than sixty companies. George Westinghouse Jr.'s legacy will endure.

Page B20 · February 24, 1995 · The Concordiensi·s Science & Engineering Biology Has Grown D~amatically in last 75 X ears by Scott Steele Concordiellsis Staff The biology department at Union College has been through many transitions. These transi- tions consist ofchanges in cur- riculum, faculty and location. In 1916, the biology department at Union College consisted of one young instructor on the second floor of the old chapel. There were only about twenty-five biology students at the time. The biology program began to grow in 1926 when the department included a professor, an assistant professor, an instructor and approximately two hundred students enrolled in biology courses. There was a large emphasis on laboratory training for these students. This emphasis on laboratory training has become a trademark of the bi- ology department over its long l~istory. At this time,. the formation of biology departments was a new idea. Biology was just starting to shed an image of dissecting plants and animals and labeling them with a complex name. The study of life gained merit in itself and biology was regarded as a funda- mental science. Biology was con- sidered the science most appli- cable to humans and a science that could provide a foundation for studies in the other fields. Biology at Union became are- quired class for all freshmen and began to occupy a prominent place in college-curriculum. The department also began to grow in otherwaysaswell. Funding from grants and donations allowed the school to remodel its cat anatomy lab and to add a greenhouse to its existing facilities. The department was very concerned with creating a \successful\ pool of graduates. After all, the s~;~ccess of the gradu- ates reflected upon the depart- ment and school. In 1926, the goal of the department was to offer pro- fessional courses to prepare stu- dents for careers in medicine. The department also offered students courses in botany and other bio- logical fields and provided stu- dents with a foundation for the study of other sciences such as sociology and psychology. Union College's Biology de- partment has also traveled through many locations and fa~ cilities in its history. Shortly after 1917 the Butterfield Memorial Laboratory was built. The chem- istry department moved into this building, which allowed the biol- ogy department to relocate into the North Colonnade. This gave the department increased space and provided a location for a com- parative anatomy laboratory. In 1923, the old 'Benedict Barn\ which adjoined Jackson's Gar- dens,. was remodeled and occu~ pied by the biology department It was later used for courses in heredity and botany. ln 1926, a greenhouse was donated to the college by Ludlow L. Melius, '96, and built in the back of North Col- lege. During that year the biol- ogy department also acquired rooms from the physics depart- ment, which it converted into freshmen laboratories. Due to the growth of the freshmen course in biology, further classroom space became necessary. In orderto ac- commodate these needs the sec- ond floor was used in the North Colopnade and biology classes were held in other buildings across campus, The department was beginning to expand but still lacked an adequate location. Fi- nally, when Electrical Engineering moved its laboratory, President Day allowed the biology depart- ment to move into a more modem building that provided a more cen- tral location on campus. This area also provided for larger, better equipped laboratories. During this time new courses were of- fered. Some of these included: embryology, general histology and a course on the human body for those not interested in medi- cine. In the time up until 1955 little had changed in the size and di- versity of the department. The department consisted of five fac- ulty and offered five two-semes- ter courses every year. These courses consisted of general bi- ology, human biology, compara- tive anatomy, embryology and general physiology. Other classes also became offered occasionally throughout the year. Some of these included genetics, botany, invertebrate zoology and neuro- biology. Many students during this time were 'general science' majors and the department only graduated two to five regular bi- ology majors per year. In the late 1950's, there was a true science explosion. Beginning with the launching of the first man into space, a series of events led to a stronger national educational em- phasis on the sciences. Enroll- ments in the sciences also began to increase drastically. A combi- nation of increased emphasis in the fields of cellular and molecu~ Jar biology and a growing concern 1970 the department moved into its current quarters in the science and engineeringbuilding. The de- partment was provided with ad- vanced laboratory and research facilities. and state of the art equip- ment. Enrollments in the depart- ment began to increase rapidly and between 1967 and 1971. Six new, tenure-track faculty positions were added. In the new trimester for the environment seemed to result in increased student inter- est in the biological sciences. In 1959, the department was awarded with a National Science Founda- tion (NSF) grant of 50,000 dollars, that was matched by the college. This grant allowed for improve- ment in laboratory equipment and programs for the department. Through the next four years in- creased enrollments and over- loaded professors resulted in a rapid expansion for the depart- ment. system, each faculty member could effer a specialized upper- level course and independent stu- dent research in their particular field. Beginning in 1972, the depart- ment adopted a \core program\. This required all majors to take four basic classes including: zo- ology, botany, cell biology and ge- netics. Classes such as ecology allowed for trips to local nature preserves. These courses contin- ued to provide students with ex- cellent hands-on field studies In 1980 F.L Lambert became chair- person on an interim basis and was succeeded by P.L. Tobiessen in 1983. Requirements for majors were altered and a subprogram for the neural sc.iences was devel- oped, based on cellular and be- havioral neurophysiology courses in both biology and psy- chology. During this time there was an increase in interdepart- mental majors and this trend con- tinues today. In 1989 George Butterstein succeeded Peter Tobiessen as chairperson. Through the years between 1989 and 1992 the department re- sponded to explosions in the fields of molecular and cellular biology and biochemistry. The depart- ment added three new faculty members whose research was in these fields. In 1993 Twitty J. Styles became chairperson and currently holds the .position to- day. Today the department has 17 faculty members (14 tenure track positions and three visiting mem- bers) and is the largestdepartment · on campus. The department has 252 full majors, 106 LD. majors and 78 majors who are members of the seven- year medical program. This gives a total of 438 students. Beginning in the middle 1960's, the trustees ofthe college made a decision to increase the size of the student body to 2000 undergradu- ates. Under the leadership of Dean James Palmer a new science and engineering building wa·s planned. There was a push to- ward increased emphasis on fac- ulty research and the recruitment of new faculty. Union adopted a trimester system and an altered general curriculum for its stu- dents. The biology department played roles in these crucial changes. L.B. Clark, chairperson since 1949, retired in 1967 and was replaced by W.D. Roth. The de- partment then moved to Bailey Hall, until construction ofthe new · science center was complete. ln ·The department received two Howard Hughes: grants in 1988 and 1993. Awards such as these place the department among the top liberal arts sCience programs in the country. In 1994, the de- partment received an NSF grant to establish a cellular and molecu- lar biochemistry laboratory for undergraduate teaching and re- search. On average the depart- mentnow offers Twenty-ninedif~ ferent courses per year. Although the core courses in biology have varied little in recent liistory, up- per level courses have grown greatly and rapid-ly diversified. Coursesare offered in areas-of mo- lecular biology, cell biology, im- munology, neurobiology, ecol- ogy, botany, anatomy, biochem- istry, and physiology. The aver- age size ofthese classes is about 25 students. Almost all of these classes contain laboratories, which the department has always seen as being a vital component to learning science. As a student of biology I be- lieve that there are two keys to the success of the department. One is the faculty and the other being the student research that is available. The faculty in the biol- ogy department is thought of in a special way by most of its majors. There is a feeling that the faculty truly wants to help the students and that they are concerned with the progress of their students. This in tum drives many students to work as hard as they can and hopefully achieve their maximum capabilities. In this way the stu- dents are not satisfied with giv- ingjust the minimum amount of effort needed to pass but feel motivated to challenge them- selves and to discover their true potential. Not only for their in- structors but for themselves as well. The opportunities to do re- search that the department pro- vides for students are also very vital. Since the department has no 'graduate' Students, under- graduates can partake in many research opportunities that are unavailable at many other institu- tions. These types of projects range from one-teiln projects to multiple term projects that often culminate into an honor's thesis. The department encourages its students to apply for internships and research opportunities at other institutions both for the summer and during the academic year. The opportunity to do re~ search is.something that provides much knowledge ofhow labora- tories work, and provides a set~ ting for professors and students to work closely together. Through all the department has done over the years it has always maintained the highest integrity for its q ualtty ofeducation and in its concern fo\f its students.

Stu- dents and membersoftheCollege community alike can learn a great deal about science at Union dur- ing its first hundred yearsfrom the book aAd much about science in the last century by speaking wit11 Professor Pilcher in person. V. Ennis PilcherearnedhisA.B. and M.A. from Emory University and his Ph.D. from North Carolina State. Priorto his arrival at Union, Professor Pilcher worked for four years at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island as a research scientist. When an op- portunity in the Physics depart- ment opened up at Union, Pilcher took the position and the union of the two since has been a glori- ous one. Professor Pilcher is the second longest tenured professor the Physics department has ever had, scrv ing for more than thirty years. During his tenure at Union, Pilcher always believed in the need for hands-on experience and thus tried to follow the tradition at Union.

This problem stems from the present fear associated with physics. As a nuclear physi- cist by trait, Pilcher feels that phys- ics is disguised by the fear of nuclear energy. He says the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine was invented by physi- cists and that almost every hos- pital has a particle accelerator, however, they are kept hidden be- cause of the fear. He stated, \What are docturs and scientists going to do without physics re- search in the next l 00 years.\ The conversati<m shifted gears as Professor Pilcher began to dis- cuss changes that have occurred at the College during his associa- tion.

He feels that the move was a big mistake and that it has hurt the students the most. Prior to the trimester system, physics students gained much more labo- ratory experience and he sternly believes the College should return to the semester system. Finally, Professor Pilcher feels that the amount ofbasic science required at Union has steadily declined and he feels that this needs to change, because the students need the ba- sic sciences. As the bicentennial nears, I asked Professor Pilcher how he wanted to be remembered when the school writes its history for the tricentennial, and he said that he wanted to be remembered as, \A teacher during the Golden Era of Physics, because of the great support, number and quality of students that came through here\ This statement exemplifies V. Ennis Pilcher. He does not only wants to be remembered for what he did, but for the fact that he got to teach some of the great physi- cists to come out of Union in the post-World Warii period.

Page B22 · February 24, 1995 · The Concordiensis Science & Engineering History of the Geology Department at Union College by April Bemis Contributing Writer The Geology Department be- gan at Union in 1809, when Tho- mas Brownell was hired to teach a course in mineralogy. Atthattime, mineralogy was closely allied to chemistry, which was also under his purview. Brownell was dis- patched to Europe to study and purchase specimens, instructional aids, and apparati for teaching the new courses. During the following ten years, he added to them ineral col\lection through his o\\n efforts in the field and donations from alumni and others He maintained a partial catalogue ofthe collection, which numbered about 2000 specimens when he left.

In 1865, Maurice Perkins took over after Chandler, including duties as museum cura- tor. Alumnus Harrison Webster joined the faculty as a tutor in Natural History in 1868, and soon advanced to a regular faculty po- sition Webster was a major actor in the taculty movement oppos- ing President Potter during this time and he left the College for Rochester His replacement was another alumnus, James Stoller ('84), first as a tutor then as a pro- fessor. Stoller's duties increased until the departure of Jonathan Pearson in 1885. Webster re- turned to the College as its presi- dent in 18 88, and he again taught in the department of biology and geology. The first full-fledged geologist to Union College faculty, Charles S. Prosser, was added in 1894. As the acting Professor ofGeol- ogy,hewas responsible for the de- partment of Geology and Paleon- tology. At this point there was a fairlv com- · plete cur- riculum in geology. T h e Wheatley Collection had become part of the Geology Department in 1890,and during his brief stay at the college (until1899), Prosser put consider- able efforts into rehabili- tating and adding to the collec- tion, espe- cially with pa I eonto- logic speci- m e n s Prosser's amhit ions for a strong Geologyde- partment appears to have ini- Department for thirty-five years, from the retirement ofStoller in 1925, until1960.

He left for Ohio State where he soon hecame chairofthe Geology department there. Stoller resumed responsibility for geology and curation of the collections when Prosser left Stoller, although primarily trained as a biologist, carried out some very significant early work on the surficial and glacial geology of the Mohawk-Hudson region. Stoller's divided responsibilities led to a reduction in course offer- ings in geology for the next 20 years, but continued as part of the Biology and Geology Department. The mineral collections contin- ued to be an important educa- tional asset, and were curated by a volunteer, Dr. D.S.Martin from 1908-17. The developments of X- ray crystallographic methods, be- ginning with the Bragg's in 1912, reached Union College in 1919, when a series of special lectures in crystallography and x-rays was taught by Albert W Hull and Wheeler P. Davy As Stollernearedretirement, the need for a successor led to the hiring of Edward Staples Cousins Smith (known to students by vari- ous nicknames, e.g. alphabet Smith). Smith was in the Geology considerable pride in their depart- ment. The department structure had finally become formalized about 1920, with courses regularly I isted by department from that time to the present. During the thirties the department offered a master's degree, and the lecturer was often a graduate student working on his degree, or a recent graduate of the department. As Smith neared retirement, a new assistant professor was hired in 1957. Philip Hewitt took over the department in 1960, and Leo Hall was hin~d as a second full time geologist in 1961, expanding the department to two regular faculty members for the first time. Throughmuchofthe 1960'sthese two gradually increased the offer- ings in geology. The increased interest in geology coupled with generally increasing enrollments in higher education at that time, encouraged Hewitt and Hall to ask for a further increase in the fac- ulty in the department. This was bolstered by the report of an ex- ternal examining committee chaired by John Moss, a member of the geology department at Franklin and Marshall College. On the basis of the small number of geology majors (averaging five of the decade from '55-'65), and declining enrollments in introduc- remaining geology majors through an arrangement with RPI until 1971. The Geology department was allowed to \run down\ as the rna- jors departed and no new majors were added to the program. With the demise of the Geology major, there remained an interest in hav- ing geology courses taught as part of the general education of Union students, but no invest- ment in a full-fledged department was considered. In 1971, Herman Zimmerman, a marine geologist, was hired to teach introductory level courses in geology and oceanography. For the next 13 years his success was measured, in part, by the number of students who left Union to seek a major in geology at other institutions. Zimmerman was officially a part of the department of c.ivil engi- neering. The \geology depatt- ment\ was moved into the 'Second floor ofButterfield Hall when the Civil Engineering department was moved into the first and third floors, following the construction ofthe Science and Engineering complex. During the late '70's· and early '80's an effort was made to re- establish a geology department and major at the college. This ef- fort was led by Frank Gtiggs, the chairman of the Civil Gngineering department. A group of geology alumni also discussed the possi- bility ·Of arestart of geology. This movement started through the singular contribution of John S. Wold, a geology major of the class of 1938. Wold conferred a sub- stantial endowment upon the col- lege with the understanding that it be used for a chair in geology and for re-establishment of age- ologyd·epartmentat the c0llege. Although, one might assume that this backing would result in a rapid renewal of geology, this was not the case. The College, during deliberations concerning the possibility of restarting geol- ogy, requested advice from an ex- ternal committee. The committee recommendations, perhaps on the basis of their mtderstanding of what the college considered pos- sible for geology, madewhat can be best described as \minimal\ recommendations. Since the administration was concerned (and so stated) that the new department should be a qual- ity addition to Union, the new de- partment was placed in a resource squeeze, especially regarding space. The geology department was officially re-established in 1985, in conjunction with hiring a new as- sistant professor, Kurt Hollocher. The new department was allo- cated three full time faculty lines and Hollocher was the second, joiningZimmennan, who chaired the new department. The depart- ment began the process ofhiring a third faculty member, but the process was interrupted by Zimmerman's announcement of his intention to resign to take a position with the National Science. Foundation. A decision was made to hire a visiting assistant professor to temporarily fill the third position while a search was begun for a new department chair. Paul Rybergjoined the department in the fall of 1986 as a visiting pro.- fessor and the search for a new chair proceeded. The search took two years and ended with the ap- pointment of George Sha~ as the John and Jane Wold Professor of Geology and chair of the geology department in the fall of 1 988. During the 1988-9 academic year the department hired John Garver as the permanent third faculty member, completing the comple- ment of faculty envisioned for the rebirth of geology at Union. Also during that interval the department added more than a quarter of a million dollars in new equipment to start it on a path to being one of the best equipped undergradu- ate geology departments in the country. In addition, the first batch of new geology majors be- gan a trend of increasing numbers of majors. In the academic year 1994-5, an aciditional faculty metn- b~r,Donald Rodbell, was hired to thegeology department increas- ing the faculty to four. Additional courses were added to the curricu- lum, and the number of geology majors is around 20. Indeed, this history must end just at the point where the geology department begins its new I ife in earnest, per- haps to achieve the promise first envisioned by Charles Prosser.

Science & Engineering The Concordiensis · February 24, 1995 · Page B23 A Look Back at One-Hund_red Years of Electrical Engin·eering tit Union by Kenny Lee Cottcordiensis Staff This year, along with the Col- lege celebrating its bicentennial, another important birthday is oc- curring. This year, the Electrical Engineering departmenttums one hundred. The program in Electrical Engi- neering began in 1895. Union's innovative curriculum then granted an A.B. in science and had existed since 1825, a curricula in Civil Engineering had e){isted since 1845, thus, a curriculum in Electrical Engineering found its way to Union very early on. The first curriculum in Electri- cal Engineering in the country was at the Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology. However, what caused Electrical Engineer- ing and Union to come together was the relocation of Charles P. Steinmetz and Ernst J. Berg to Schenectady as part of a move made by General Electric in 1894. This Jed to the first courses in Elec- trical Engineering to be offered at Union in 1895. It took two years for Union to hire its first Professor ofElectrical Engineering, Dr. Byron B. Brackett. A year later, Union graduated its first Electrical Engi- neers (seven). However, the early years of the department were filled with ups and downs. That is until President Raymond and the world famous Charles Steinmetz set up an Electrical Engineering Depart- ment at Union, in 1902, with Steinmetz as chair. Steinmetz headed the department for ten . years and in 1910 he started a three year graduate course, which Jed to a Doctor of Philosophy. The man who came to Schenectady with Steinmetz, Ernst J. Berg, took over as head of the Electrical Engineering De- partment after Steinmetz was re- lieved of his teaching duties in 1913. Berg served as chairman of the department for twenty-eight years, until he retired and later died in 1941. While serving as the chairman, Berg was also named as the first Dean of Engi- neering in 1931. In the time since Berg retired many other faculty have served as·departrnent chair, of them were not mentioned in more detail. The three longest serving professors, mentioned above, are much deserving an elaboration of their lives~ espe- cially at Union. Richard R. Russ served as a professor of Electrical Engineering on two separate oc- gineering from 1947 until 1981, a · total of 34 years. Along with his tremendous popularity with the students during his tenure at Union, Goodheart was also instru- mental in setting up the five year, two-degree program in engineer- ing. but other dedicated falcuty veter- casions, totaling thirty-six years.

In the early years of Electrical Engineer- ing, students studied the work- ings of alternating currents, as developed by Charles Steinmetz in 1897. Today, Electrical Engineering students can be seen working on a wide variety of projects, some include collabration work with Computer Science majors. They can be seen working on optical tracking devices and automated defibrillators. The integration of many discipliues with engineering has allowed for a great diversity in the department This has oc- curred due to Union's status as a 'Liberal Arts and Engineering Col- lege and is best seen in its ever evolving curriculum. Throughout its history, Union has prided itscl f on its innovative and cvol ving curricula. As the field of Electrical Engmeering changed over the past I 00 years, so has the curriculum. Along with these internal changes, the school has caused changes in the cur- riculum over the past I 00 years. When the department was started, Union was on a trimester system of 13, 12, and I l weeks. In 1916, Union changed to a semester sys- tem, and back to a new trimester system in 1966 (the present sys- tem). The 1966 changes greatly affected the Electrical Engineering curriculum. As a traditional liberal arts school, Union has always tried to incorporate this ideal on its engi- neers. The problem has been the growing number of required courses that the engineers have to take. Originally, the engineer- ing students took a wide variety of courses, which were greatly influenced by Charles Steinmetz's love ofleaming. However, the in- corporation of computers into the curriculum in 1959 was a major change for all future Electrical Engineers. For many years, engi- neers were graduating from Union, a liberal arts school, with only two liberal arts courses. This has slowly and with much resistance changed in the past few years, and now the accreditation board con- siders the present curriculum to be excellent The curriculum seems to be re- verting back to the idea that good engineers need to be well- rounded students and that is best achieved at schools where liberal arts and engineering are taught in the same environment The rich history of the Electri- cal Engineering Department is one of the major parts ofUnion 's great history and now that it is entering its second century, the department is gaining a renewed strength. From its beginnings with Charles Steinmetz and Ernst Berg, to the present faculty Michael Rudko and David Hannay, the department has seen a great deal of change. With its new faculty, the Electrical Engi- neering department is poised to play a major part in Union's third centuty of incorporating liberal arts and engineering into one cur- riculum.

He also discovered a small collection of heirlooms that included an hour-glass, which Romeny used to time his sennons, a pair of gold cuff links, two sets of silver spoons which the young minister bestowed upon his wife, Elizabeth Brodhead, on their wedding day in Ulster County, New York, ·in 1767 and an ivory- headed cane which was willed to the Reverend Doctor's son, Rev.

A three story brick and stone building was erected where young men could study and lodge. (The P..,arking lot to the former Van Dyke restaurant is currently in occupation of the site were this proud building formerly stood.) Again, in 1792, the Academy sent a petition to the state legislature in order to request a grant for college status.

UniOn prides itself onbe- ing able to provide money to people who would not nonnally be able to attend an institution of higher learning . Union College has a long tradition in that area, and the remaining money went to increase this fund for the f'mancial. aid to needy students. Legislative action allowed the institutions who benefited from the lotteries to have managing in- terest. Dr. Nott, with the support from the trustees, bought out the interests of otherst and then the trustees appointed him manager. As manager he was entitled to two and a quarter percent ofgross re- ceipts .of the drawing pool. The money became known as the President's Fund. Dr. Nott con-· tracted the management of the lot- tery to Mr. YatesandMr.Mcintyre, which provided that the College treasurer would be paid the sum of $276,090 in ten annual install- ments of $39,312, which they would get a rebate on interest if Yates and Mcintyre paid in ad- vance. In 1825, Yates and Mcintyre were in control of numerous lot- teries, and in the American tradi- tion, they speculated heavily. · They relied on Nott to bail them out, to keep paying the payments on the drawings, and to prevent Union from losing. The trustees did not know that Dr. Nott pledged the property of the college in re- turn for a loan of$100,000 dollars from William James, amadlantof Albany. He fwtherammged a loan of$40,000 :from a Mr. Oakley. The collateral he furnished was bonds that he and his wife held. People believe that these stocks were bought from the President' sFund. From 1826 untill834, Yates and Mcintyre were ruidng aidofUnian College. U Mcintyre and Yates failed, Union College would have to pay its creditors; Mr. James and Oakley, with serious losses. The trustees bad given Dr. Nott authority to in-vest at his discre· tion.

On January 3, 1854, he was exonerated, even though the out- look can be misconstrued to show apparent guilt. Three weeks later he drew up a trust deed to the college trustees, and turned over the money in the Presidents' F~ which became known as the Nott Trost Fund. No one can question Dr. Notes altruistic motives of building a schoolin pursuit of quality higher education. However, the manag- ing of this lottery by subcontract- ing it out was a costly endeavor, which could have jeopardized the foundation that he was trying to build.

Philip Schuyler: The Next Step for Young Union by Caroline Paine News Editor WithoutMajorGeneral Philip Schuyler, Union College would not exist today. or a least not in its current form as a chartered college. Union would have remained the prepamtory academy that Rev. Dirck Romeyn established in 1785. Rev. Romeyn solicited the New York Board ofRegents to obtain a charter for his academy for many years, but failed. Several other towns were attempting to obtain collegiate charters at the same time. As a result, the Board was setting very high standards. In order to heighten the Academy's creditability, Romeyn enlisted the help of the prestigious Major General Schuyler to accomplish his goal. Schuyler was the perfect·choice to ignite the interest of the Board of Regents. He was a local Albany resident who had distinguished himself in the military as well as in the political arena. Schuyler defmedhimself as a great war hero in the Seven Year's war, as well as the American Revolution and several Indian massacres. At the conclusion of the Battle of Bunker Hill, he was chosen as one of only . four major generals to serve in the Continental Anny. Schuyler came from one of the wealthiest and most influential families in the colonies. From 1768 through 1775 he served as a tCP.tesentative for Albany in the New Yorlc Assembly and was a delegate in the Second Continental Congress. He had connections and influence with almost every man of importance in the young United States. When Schuyler took on Romeyn' s campaign for a charter another long struggle ensued. Yet this time, the charter was fmally won. Schuyler's hearty interest iii the new college is evident through a letter he wrote to Romeyn upon the news that the charter had been granted. \Friday the seal of the University was aftlxed hereto, with the Chancellor's signature, -an event the more satisfactory to ·me as Ihavelong since wished to see the vicinity of my native place honored with such an institution, and I sincerely congratulate my fellow- citizens of Schenectady ... on the facility with which they will be able to obtain a collegiate education for their children.\ The Major General not only bestowed the College with his prestige and energies, but he also donated more money than anyone else during the College's nascent years. His continued connections with Union brought legislative grants to the school. These grants proved to be another important factor for the College's early fmancial needs. Without the heJp of Major Gmcml Philip Schuyl« Union College, perhaps, would have never earned its place as the tli'St college chartered by the BoardofRcgents in New York State. It is because of his help and dedication that be has earned the honor of sharing Rev. Romeyn's places as a founding father of Union College. The Concor.diensis • February 24, 1995 • Page BlS

They came to Union to receive academic in- struction along with the required military training. by Liza Dekoven Associate News Editor Although Worlq War II was primarily. fought in Europe, Union Coll~ge battled its own war in Schenectady, New York. By the time America declared war, enroll- ment into Union dropped to as low 150. Dr. Dixon Ryari Fox, Union College's president · at the time, was desperate to keep the college fiscally secure. He attempted to set up Army V -5 and V -7 units on campus, however, the young men were being called overseas at a pace faster than they could be enrolled into college. Washington was desperate to acquire government use of College facilities for the national service and Fox decided that byes~ tablishing a Navy V-12 unit on campus he would be able to keep the boys in college for a longer period oftiiJ.le. On July 1, 1943, 500 men were enrolled into Union College with the help of Dr. Fox and Commander Maurice L. Homer, to receive academic instruction in an area of their choice and to receive training required by the mili- tary for commissions in the Navy. Upon the addition of the V -12 units to 'Union, the campus was utilized to the fullest capacity. Fraternity houses weretransfonned Into dorms commonly referred to as SHIPS and the Kappa Alpha Lodge was turned into a sick bay with a resident physician and nurse. American Locomotives rented the space be- low the terrace wall, where West College cur- rently stands, to store the Army tanks that the company was building in Schenectady. The garden behind Hale House was tented to serve as a mess hall for the V -12 units. Union College was acknowledged for the assistance it gave the National Services in a· radio commercial for Coca-Cola in March of 1944. 11 This 150 year old institution had al- ready served in five major conflicts, and it is now doing a tremendous job in preparing. American youth for modem warfare.\ Union College professor and graduate of Union, Joseph Finkelstein, remembers vividly the college during the War. \We went to school around the clock,\ said Finkelstein. \I graduated in the fall of 1945 after a little over two years, and came back to teach in the spring of 1946 at nineteen years old.\ \When I came to teach I was barely a day ahead of the students,\ said Finkelstein. \They were terribly nice to me and some remain per- manent friends fifty years later. II According to Finkelstein, students had extremely close relationships with the faculty during the War. \I was always invited up to have dinner with professors and I remember playing tennis with the head of the history department,\ said Finkelstein, II The undergraduate program emptied out quickly. A lot had left and I re- member more would continue to go.\ According to Finkelstein, the Navy students failed out and got shipped out. \Some got into trouble,\ said Finkelstein, \I remember one got a woman in Scotia pregnant, they shipped him out. There was not much of a social life during the War. But, I remember being an RA in North College and unsuccessfully trying to quiet down some drunk young men on a Sat- urday night.\ Finkelstein remembers the former Washburn Hall which contained the Scuttle Butt, \the fabulous ice cream and sandwich shop, the College hangout during the War. There was a Coke machine that sold soda for a nickel a piece and the bookstore sold candy.\ During the War, a truncated Concordiensis was printed and a small publication was sent to the Dutchmen overseas. \As the veterans started to return from the war, frats started to come back and things be- gan to return to nonnal,\ said Finkelstein, \But hazing and Freshman beanies would have to wait for the next generation because the returning men were weathered and tired.\ ms -- l 1 1 dre, cult _ in 1 the for ( Jun of: fes fro Ha an< Ya the se1 Br' Ne an ba1 bo raJ m w

At the organization of Union College in 1795, he was called to be its first presi- dent, and continued in that office tor tour years, when he re- signed the presi- dency to return to his former charge in Philadelphia. He then scarcely re- sumed the work of the pastorate when he died, August 22, 1799. .. ,,,•'·'.,• The second president of Union College was Jonathan Edwards, the second son of the great New England divine ofthesamename. He was born in Northampton, M.A., May 26, 1745, entered Princeton College in 1761, and graduated in 1765. Soon after leaving col- lege he began the study of theology, and in October, 1766, was licensed to preach. In 1767, he was appointed tutor in his alma mater, which office he held for two years. He then became pastor at White Haven, C.T., where he remained for more than twenty-six years, until May 19, 1795. In 17Qfl, he hecame pastor oft he church at Cokhrook, C T Here l1e preached for three years, until in May, 1799, he was elected president of Union College. He assumed the duties ofthat office in July of the same year, but had only had opportunity to show his fit- ness for the position when a fever brought on his death, on the first day of August, 1801. The published writings of Dr. Edwards show the vigor of his intellect and the sina cerity of his Christian faith. He was a might antagonist of all those who seemed to him to pervert the faith once delivered to the saints, but his heart was_ tender to the poor and the . had par- taken of · the com- munion ' . the spec- tacle ex- cited a gri,ef that moved him . to teats. Presi- d e n t Edwards was buried m the church- yard ofthe First Pres- byterian church of ScllerledOOy. The Rev. Jon a than Maxcy, D.O., was born in Attleborough, M.A., Sep- tember 2, 1768. At an early age he gave evi- dence of unusual intellectual gifts, which de- termined his parents to educate him for one of the learned professions. He entered Rhode Island College, now Brown University, in 1783, and graduated, with highest honors, in 1787. During his college course he won distinction as a scholar, and for his I iterary and oratorical abil- ity. Immedi- ately after his graduation he was appointed a tutor in the college, in which position he remained for four years. In 1790, he was licensed to preach by the First Bap- tist church of Providence, R.I., and in the foil ewing year becam~ its pastor. On the day of his ordination he was appointed professor of divinity .in Rhode Island College, and at the same time, was elected a member of the board oftrustees. In 1792, he became presi- dent of the College, when he resigned his pastorate. For ten years he filled the presi- dential chair with increasing reputation as a scholar and a preacher, and, in 1802, he be- came president of Union College. President Maxcy's health was always deli- cate, and in the desire of finding a more con- genial climate, he resigned the presidency of Union College in 1804, to become the first president of South Carolina College, in Co- lumbia, S.C., where he remained until his death, June 4, 1820. Dr. Eliphalet Nott (please see pullout on the next page) Dr. Hickok was born in Danbury, C.T., De- cember 29, 1798. He was a classmate at Union College, of William H. Seward and Tayler Lewis, graduating in 1820. In 1822, he was licensed to preach, and in the next fourteen years was pastor, successively, at Newtown, Kent, and Litchfield, C.T. In 1836, he left the. pastorate to accept the pro- fessorship of theology in Western Reserve College, O.H., and, in 1844, he became pro- fessor in Auburn TheolQgical Seminary. In 1852, he was elected vice- president and professor of men- tal and :moral sci- ence in Union College; in 1861, he was made act- ing president, and on the death ofPresident Nott, in 1866,. Dr. Hickok became his successor. He was not, however, fond of the work of ad- ministration; unlike his predecessor, he pre• ferred the study of man to the management of men, and so, after a presidency of two years, he resigned his office, and retired to Amherst, M.A., where he lived the quiet life of a student and author until his death, May 7, 1888. Dr. Hickok was one of the greatest of American philosophers~ by his published writings, which are many, and by his work as a teacher, he has profoundly influenced many of our greatest thinkers. Union Col- lege has always been proud of him, but pride in his intellectual gifts has been equaied by the respect and esteem tha~ he won by his uncompromising adherence to the right un- der aH circumstances, and by the simplicity and purity of his Christian faith and charac- ter. Dr. Aiken was born in Manchester, V.T., October 30, 1827. In 1846, he graduated from Dartmouth College, at the head of his class, and at once devoted himself to teach- ing; for one year, in the Lawrence Academy at Groton, M.A., and then for tw~ years, in Philips Academy, Andover, M.A. In 1849, he began his theological studies at the Andover Theo- logical Semi- nary, and af- ter a year there, he went to Ger- many and continued his studies for two years at Halle, Leipzig and Berlin. Return- ing to Andover, he graduated there in 1853, but remained in the seminary for another year as a graduate student. ln October 1854, he was ordained and entered upon his only pas- torate, at Yarmouth, M.E., where he remained for five years. Dr. Aiken was a faithful and successful pastor, but his special gifts and training had prepared him for the I ife of the scholar and teacher, and so when, in 1859, he received from his alma mater an invitation to the chair ofLatin language and literature, he accepted the offer. This position he held until 1886, when he accepted a call to the same profes- sorship in Princeton College, where he reo mained three years. In 1869, he became president ofUnion Col- lege, and continued in that office for two years. In 1871, he was invited to the chair of Christian ethics and apologetics in Princeton Continued on page B30 1 \ ( t ( J ' l 2 f l 1 l t t I t t

The Presidents The Concordiensis ·February 24, 1995 ·Page B29 Eliphalet Nott: The Greatest College President Alex Shapiro Living Editor The venerable Dr. Eliphalet Nott was born in Ashford, Windham County, Connecticut, three years before the Declarationofinder.en.- dence,June25th, 1773. The unfortunate passing of his parents left him an orphan at a very early age. He was brought up to back-breaking farm labor; and the lessons he learned in the fields about the virtue of hard work were to stay with him throughout his life. The respon- sibilities ofthe fann also hindered his ability to attend formal school. Dr. Nott's natural thirst for knowl- edge and perceptivity drove him as a young man to read classic literature by candlelight, delight- ing in the pursuit of truth. Working in the fields one day, he saw a doctor's wagon roll by. Knowing his ambitions were more aggressive than agricultural labor, he dropped his hoe and chased the wagon down the earthen path that was to become his future. Long philosophical conversa- tions with the doctor led the young Eliphalet into the world of medicine. According to legend, however, preparations for the medical profession wentawryaf- ter he was discouraged by the sight of a severe surgical opera- tion. He then refocused his promethean energies into an in- tensestudy of the Holy Bible. The rigor of his religious leanings,. combined with his natural under- standing of temperance suited the profession favorably. His cha- risma and honest manner re- ceived recognition in 1795 when he became a I icensed Congrega- tional minister. He married his childhood sweet- heart, Sally Maria Benedict, on the fourth ofJuly, 1796, and wended his way into the Mohawk Valley to accept a pastorate in the fron- tier settlement of Cherry Valley. Word of his dynamic and im- pressive sermons on death, judgement, eternity, the straight gate, the narrow way, the Christian war, the victor's crown, the day of grace, eternal life, the resur- rection hour, the open- ing graves, and the dead small and great standing be- fore God began to spread. His. seem- ingly ·immortal vigor in the pulpit drew crowds; his \moral suasion\ en- abled the hard work- ~, · ing pioneers to con- duct t~hemselves with 'T ·, · · dignity and righteousness. The loss ofhis wife, Sally, in 1804 weighed heavily upon his mind ashe moved from Cherry Valley to Albany to become the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Albany. Sally had been worn down by the demanding pioneer lifestyle ofCherry Valley. Her memory was kept alive by a sewing thimble Nott kept in his jewel box until his death. In Albany, he gained national attention for an eloquent sermon occasioned by the death, in a duel, of his friend and parishioner Alexander Hamilton. The sermon showcased his predominant con- cern with practical morality, accus- ing the entire population of the United States of being moral ac- complices in the murder through their tacit acceptance of dueling. It was during that same year he was chosen as the fourth· Presi- dent of Union College. He kept this title for sixty-two years, the longest presidential term in the history of American colleges. An educational pioneer of su- preme optimism, Eliphalet Nott created a Union College that changed boys to \young gentle- men.\ A strong believer in salva- tion through education, he ac- cepted many students to Union who had been expelled from other institutionsfor infractions of regu- lations- so many that the college's detractors called it \Botany Bay,\ after the Australian penal colony. As President, he lived with his students in the dormitories. His leCtures on temperance, tolerance, and solid opposition to the recre- ational use of alcohol were more than just words. -Nott took per- sonal responsibility for making sure. every student who attended Union College would graduate an outstanding citizen of the United States of America. Wayward boys were dealt with each in their own way. Some were lectured and brought to see \the light,\ others were sent home until they could demonstrate a change in attitude. In his sixty-two years, Nott gradu- ated approximately four thousand students. Former President. George Alexander gave Dr. Nott the distinguished title of \A mender of boys.\ He was author of several books that emphasized his fervent belief in moral authority: Counselsto Young Men on the For- mation of Char- acter, and the Principles Which Lead to Success · and Happiness in Life, Lectures on Temperance, and First Lessons in En- glish Composition; ora Help to Young Writ- ers. A delightful anecdote il- l~:~minating his temperance when faced with disciplinary situations is retold in Perseverance Con- quers Much, a look into the final decade of Nott's leadership of Union organized by \Friends of the Union College Library,\ \One night at the beginning of the 1850's the clapper was removed from the bell atop South College and left on the President's door- step - a rather obvious challenge which Nott accepted in his own way. There was no college law against taking the clapper, he said the next afternoon in chapel, and such an act denoted a daring spirit (which he clearly admired). Still, he didn't think it was a good idea to do such things at night - too dangerous to climb around on the roof in the dark -he'd rather it were done in daylight. He recalled two former students who had stolen the clapper. They were now great men, but he didn't think the clap- per mischief was one .of their t t , grea ac s ... Dr. Nott's conceptsoftolerance and his faith in a perfectible world did not stop at the College gates. He is also regarded as the first president of the underground rail- way; giving his time and his means to help escaped slaves into Canada. His own servant, Moses Viney, was treated with the utmost respect and dignity; Nott consid- ered him among his best friends. Nott wrote to his brother in 1805, \Perhaps no college has ever fur- nished such complete security to the manners and morals of youth.\ I iis strict rules on the tres- passing rights of locals not in- volved with the school created a safe haven for its students. He purchased the campus in 1812 and hired a French landscape artist, Jacques Ramee, to draw up a plan for the grounds and build- ings. This was financed by a mas- terful lottery project. The neo- classical design is still consulted before new buildings are con- structed. Nott changed the course of American education by introduc- ing classes on American history and government, French as a modern language, and most radi- cally, the sciences. Hehimselfwas the inventor of about thirty pat- ented devices, including the Nott Stove. The Nott Stove enabled the efficient use of anthracite coal, and was a widespread success. On January 29, 1866, the edu- cator, minister, inventor, refonner, financier, peacemaker Dr. Eliphalet Nottpassedaway. Hismortalves- sel is buried in ~he Union College Burial Plot in Vale Cemetery in Schenectady, New York.

Page B30 · February 24, 1995 · The Concordieqsis continued from page B28 Theological Seminary, and resigned the presidency of the college to accept a more congenial work. He remained at Princeton, winning great distinction as a scholar and teacher, until his death, Janu- ary 14, 1892. Dr. Aiken's published writings were nu- merous, and he was honored by being cho- sen to many positions of trust in the Pres- byterian church. He was also a member of the American committee on revision of the translation ofthe Old Testament. It might almost be said that Dr. Potter became presiqent of Union College by in- heritance. He was the grandson of Dr. Nott, his mother being the only daughter of the famous president. His father was Dr. Alonzo Potter, a graduate and for some years vice-presidentofUnion College, and afterwards Episcopal bishop of Pennsyl- vama. President Potter was a Union College man by birth as well as .. by ancestry, for he was born on College Hill, September 20, 1836. He graduated from Union College in 1861, and immediately entered the Ber- keley Divinity School at Middletown, C.T., where he graduated, one year later. He became rector ofthe Church of the Nativity in South Bethlehem, P.A., in 1862, and remained in charge of that church for seven years. While still en- gaged in the work of the church, he was made, in I 866, secretary of the board of trustees and the first professor of ethics in the newly-founded Lehigh University. In 1869, he became associate rector of St. Paul's Church, Troy, N.Y., and was called from that church to the presidency of Union College. He was elected president in June, 1871, and entered upon his du~ ties at the beginning of the next college year; his inauguration took place June 26, 1872. Dr. Potter's administration was marked by a great increase in the number of stu- dents, and was made memorable by the formation of Union University, in 1873, and by the erection ofthe Nott Memorial Hall and the Powers-Washburn Building, to carry out the old plans for college build- ings, approved by Dr. Nott. In J 884, President Potter was elected Episcopal bishop ofNebraska, but declined the office. He was also elected president of Hobart College, and resigned the presi- dency of Union College in order to accept the call to that position, which he has filled to the present time. The eighth president of Union College was Professor Harrison E. Webster. He was born in Clayville, Oneida Co., N.Y., in September, 1841, and entered the sophomore class at Union College in 1859. On the breaking out of the war he enlisted as a private andserved for nearly four years in the Union army. After the close of the war he resumed his college course and graduated at the head of his class in 1868. Immediately on his graduation he was chosen by the trustees of the college to take charge of the department of natural his- tory. In further preparation for this work, he took a special course in the medical col- lege of the New York University, and in 1869, he began his work of teaching at Union College. He was an untiring in- vestigator and an inspiring teacher, and under his charge the department of natu- ral history at Union College attained to a very high degree of excellence. The col- lection of marine specimens at the college, made during vacations by Professor Webster and his summer students, is, at this day, one of the best in the country. In 1883, ProfessorWebsterlefthisalma mater and became professor of natural his- tory at Rochester University. In May, 1888, he was elected president of Union College and was inaugurated on the twenty-sixth day of the following month of June. New prosperity came, and all hoped for many years of progress under President Webster's leadership, but soon he found himself unequal to the burden of care and responsibility he had assured. In January, 1893, he offered his resignation,. which the trustees reluctantly accepted a year later. Dr. Andrew V. Raymond, the ninth president ofUnion College, was born Au- gust 8, 1854, in Visscher's Ferry, Saratoga county, N.Y. His father was a minis- ter of the Re- formed Church and a graduate of Yale College . in the class of 1825. Our president was prepared for college the Troy High School and by a private tutor, entered the sophomore class at Union College in 1872, and graduated in 1875. He then entered the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, graduating in 1878. He was ordained in June of that year, and became pastor of the First Reformed Church of Patterson, N.J. He was called to the Trinity Reformed Church of Plainfield, N.J., January 20, 1881, where he remained until he became pastor of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Albany, N.Y., in February, 1887. In January, 1894, he was elected presi- dent of Union College; after some weeks ofhesitation, due to reluctance to leave the church he was serving, he accepted and was inaugurated June 26, 1894. Dr. Raymond died in 1 918. Charles Alexander Richmond, the tenth president of Union College, was born in New York City, January 7, 1863, of Scotch parentage. He attended Orange Military Academy, the College of the City ofN~w York, and received his B.A. degree from Princeton in 1883, an M.A. degree in 1886 and graduated from the Princeton Theo- logical Seminary in 1888. After his ordi~ nation in 1888, he. became pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, East Aurora, N.Y., and six years later transferred to the Madison A venue Church of Albany. In 1 909, he became president ofthe College. D r Riehm ond 's presidency was a period of greftt impor- . tance to Union College. After a long period of depression and d isco.u r.age- ment, the Col- lege began to prosper mark- edly under Dr. Richmond, also known to thousands of alumni as \Prexy. During his adminis .. tration, a number of buildings were erected, among others, the Alumni Gym- nasium, the Butterfield Chemical Labo· ratory, and The Memorial Chapel; the fac- ulty increased from twenty-seven to eighty; the student body increased from 139 to 800; and the endowment increased from $628,000 to nearly $4,000;000. Dr. Richmond died at his home in Wash- ington, D.C., July 12, 1940, after an ill- ness of more than two years. He had served as Head of the College for about twenty years. Dr. Frank Parker Day was born in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia, May 9, 1881. In 1903, he graduated from Mount Allison University with honors in philosophy. In 1905, he was elected a Rhodes Scholar from New Brunswick, Canada. He gradu- ated from Oxford with honors in English, and then, in 1908, he attended the Univer- sity ofBerlin. After returning from abroad, Dr. Day married and became a professor of English at the University of New Brunswick. From 1912 to 1914 he was head of the English Department at the Camigie Institute ofTechno1ogy. During his tenure at Carnigie, however, the First World War broke out, and Dr. Day enlisted as a second lieutenant in the King's Colonial Imperial Yeomanry, and was promoted to colonel at the Battle of Amiens. HeretumedtoAmericain 1919. From 1919 to 1926 he was Director of Academic Studies at Carnigie, and from 1926 to 1928 he was professor of English at Swarthmore. In 1929, he was inaugu- rated as President of the College. Ill health caused by war wounds com- pelled Dr. Day to submit his resignation in 1 933. Although his stay was a mere four-and-a-halfyears,Dr. Day had accom- plished much. He, among others; inte,. grated the academic departments in four divisions, introduced hon~rs courses and Presidents established the alu~ni scholarships. Dr. Day was also the author of several books and articl'es. Maybe his most fa- mous, \Autobiography of a Fisherman,\ is about the art of fishing. The twelfth president of Union College, Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, wasbom inPostdam, N.Y., Dec. 1, 1887. An only child, Dr. Fox had been described as a \scholarly- type boy\ who was always interested in his school work. While stHl a boy, he dem- onstrated a special ability as an orator. In 1912, he received his M.A. from Colum- bia University, and in 1917 his Ph.D. Starting as an assistant in 191 I, he was for 22 years a member of the faculty of Columbia. In 1929 and I 930 he was a visiting professor at Yale University. He was installed as president of the College on Oct 12, 1934. A prominent editor and historian, Dr. Fox specialized in American social his- tory, particularly of the early periods. Un- ,doubtedly the most famous published work that he had ever edited, the 12-vol,. ume .series entitled \A History of Am~rican Life\ was considered one of the most signifi- cantendeav- ors in Am.erican history in the last two decades before his death. Among his accomplishments as presi- dent of the college were the improvement of the college plant, the increase in fac- ulty salaries, and the adoption of a system of government work apprenticeships which gave selected students the opportl:l- nity to coordinate their studies with prac- tical experience in federal, state and civic jobs. He was also the holder of a number of degrees, and was a member and held of- fice in nearly 40 organizations. Dr. Fox died on Jan. 30~ 1945. The thirteenth president of Union Col- .lege was Dr. Carter Davidson. Born in Louisville, Kentucky, 1905,hegraduated from Harvard in 1926, and received his M.A. in the field of English and American literature from the University ofLouisville and his Ph.D. from the University of Chi- cago in 1930. He then taught English and American literature at the Universities of Idaho, Chicago, and Carleton College. In 1936, he became President of Knox Col- lege, Galesburg, Illinois. At 31, he was the youngest college president in the coun- try at that time. About ten years later, on, March 11, 1946, he was inaugurated as president of the Union. During his 18 years at the college, the college enrollment increased from 800 to 1200; the endowment rose from $6 mil- F ( li h b t4 s f ti 1 d p n

Presidents Continuedjromprevious page lion to $30 million; and a library, a field house, and four new dormitories were built. A well-known educator, he was a founder and first chairman of the Empire State Foundation ofLiberal Arts Colleges. His most famous work, a 1934 coHabora• tion with Louis Untenneyer, was entitled \Poetry; Its Appreciation and Enjoyment.\ Shortly before his death on October 20, 1965, he had resigned to become Presi- dent and Chief Executive Officer of the Association o:f American Colleges; an 850- member educationalstudy group. .,. Dr. Davidson was 60. The fourteenth presidentofUnion Col- lege was Dr. Harold C. Martin. A native · of Raymond, Pa., he graduated from Hartwick College in 1937, and received his M.A. from the University of Michi- gan and his Ph.D. in comparative litera- ture from Harvard ih 1954. W e 1 I - known m education circles as a leader in the · reform of En- glish instruc- tion, he taught at sec- ondary schools in Adams and Goshen, N.Y., before joining the Harvard faculty as a teaching fellow in 1950. Dr. Martin was director of General Education A, a por- tion of Harvard's General Education Pro- gram, before coming to Union in July 1965. The most notable change during the Martin administration was the increase in student enrollment from I ,300 to 1,900 This was in part due to the rise in the num- her of black students, and in larger part to the college's decision to extend enrollment to females. At the time ofhis resignation, more than 500 women attended the for- merly all male college. As president, Dr. Martin was very in- volved in fund~raising. The Science and · Engineering Building, a $7.5 million un- dertaking, and the expansion of Schaffer Library were results ofhis fund-raising ef- forts. ln 1974, Dr. Martin left the college and becamethe first full-time president of the American Academy in Rome. The fifteenth president of Union Cot- lege, Dr. Thomas Neville Ji3onner, was born in Rochester, N.Y., 1924. He gradu- ated from the University of Rochester in 1947 andtook his doctorate in history at Northwestern University in 1952. He served successively as Dean of William Woods College in Missouri, 1951-54; FulbrightLecturer in American Civiliza- tion at the University ofMainz,Germany, 1954-55; and Professor of History and Head of the Social Sciences division at the University of Nebraska, 1955-62. From 1963 to 1968 he wa~ professor of History and chairman of the Department of His- tory at the University of Cincinnati. He was also president of the University ofNew Hampshire, before being inaugurated as presi~ent of the College on October 5, 1974. On the one hand, the four years of the Bonner administration were characterized by advancement. Under Bonner, the six- year Medical Education Program was implemented and the applicant pool as well as the endowment increased by more than 20 percent. In addition, programs such as \Project 80,'' a campus beautifi- cation plan, and the Washington Irving Lectures were realized. However, on the other hand, the Bonner era was marred by turmoil. Doubts and controversies concerning Dr. Bonner, which stemmed from athletics to academ- ics to personality conflicts, eventually led to two separate overwhelming votes of no confidence in him. The turmoil reached its zenith during the last 14 months of the Bonner Administration. Scandals con- cerning the head hockey coach as well as The Concordiensis · February 24, 1995 · Page 831 the Admissions Office and its Director sur- faced, followed by the departure of much ofthe Administration. Dr. Bonner finally submitted his resig- nation on May 16, 1978. Shortly thereaf~ ter, he assumed the Presidency ofWayne State University, Detroit, MI. The sixteenth president of Union Col- lege, John Selwyn Morris, was born in Wales, 1926. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1950 from the University College of South Wales and Monmouthsire at Cardiff in philosophy, education, greek and he- brew. In 1953, he was granted a second bachelor's degree from the University of Cam- bridge, and earned a master's degree there in 1957. He earned another master's degree in 1957 in philosophy from Colgate University in phi- losophy, and his Ph.D. from Columbia University in religion in 1961. From 1954 to 1957 he served as an ordained minister with the Vernon and Vernon Center, Oneida County, Presbyterian churches while pursuing graduate work at Colgate. Later, Morris joined the Colgate faculty, first as a full-time instructor in philosophy and religion, and later, in 1970, as a pro- fessor. He had been for about six years provost and dean of faculty there before coming to Union College in August, 1979. After rocky times in the late 1970's, Morris was credited with restoring stabil- ity at the College. He was also well-known for bolstering the endowment, which in- creased from $30 million to $90 million. During Morris' tenure, a number of changes and additions to the academic programs and buildings had been made. Among them were a $6 million expansion of the College Center and Alumni Gym- nasium; and the creation of a geology de- partment. Also, an educational studies program which trained students to teach at the secondary level and programs in Asian and women's studies were estab- lished. In August, 1990, Morris stepped down, handing over the reins to a new president who would lead the College into the fu- ture. This new and current president is Dr. Roger H. Hull. Born in New York City, he and his family moved to Scarsdale, WestchesterCounty, when he was 13. He rece.ived his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College, a law degree from Yale Law School, and his master's and doctorate degrees in law from the Univer- sity of Virginia. From 196 7 to 1971 he was a corporate and securities attorney for White & Chase, a New York City law firm In 1971, he worked as a special counsel to Gov. Linwood HoltonofVirginia. In 1976 he became the vice president for develop- ment and planning at Syracuse University, where he was involved in fund raising Five years later he moved to Wisconsin and became president of Beloit College, a position he held for nine years Under Hull, Beloit College redeemed itself. When he was appointed, the col- lege had been experiencing financial dif- ficulties. Faculty were cut; buildings were closed down; and enrollment declined Under Hull, however, some faculty were rehired, salaries increased by 75 percent, the college's financial aid budget tripled, and the endowment grew 400 percent to $32 million. In 1990, Dr. Hull left the helm ofBeloit College and became Union College's sev- enteenth president. One ofDr Hull's principal responsibili- ties is the overseeing of the Bicentennial campaign. Dr. Hull is also an avid jogger, opera lover, and travel enthusiast The closing year of the second century of the existence of Union College gives us faith that the brightest days are still be- fore us. Roger Hull Carries the Torch into Union's Third Century by Elizabeth DeKoven Associate News Editor President Roger Hull has been at Union since the Fall of 1990, and since then he has made many important contributions to the campus. Among them are the reno- vations on the Nott Memorial, the con- struction ofthe YulmanTheater, the fus- ing of liberal arts and engineering, and the Schenectady 2000. \When I first visited Union, I knew that it was a good institution and I had heard that it was the best kept secret in New York,\ said Hull. \I would like to think that it is now the best kept secret in the northeast.\ Upori arriving at Union College as its president, Hull's main objective has been to be consistent with the history and heri- tage of the institution. Hull felt that it was inappropriate to impose entirely new views and philosophies. \Keeping things consistent was easy for me, for things I am interested in, Union has historically done.\ \The role of a president is to insure the viability of an institution, to make sure that the finances and faculty insure the student body the best possibly education,\ said Hull. \My goal has always been to de- velop a sense of pride in the .stu- dents, faculty at1d administration and to try and insure that the institution is both in theory and in fact stronger to- morrow than today and even stronger the day after that\ Hull has had three main objec- tives for Union stu- dents since his ar- rival: to emphasize undergraduate re- search, to make the campus as interna- tional as possible· and to bring together 100 years of liberal arts and engineering. Hull has also em- phasized how important it is for students to contribute back to society through or- ganizations like Big Brothers and Big Sis- ters, tutoring programs and .We Care About U Schenectady. Hull's personal goals include the Schenectady 2000 pro- gram and the utiliza- tion of the properties on Lenox Road. \Long ago, I was taught that it important to do what is right,\ said Hull \It is also important do what you believe in, even ifpeople are criti- cal of you, and I believe that it is important not to deny the college the $500,000 that the col- lege looses each year by not using those proper- ties ... that equals part of the 2.5% tuition raise.\ In looking back at the 200 year history of Union College, Hull acknowledges that the greatest contribution to Union was Eliphalet Nott. \Nott has been the best college president that this nation has produced. He can be attributed to the ad- dition of modem languages, engineer- ing and the heart sciences to Union,\ said Hull. \Nott's only fault was that he remained president for a I ittle too long.\ As for the futureofUnion, Hull would I ike to see the College build on the tradi- tion and history of an institution with a strong student body and a first rate fac- ulty. Hull would also like to see the col- lege continue to develop the facilities of this institution and he would like to see the College continue to meet its finan- cial obligations. Most importantly, Hull hopes that II in an appropriate way Union can bring together liberal arts and engi- neering in the 20th century. II \When I came to Union I found a won- derful institution trying to arrive at a new level of excellence,\ said Hull. \Whether I have been capable of doing that- I leave to others to judge.\

Chester Arthur: The Man Behind the Myth by Carrie Wheeler Concordiensis Staff Chester A. Arthur, the 21st president of the United States, and Union alumnus from the class of 1848 has a mysterious auni around him. Who was this man who mostcan not recall when list- ing the presidents? Arthur had the reputation of being a bit of a troublemaker-while he was at Union. As the story goes, he once stole the bell from Old Chapel and dumped it in the Mohawk River and to this day still owes tuition money. This rumor remains unsubstantiated by school records. Born October 5, 1830, Chester Arthur was the youngest of five children. His father, William Arthur, an active anti-slavery ad- vocate. was a local Baptist preacher. In 1845. after successfully completing his preparatory schooling. Arthur enrolled at Union. Interestingly. the College documents Arthur, or \Old Chef\ as they used to call him. as six- teen. \\-hich .is impossible if he was born in 1830 Could it be that he lied in orderto meet with Union's strict admission policy, which tor- bid the enrollment of anyone un- der the age of 16') Or was a tamed critic ·s alleged story that Arthur S\vitched American birth records with his older brother in order to become President tme') Described as \a gentlemen with a striking personality,\ Arthur was a good student. who was well . liked by his classmates. A Phi Beta Kappa member as well as the Corresponding Secretary tor the Psi Upsilion fraternity, Arthur was interestingly known for not liking to speak in public. During his three years at Union, Arthur resided for the most part in North College and often took winters off to teach, in order to help pay for schooling. The tuition cost in 1845 was consid- ered steep at $28 dollars a year plus the additional $125 dollars needed for room and board. U n 1 o n boasted a 300 plus student body during Arthur's se- nior year and stood as one of the fore- most institu- tions in the United States under the di- rection of the famed Pre.si- dent Eliphalet Nott.

Inter- estingly, young Arthur was fined for not making it to his required prayer session. In fact, Arthur is also documented as being fined for breaking a pane of glass, and dismantling a door knob .

In 1853, Arthur moved to NYC and beganWGrk- ing at a finn were he be- came a well known anti- slavery ad- vocate_ His strong v1ews seon led him to politics. I n 1856, the young law- yer became an active member of the newly formedRe- publican pa.rty and campaigned for the party's first presidential nominee, John C. Freemont. Arthur's ac- tive participation led him high in the ranks of the party as he be- came one of the stalwarts, second only to Senator Roscoe Conkling. When the Civil War began, Arthur was rewarded for his dedi- cation to the party with an ap- pointment to the state militia where he was responsible for the supply ofvol~nteer troops orga- nized for active duty. From this moment on Arthur began his rise to presidency. One political columnist wrote, \Chester A. Artht:1r's career from college to- vice-presidency, was anything but easy. Arthur was the b~neficiary of change and good fortune, but to his credit he made the most of these opportu- nities.\ As a delegate for the Republi- can National Convention in 1880, Arthur soon found, much to his surprise, that he had been nomi- nated as the vice presidential can .. didate. After November's victory, Arthur became the 20th vice presi- dent of the United States. This victory, however, was short and sweet as President Garfield was assassinated only 10 months af- ter begin elected. A few days later, Arthur assumed the presidency. One ofh.is most worthy efforts was the refonn ofthe civil service program_ He is also praised for his effortsto rebuild the navy, his reduction of public debt by $400,000 dollars, and his ~cquisi­ tion ofPearl Harbor_ Thought by many as a man of high character and outstanding achievements, Arthur lost much support in his determination to reform the civil service program. In 1884, Arthur was denied the nomination for presidency. Unfortunately, Arthur lived only a year and 260 days after his presidential tenn ended. Suffer- ing from Bright's disease in 1886, Arthur developed a serious heart condition and died of a cerebral hemorrhage on November 16. A Union Professor, who has long since past, sums up Arthur life best remarking, \From the out- set he was a president of no fac- tion, no party but of the entire people.\ Perhaps it was Arthur's Union education that made him such a strong hearted individual and al- though he may have been forgot- ten by many, he remains both in our hearts and the nations. :- .. ;u; ·-'· ~ l:r II ,/ <fi-j':< /1~.a --~; A,#' w~( ,_...,y ~;~.~ .. ~ ;{ .hfJ /a·~',f.P'ft /. r;- f,YJ /.tl' :.J ~'If t JIC //:t I r:t_ft'/:: /~>'l' ~·<\-\f ~,\'/ t/ '1- · f,!s< il'i?r f II'<' ,,',(J 'I' . l l i : . ;l.J\/J '<)\ ,;-;; : ,;f.rt ' ,1 ./t: !/filii') i.Y?d 1 Arthur's exemplary grade repol't at Union. •,

Bullets. Blood. Shots falling fast and furious. Anxiety beading off the brow of raw recruits as their leader gazes with rage at the falling front line. ColOilel Peissner, galled by the demoralizing scene of retreating men, takes his horse to the front of his own line. Drawing an arm across this tumultuous scene, fin- ger pointed with accusation and scorn for the falling front line, he looks toward his own troops, still green with inexperience, and with a burning rage in his throat ex- claims, \See see, the vet•e-rens!\ The unmistakable Gennan ac- cent cuts the air. The trade mark of this leader; a voice which both frightens men, and inspires them. But within no more than an in- stant of this utterance, Peissner '·s short life came to an end. With the smashing of one. bullet, and then another to his head and spine, Elias Fritz Peissner, Colo~ nel, ... Patriot, ... and Union College Professor, lies mortally wounded on the ground. As his blood pools on the soil beneath him, a nearby soldier records for poster- ity, Peissner's dying· words. \God ta:ke care of my poor wife and children.\ Elias Peissner died in the battle of Chancellorsville, Virginia, on May 2, 1863. He was mourned by his wife, children, fellow officers, a11d especially those associated with Union College. Today he is one of the most colorful and he- roic men of our past. He was a true \renaissance man\- a lover, an intellect, a leader, a patriot, and a hero. In an age when America, and the media, seeks heroes out of the most unlikely places, we, the students of Union College are blessed to have a man we can re- late ourselves to. Colonel Elias Peissner, a U. C. Professor killed during the Civil War College at the time. Still, Peissner's academic record was strong. Although, he did not have a Munich degree, his stud- ies probably far exceeded the quality of an American M.A. of the day. Peissner was a tall, slender man, a head above the crowd. His ap- pearance was crowned with shoulder length brown hair that often was as wild as his passions. He was a true 'renaissance man' -a lover, an intellect, a ieader; a patriot, and a hero. Elias Peissner was a rare kind of man, even in his own age. Al- though he began teaching at Union College in 1851, his life, and the turbulence caused by his deep passions do not begin here. They predate his life in America, which began when he emigrated from Germany in 1849. Peissner was born on March 27, 1826, in a small Bavarian town about a hundred miles north of Munich. He was the second son in a family of eight children, who in his youth lead the rigorous life of a German student. At age nine he left home for good, and studied at the Gymna- sium of Amberg. As a student he. became a member of a much larger world than he had ever known at Vilseck. He graduated at age seventeen, and then continued to study phi- losophy and law at the University ofMunich. He established a repu- tation as a scholar in his day, but only a century later was it revealed through research on his life that he did not in fact graduate with an M.A., a prerequisite of Union With polished grace, and the dig- nified manners of a gentleman, Peissner possessed a personality that attracted the attention of many important people ofhis day. Intrigue grows.as one looks into his Gennan past because Peissner crosses paths with such greats as the King ofBavaria, and a contro- versial temptress of this period, Lola Montez. Lola Montez was a woman who for a period of 50 years or more captured the hearts and imagina- tions of Europeans. Born in En- gland and mised in India, Lola cre- ated a new identity as a young woman. She drew attention to herself first as a dancer,.and later used her beauty and persuasion to climb the social ranks of men in Europe. In 1846, Lola appeared in Munich. She immediately became a favorite of King Ludwig I, and over the next two years was able to use her status with the king to cement political power for herself. She \inspired frenetic loya!ty\ among her supporters, one of whom was a young student named Peissner. This same year he dropped outofthe University. A biography of Elias Peissner, by George Danton says!> \He was a romantic, freedom-loving enthu- siast, re·ared in the ideaLism of the school of Theodor Kordor!> and ready to stake everything on his fight against tyr- anny.\ He was young, brash and naive perhaps. Lola was a politi- cally wise woman, able to manipuiate men, and one wonders w h e r e Peissner stood with re- gards to this. Lola encoun- tered trouble in Munich in 1847. A por- tion of t~e public was not pleased with her ascendancy to power, or influence overmen. She · was well known for her extrava- gant parties, and \her horse-vthip- piilg of those who displeased her.\ In February, 1848, riots broke out in Munich which forced the abdication of King Ludwig I, and also forced Lola to fleeforherlife. Peissner accompanied her on her departure, and became a bit of a local legend himself. He was de- picted in local political cartoons as a man who is a prisoner of his heart. Others were even more scandalous than th.at. Peissner stayed with Lola through thick and thin, smuggling her hack to Munich at least once. But during this period, Peissner developed some deep self doubts ..• his most fulfilling books were those that used words like daggers against the enslavement of humans. He could not sit still at a time when the Union and the Confederacy were moving ever so closer to war. For Peissner, the Civil Warwa~ about human bondage and nothing else. about the situation that drove Lola from power. Legend has it that withthis unmanly sign ofweak- ness, Lola rejects Peissner, say- ing \Go coward!\ In a fit of depression from his loss ofLola, one biographer claims that Peissner came close to end- ing his own I i fe that year. Elias and his brother Franz em i- grated to the United States that year. Elias gained employment as a family tutor in Philadelphia., a po- sition which was contracted to end ln the summer of 1850 Just when life is beginning to look a little more mundane, Elias Peissner sets out on a newadven- turewhich would bring him to the gates of Union College. He, and some friends set out on a trip to Niagara in western New York, on foot! However, Elias never reached Niagara. En route to western New York, the group stopped by Schenectady to meet some other German acquaintances. While in the ~ity, Elias was introduced to a Professor Foster, al itera:ry scholar, and a draughtsman at the former locomotive works, near down- town. Foster and Peissner seemed to strike up a friendship that in- cluded the tutoring ofoneanother in their native tongues. Foster, using his position and influence with the college president Eliphalet Nott, managed· to get Peissner his first teaching assign- ment at Union - fencing and broadsword! A year later, in the winter of 1851, a position unex- pectedly opened in the language de- partment, and the col- lege hired Peissner to fill it. He taught Latin .. that term, and _the following summer picked up acourse in Po- litical Economy. In 1855, the College offi- cially recognized Peissner as a scholar, and founded for him a professorship of the German Language and Literature, and added the lectureship on political economy. Ed Cory (Union class of1863) was a student of Professor Peissner, and a \co-worker... as in such slight degree that I could be ... \ Cory left behind a descrip- tion ofPeissner that is a testament to the respect he garnished from students in his years ~t Union. \He was always alert for every sign of intelligent curiosity. How heartily he recognized every ef- fort. No cost of time and atten- tion and work was too great for him when sought sincerely,\ Cory wrote. That Peissner brought with him • r. the republican sentiments, and passions to fight tyranny where ever he encountered it is sup- ported both by Cory, and by speeches recorded in the Union College archives. The mostglar- ing tyranny of his day being sla- very in the south Cory writes, \No man ever kept more steadily burning or more se- renely bright the flame of intellec- tual conscience. He respected himself too much not to respect equally the mental independence of others It was not only toward the truths which he guided us which were of value~ of greater worth was that love of truth with which his bright example inspired us, that sincere humility, that proud integrity which he unfolded before us\ During his tenure at Union, Peissner wrote many books on the teaching of the Gennan language, but perhaps in retrospect his most fulfilling books were those that used words like daggers against the enslavement of humans. He could not sit still at a time when the Union and the Confederacy were moving ever so closer to war. For Peissner, the Civil War wa~ about human bondage and noth- ing else. Before the Literary Societies of Union College in February, 1862, Peissner gave a speech about the \coronation\ of Jefferson Davis as the first President of the Con- federate States of America on what was President Washington's birthday. \The father of the Country, to whom the nation owes more than to any other man, dead or living, could not leave this life before securing freedom for his slaves. He saw the wrong, he saw the evil and curse of slavery, and wanted to give his country, with his dy- ing breath, a last lesson.\ Peissner continued, \I wish I could read this item [President Washington's Last Will and Tes- tament] today at Richmond, be- fore Jefferson Davis and his court · of slaveholders. · I wish I could whisper it into the ears of their historical Vice-President, who calls slavery the foundation of all last- ing empire. I wish I could trumpet it today all over the land, South and North, to rouse the people from their shameful neglectful- ness, their barbarism, and unbe- coming timidity.\ And as icing on the cake, Peissner points out that \had the patriotic Southerners, who now so festively celebrate Washington's birthday, imitated his noble ex- ample, there would not now be disunion, civil war and distraction among us.\ Peissner could not stand still on this issue. He dedicated a full length book to the criticisms of the writings of one popular southerner, whose own book for- warded the practice of slavery. In Continued on B34

However, he resorts to the history of the world to show how in every case, slavery died out, and morality won the day. To say that Peissner was a popular teacher on campus would be an understatement He was elected to the Sigma-Phi rratemity by Union students, and Phi Beta Kappa by his colleagues \One of the strongest ties be- tween this professor and his stu- dents was the Zouave Company organized in the summer term of 1861 \This was a group of young students - 82 in all- who chose to study a military discipline. They elected Peissner to its captaincy unanimously, and he drilled with them every day Ed Cory writes, \For months he devoted all of his time to the study of military tactics and to the train- ing of a I ittle company of stu- dents, into which latter task he threw as much zeal and patience as ifhe had been training an army corp \I can see him now, his lithe, erect form, his tlashing eye, his commanding yet graceful ges- tures, and can hear his ringing voice as he shouted his orders to the boys scattered in the skirmish line, along the western slope of the campus yonder\ Over two-thirds of the Zouave Company obtained commissions in the Union Army, wliich truly was a testament to Peissner's skill. Yet the Zouaves were not enough for Professor Peissner. He was a man of principle and p_as~ sion. It was too easy for a man to exclaim at the top of his I ungs that he passionately believed in a' cause, only to come shortofbet- ting his life on that cause ..

Peissner left students back at Colonel Peissner's last day on Earth. On that fateful day, an over- whelming Rebel force attacked Union forces, catching them off guard. The front line broke, and soon the Confederates were pour- ing in on Peissner'srearposition.

In 1823, he sold a play entitled \Clari the Maid of Milan\ in which the famous lines of\'Home l:fome, sweet, sweet Home!\ were in. The story of the writing ofthis song has had many different ver- sions. One of the more popular ones being that it was written \in a driving storm on a scrap of pa- per under a lamp post by a tat- tered and hungry tramp\ in a for- eign land. However, the follow- ing is an account by the author on how the song was made. \'I first heard the air in Italy. One beautiful morning as I was stroll- ing alone amid some delightful scenery, my attention was ar- rested by the sweet voice of a peasant girl who was carrying a basket laden with flowers and vegetables. This plaintive air she trilled with so much sweetness and simplicity that the melody at once caught my fancy I accosted her, and, after a few moments' con- versation, I asked for the name of the song, which she could not give me, but having some slight knowledge music myself, barely enough for the purpose, I re- quested her to repeat the air, which she did, while I jotted down the notes as best I could. It was this air that suggested the words of 'Home, Sweet Home,' both of which I sent to Bishop at the time I was preparing the opera. Bishop happened to know the air well, and adapted the music to the words.\ Sixteen years earlier he had writ- ten the song \'Home Dear Home\ at Union, which did indeed play a great part in the writing of this his- torical song. In 1842, Payne'slifetookatum to politics and he was appointed United States Consul at Tunis. He was the American Consul for only a year when he was replaced be- cause of the new election of Presi- dent Polk. However, again in May 1851, he sailed again, and for the last time to Tunis. He fell ill while in Africa and after along and pain- ful sickness, surrounded by friends, he died April 9, 1852. He was buried in the Protestant cem- etery in Tunis. After thirty-one years, his remains were brought back to the United States, his home, and buried in the Oak Hill cemetery in Georgetown, District ofColurn.bia. On June 13, 1911, there was a gateway erected in the memory of John Howard Payne, known as Payne Gate. It is located at the end of Nott Street, on the south side of campus. It was erected in honor for the alumni of Union who was not only a brilliant actor and playwright, but also gave so much to his country. Use this space for advertising.

He was of English descent; his family had migrated to America in the 1700's. Seward was one of five children bo.rn to Samuel Sweezy, a prosperous doctor and businessman, and Mary Jennings Seward. Wil'liam stood five feet, six inches in height,red..:haired, blue~eyed, and slight of build. By aH accounts, he was bright, gregarious, and stubborn, with a penchant for adventure. At the age of 15, though his health was a matter of concern, Seward's father entered him in Union College. In January 1819, William left college and headed for the South with a classmate. He began teaching school in Geor- gia, only to. return to Union six months later. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1820. The young Seward studied law in various offices, earning his de• gree in 1822. The following year he became a partner in the office of Judge Elijah Miller in Auburn, New York, and on October 20, 1824, married Frances Adeline Miller, the judge's younger daughter. Seward would eventually real- ize his calling to politics when the New York Whigs made Seward their candidate for governor in 1834. Although he'd suffer de- feat at the decisive victory of his opponent, William L. Marcy, Seward would not remain long out of politics. Hispolitical careerputonhold, Seward devoted his time to a large and successful legal prac- tice. But Seward's interest in poli- tics was as keen as ever, and with the inauguration of the Van Buren Administration, panic and depression brightened the Whigs' prospects. In 1838, Seward again won the nomina- tion of the Whigs, and was elected to the highest office in the state by some 10,000 votes over his Democratic challenger, Marcy. As governor, Seward champi- oned progressive reforms in edu- cation, prison reform, and the construction of railroads and ca- nals. His abolitionist stance on slavery put him at odds with Southern governors and brought him into national prominence as a leader in the growing anti-sla- very movement. Seward was re- elected in 1840, but by only 5,000 votes. He chose not to seek a third term. A Whig majority in the New York legislature elected Seward to the U.S. Senate. There, he used his charm and charisma to win friends among both N orthem and Southern Senators. He was in- fluential with President Taylor to the point that he obtained virtu- ally complete control over federal patronage in New York. Just as the Republican Party began to evolve after the disinte- gration of the Whigs, Seward joined its ranks, supporting the Republicans' advocacy of anti- slavery measures. Seward by Marc Foster/Concordiensis Staff William Seward (1820) is one of tile most famous Union College alumni. quickly ascended to the leader- ship of the party and, by 1856, wanted the Republican presiden- tial nomination. But advice from close friends urged him to wait until another time. Reluctantly, Seward withheld his name from the ballot. Over the next years, though, Seward would outrage Republican bellicose foreign policy that in- cluded threats of war with France and Spain. Lincoln rejected these proposals. Weeks later, Confed- erates forced the surrender ofF ort Sumpter: the Civil War had begun. During the War years, Seward successfully kept European states, including England, from Powel1, a Confedemte conspirator, gained entrance to Seward's home and forced his way to the Secretary's bedside and knifed him repeatedly in the face and neck. He would recover and go on to continue as State Secretary under President Johnson. Perhaps his most lasting work as Secretary was the leaders by de- claring that he cared nothing for the party and that he was concerned only with the welfare of the nation. This, doubled with As governor, Seward championed progressive reforms in education, prison reform, and the construction of railroads and canals. His abolitionist stance on slavery put him at odds with Southern governors and brought him to national prominence as a leader in the growing anti-slavery movement. purchase of Alaska from Russia's Czar Alexander II. Seward saw the po- tential for great re- turns from the Alas- kan territory and knew its strategic im- portance, so he was eager to buy. For $7.2 million, Alaska Abraham Lincoln's growingrepu- tation as a statesman, weakened Seward's candidacy. Though bit- terly disappointed by Lincoln's · nomination, he chose to put the party's interests before his own and campaigned vigorously for the Republican ti.cket. Upon Lincoln's election, Seward was offered and gratefully accepted the Department of State in De- cember 1860. During the months between Lincoln's election to March 4, 1861, eight Southern states passed ordinances of recession. In this critical period, Seward de- voted himselfto Union-saving ef- forts. Thus, as Secretary of State, Seward's immediate objectives were two-fold: to prevent there- mainder of the border states from seceding, and to handle the Southern Confederacy in such a way that it would dissolve. To achieve these objectives, Seward suggested Union support of Fort Sumpter in South Carolina and a recognizing the Confederacy. He also championed the vigorous enforcement of the Monroe Doc- trine in Mexico and South America. Seward's diplomacy as Secretary of State also embraced other aspects of foreign affairs. One was the expansion of Ameri- can commerce. The otherwas the expansion of American territory. Seward had long been an ex- pansionist, visualizing an ever-in- creasing empire. He envisioned democratic imperialism that added to the virtues of democratic gov- ernment. Seward was convinced that restoratiqn .of the Union opened the way to this new era so he fostered immigration and promoted good relations with Latin America and was a propo- nent ofinternationalism. The assassination plot of April .14, 1865, against President Lin- coln, involved Seward as well. In- jured seriously in a carriage acci- dent days before, Se~ard was confine'i:l to his bed. Lewis was acquired by the United States in 1867. The purchase of Alaska marked the virtual close of Seward's public career. He retired to Auburn where he spent two months attending to personal business and answering letters. Restless, Seward planned an am- bitious voyage west where he toured California and Alaska. Later, he would tour the world. Seward was described as cocky and self-assured. At times, it seemed as if he were acting from political calculation, rather than sincere interest. Contemporaries thought him fascinating, often im- pressive, but altogether lacking in that great quality, humility. Nonetheless, he was a visionary who preserved the Union and ad- vanced the ideals of the nation around the world. Seward died qn October 10, 1872, at his home in Auburn, New York. Burial took place at Auburn Cemetery.

He was the Son of a Presbyterian minister and prominent abolition- ist, and was raised in Poughkeepsie, New York. Ludlow was a junior when he transferred to Union -from the Colleg~ ofNew Jersey (now know as Princeton) in April of 1855, during thethird tenn of the 1854-55 academic year. Ludlowwas not much different from yottrtypical,modem-day col- lege student, Little is known about the courses he studied other than the fact hewas enrolled in tlieclas- sics. He was no great scholar, making average grades and gradu- ating in the bottom half of his class. From his diaries we also know thatlike Union students to- day, he was not overly fond of the food. Ludlow was a member of the Kappa Alpha fraternity, and spent his two years at Union liv- ing on the fourth floor of North College. Though it may not have been reflected by his grades, FitzHugh Ludlow was a brilliant young man and a ~fted poet. It was he who wrote the lyrics to Union's alma mater, \\OdetoOld Union,\ which is considered by some to be one of the country's most beautiful college songs. As the story goes, Ludlow was apparently dissatis- fted with the song upon its completion and threw it away. Fortunately,. his roommate had greater confidence in his abilities and removed the song from the trash. He then proceeded to show the lyrics to Union's then-presi- dent Eliphalet Nott. Nott was ex .. tremely impres$ed and had the song printed. The lyrics were set to the tune of a \drinking ditty\ called \Sparkling and Bright,\ and it. was decided that the song should be sung at that year's com- mencementcetemony. It has been the tradition ever since. Ludlow also wrote another popular descant called \The Ter- race Song,\ whose lyrics reveal indications of a problem which plagued Ludlow for the majority of his short life- his addicti<?n to hashish. \Ye Union men whose pipesare lit, Come forth in merry throng, Upon the Terrace let us sit, And cheer our hearts with song ... \ Sitting on the terrace of donnito- ries and \smoking\ was a favorite pastime for generations ofUnion men, Ludlowbeing no exception. He claimed hashish gave \scope\ to his literary gift, when in actual- ity it proved to be tlie cause ofhis eventual downfall. The year Ludlow graduated from Union, he completed his first book. \The Hasheesh Eater\ was a lengthy work which consisted simply of descriptions of his drug-prompted hallucinations. In reference to this work, Ludlow was described by one critic as \ ... a drugged Dante in reverse, de- scending from. the Paradiso to the Inferno.\ Ludlow also spent time writing .articles and descriptive pieces for thelea(iingjoumalsofthe 1860's, including Vanity Fair, the Evening Post, and Home Jou~l. In addition, he studied law during thisperio<l, p~.the bar in 1859, and then completely abandoned the notion of law altogether. Ludlow married in 1862 and di- vorced one year later allegedly due to problems involving his drug abuse. In 1863, he and a friend crossed tlle United States to California by rail and stage- coach, during which time he wrote another book, \The Heart of the Continent,\ which served both as a record of his trip and as a study of the Mormons in Utah. In 1867, he married again and became seri- ously ill with tuberculosis brought on by his hashish habit. He andhis family traveled to Swit- zerland in 1870 searching for fresh air and good health. Unfortu- nately, it was not to be found, and Ludlow died in Geneva on Septem her 12, 1870 at the age of thirty-four. Ludlow is remembered as a man ofbrilliant intellect, congenial per- sonality and unfailing humor. Though his time at Union was brief, it was undoubtedly the hap- piest of his tragically short life. His feelings about the school are best summed up in an excerpt from a letter he wrote to a former pro- fessor following his commence- ment: \Union has always been one of my idols, I have hardly ever seen the time, even when my prospects in a worldly point of view were most flattering, when I would not have abandoned them to return to the pleasantest home of my life.\

In its infancy, the College was located in downtown Schenectady; in the stockade area. The Union College Campus as Described by Dixon Ryan Fox in Union College.: An Unfinished History The tradition of Ut1ion is embodied in an impressive and cnduringsymbol. Visitorsrernark the charm of its pllysical arrangement and its setting. This is partly due to the coherent architectural plan of its older buildings - the first general college plan in America. Fortunately it has not been sharply violated by the developments on the campus during the past hundredyears In the eighteenth centLJry the College was much nearer the Mohawk River; then Phillip Hooker, the most famous architect in the early era of Upstate New York, designed a graceful hall, completed in 1804, near what was then the border of Schenectady, a site later passed by the Erie Canal. But Dr. Nott, who became president in that same year, found the building too small for the college he dreamed of, and determined on expansi()n along the wooded hill some h.alf-mile farther on With the opp()rtunity he was to deal in characteristically spacious fashion In the winter of 1812-13 the president heard of the presence in Amcricaofagifted Fre11cflman, Joseph Jacques Ramee, who, as an aristocratic emigre from his country, torn by revolution, had het:n court architect in Copenhagen and the gra11.d-duchy of Meek Jenburg-Sch we rin. He had lately crossed the sea at the behest of a wealthy friend who he had known in Europe, and who desired to build a mansion by the St. Lawrence. Dr. Nott invited him to Schenectady and induced him to undertake the whole design of a college on the wide plateau that he had purchased. In 1813, therefore, there emerged \the beautiful plan for Union College,\ as Talbot Hamlin calls it, and as he illustrates it in the first three means of raising funds for public purposes. In these old halls, made more comfortable as time wenton, centers the affection of thousands of Union meri. A slight modification of the Ramee plan enabled the College to extend its primary rectangle to much larger proportions, including the athletic pictures of his notable Greek Revival Architecture in America (1944). \The Union College work,\ he says, \is significant and unique ... and may have had an =\\\'----- ......... _.,....., fields.

A dozen years of lotteries, then a wholly respectable this volunteer part-time labor must have yielded impressive results by 1844, when John James Audubon came to the College, to sell the library the elephant folios of his Birds and Animals of America. He wrote back to Mr. Audubon that he had met Professor Jackson: \I was extremely kindly treated by that excellent man and his good wife too, supped at their House and walked with him through his Superb Garden and Grounds.\ Throughout the eleven acres, largely in the sunken parterre, are trees, shrubs and flowering plants sent home from the Orient by alumni missionaries during the nineteenth century, and gifts from the later graduated, particularly in the Van Voast evergreen garden, the Dunning rosebeds, the Melius conservatory, and the pool ofthe Class of 1906. The same dignity and charm combine, too, in the little walled- plot known as Mrs. Perkins' Garden back of the Old Chapel, in the Hale House close, and in the president's garden, where the iron statue of George Washington (in whose national administration the College was chartered) looks out over terraced lawns and variegated borders. In the east part of campus, it its own grove, stands a massive stone gate- figure, a grotesque lioness and a cub, which in some past century guarded the portal of a Chinese palace. It was dug from the earth near Shanghai in 1861 and some fifteen years later sent to the College by a missionary alumnus. Scarcely had it arrived when it was dubbed \the Idol,\ and it soon became the focus of campus demonstrations, involving many a mimic war; during all succeeding decades any class or group has claimed the privilege of painting it, and not infrequently, when spirit runs high, it displays a succession ofhues within a single week.

The·garden was started as a result of a suggestion of Presi- dent El iphalet Nott when Jackson, then a young professor, suffered from dyspepsia, a bad case of in- digestion. Nott proposed that Jackson get more exercise and so \'Captain Jack' began to dig in the ground.\ After that, Jackson had planted beautiful flowers and shrubs in his tittle patch ofland. President Nott had ventured upon him one day while Jackson was planting and said, \You are doing a good work, Doctor; go ahead and use all the ground you want.\ After that point, the garden flourished with Jackson's cultivating and coHect- ing.ofplants of various types and from various differentcountries. There are about forty different kinds of trees that surround the flower beds. These trees are not always indigenous ofthe area, for example, there is the Japanese ginko. There were even two white peacocks that were donated to the Garden by Dr. Caryl Haskins. They had roamed the Garden un- til Oecember 1938 when they were killed by stray dogs However, they had left six eggs behind and in 1940 three of the new peacocks were put back in the Garden. ·In Jackson's time, there were very few large seal~ gardens so it attracted worldwide visitors. Evenwithinthiscentury, admira- tion came from the famous land- scape gardener Samuel Parsons who said, \Since my visit with you to Union College, enjoyable as it was, the one memory that persistently .stays with me is the quaint old garden; it had so much of the character of a natural, se- cluded, but charming nook in the woods. It was human; too, and very American. No pretense;just a few old fashioned shrubs with wild flowers at their feet, little stretches of turf and an unpre- tending brook running through it out into the little valley lying like an amphitheater with grand old elms over-arching. How fine a combination.\ Perhaps the most famous as- pect of the Garden, according to .students, is the Jackson Garden ghost story. It is said that Alice Vander Veer I ived in the Mohawk Valley with her overprotective fa- ther, Jan. According to legend, their neighbors thought she was the most beautiful girl to settle there. Alice's father would threaten young suitors with his rifle and forbid any man to court his daughter.

TbeCampus The Shear Elegance of Washburn H·all by Suzanne Robinson Arts Editor The demolishing of Washburn Hall marked the first major build- ing to be demolished since Union moved its campus to \the hiH\ in 1814. The corner stone ·Of the build- ing known as the Powers and Washburn Memorial Hall was first laid in June 1881, and building was completed the following year. The name of the building some- times referred to as the \Arcade Building,\ comes from the contri- butions for two separate memori- als. Mrs. Thomas Henry Powers of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania do- nated a sum of$45,000 in memory of her ht~sband. It was to be used in the construction and mainte- nance of a Recitation Hall. The other donation came from the friends of the late Rev. Dr. Washburn, Rector of Calvary Church in New York City, who was a member of the class of 1845. A sum of money was donated to provide of the Library of Union College. Among the contributors to this memorial were William Kissam Vanderbilt, William W. Wright, Samuel D. Babcock, Percy H.

By April of 1950, the renova- tion of the Mounte- banks Theater was almost finished. The remarkable thing about the renovation was that it was done entirely by stu- dent labor( ex- cept electrical work). The dressing rooms were refinished, everything was re- painted, and the theater was completely rewired to make plays \very professional, lighting wise\. In 1963, it was announced that Washburn Hall would be torn down. \Many alumni, faculty, and students have condemned the building as grossly out of propor- tion to the rest of the central cam- ·pus.

The Way We Were, Starring Redford & .Streisand, Filmed at Historic Union by Jody Mousseau Concordiensis Staff In the fall of 1972, Union Col- lege took its claim to fame and found its place on the silver screen. Certain scenes of The Way We Were were shot on the Union campus. Robert Redford and Barbara Streisand, stars of the movie, brought a relatively differ- ent spirit to the campus for a short time. The Cornell University campus acted as the setting for the story in Arthur Laurent's book, how- ever, when it came time to choose the setting for the nostalgic col- lege scenes, it was decided that the Cornell University campus was a much too modem setting. In searching for an alternate loca- tion to film the scenes, Williams College in Williamstown, MA was chosen. However, due to a provi- sion in the contract which forced the camera crew off campus be- fore the beginning of the fall se- mester, the directors again sought fora college campus on which to film portions of the movie. The Union College campus became the lqcation for the filming ofthe col- legiate scenes after the directors visited and were astonished by the beauty of the setting. The Way We Were, produced by Sydney Pollack and Ray Stark, is the story of Katie Morosky, played by Barbara writer. The 1930's setting depicts their nostalgic story.

Both institutions had previously claimed the color magenta, a popular color at the time, as their official school color. Thus, the battle for the right to the magenta began. In 1857, Union published in C arm ina C ollegensia that the of- ficial color that had been chosen to represent the school was ma- genta. The ftrst claim that Harvard made to the color was in I 866. Be lore this date, Harvard's color had been declared as crim- son. The official color of Harvard University had been changed from blue to crimson when the rowing team needed representa- tive colors at a regatta. Years later, the same situation occurred. When the Harvard crew team at- tempted to buy six crimson hand- kerchiefs in Worcester before the annual regatta, they were not en- dowed with such .luck. Magenta, a popular color at the time, seemed to be dominant, and well available, and so the handker- chiefs chosen for the race were magenta. The crew had referred to their color as red, but the news- papers disallowed this to happen by continuously referring to the Harvard color as magenta. In the following years, Harvard took claim to the color magenta. In 1874, a boating association was founded at Union. The fol- lowing year, the school was in- vited to participate in the regatta held at Saratoga Lake. A dispute arose between Harvard and Union as to who had the official right to wear the color magenta at the re- gatta. The dispute was not settled that year, and Union withdrew its right to compete in the regatta. However, despite the Union crew's absence from the race, many Union students attended the regatta, displaying magenta as their official color. This action by students caused controversy, and thus in the following years, a firm claim to the color would be pursued. In early February of 1875, A. V. V. Raymond of Union College wrote a memo to the Harvard Boating Association stating that Union was intending on partici- pating in the regatta at Saratoga Lake in the summer of 1875, and that \it would not be desirable for two colleges to appear under the same color.\ After some confron- tation and mockery of the situa- tion, the possibility of Harvard's return to the color crimson was brought up. Many Harvard alumni favored the idea, and on May 6, 1875 after a meeting of the students, Harvard officially changed its color from magenta to the original crimson. Although the official color was changed, it was questioned what great differ- ence existed between magenta and crimson. However, the prin- ciple of the situation prevailed and Harvard changed its colors. Meanwhile in Schenectady, Union realized Harvard'sjustifi- cation in its claim to the color magenta and changed its color to garnet. The Union College Spec- tator wrote in April that, \Union College has chosen garnet as its color, under which her crew will row on the Jake in July.\ The dispute had been resolved peacefully, leaving nobody with the rigKt to claim the color ma- genta. In July of 1875, both Harvard and Union raced at Saratoga Lake. The Harvard University crew raced in white tops decorated with an \H\ on the breast, along with crimson hand- kerchiefs. Union rowed shirtless, proudly displaying their garnet caps. Union College placed elev- enth out of thirteenth at the Saratoga race in its second year of membership in the Rowing Association of American Col- leges. The root ofthe dispute between Harvard University and Union College rested in ·each crew's claim to the right to proudly dis- play the color magenta one sum- mer day in Saratoga. Both teams established a new tradition, a new representation of their school. The small dispute has had a large The Union College crew team of 1876, who raced for the Garnet and White against the Crimson in The Intercollegiate Regatta. effect on both schools.

II i I I l ! l : l . 1 I : ~i Sports Visitors Not Welcome Here by Ken Berman Sport~ Editor A cornerstone of any success- ful sports team is a place to call home, where they feel comfort- able, a place where visitors are most cert:ainly not welcome .. Fa- mous examples include Boston Garden, the Cameron Indoor Sta- dium at Duke University, and under Touchdown Jesus at Notre Dame Stadium. Though at this stage, Achilles Rink has not yet reached the same level as these fabled venues, it, along with Union College hockey, has it's own historical importance. Cur- rent! y, the hockey program is ex- tremely popular here, with the team competing (with varying success) at the Division One level, in the East Coast Athletic Con- ference. However, home sellouts have not always been the norm . here. The hockey program has had a rocky history, and is now reaping the benefits from the past persistence ofhockey supporters. It is interesting to take a look at Union's hockey story, and how it has survived through the years. Our story begins at the begin- ning of this century. The students ofU nion, who had been petition- ing the school for a hockey rink, won a huge battle, When the isa sue of having a home rink was settled. A representative of the school, Mr. Pond, first received permission, in February of 1903, from the water commissim;}er of Schenectady to use city water for the rink Apparently, this had been the major hassle to the deal. After this was completed, it was only matter of colder weather to arrive, to freeze up the ground. At this point, however, a team had not yet been formed, so the stu- dents still had some work to do. A year later, to the week, both the schools and the students efforts came to fruition, as Union Col- lege -first competed in a hockey game. On Wednesday,February 3, a team consi;sting of seven Union students traveled to the rink of the Mohawk Hockey Club, to take on U.C.I. (U.C.I. don't know whatthatstands for). Their start was successful, as Union triumphed in an exciting affair, 2-1 . Union continued to fie!.d hockey squads for the next twenty-nine years, but the sup- porters of Union hockey were ---------- The Concordiensis · February 24, 1995 · Page B43 dealt a harsh blow in June of 1933. In that month, the Athletic Board voted to abolish hockey as a varsity sport. The reason they gave was that the \mild\ Schenectady winter had allowed the team to play only twenty per- cent of their games, over the pre- vious ten years. Apparently, the weather was a bit warmer back then! The very next month, how- ever, the students replied, saying that they urged the board to re- consider their actions, and rein- state hockey as a varsity sport This protest was successful, and plans for a new rink were soon set in motiota. This rink, however, was ill-fated. In February of 1935, the Union Alumni Monthly reported that it's construction had run into unexpected difficulties. The rink would not hold water, due to the previous blasting of a ditch for a sewer pipe, which ran directly under the rink. This blasting made the ground too po- rous. These problems continued for the following years. and in 1938 a most interesting incident occurred The waterlevel had fi- nally been kept level, and the ice consistent, when one morning a car was discovered to have bro- ken through the surface. This ru- ined the ice, and spilled all the wa- ter Alas, no body was found in the water. and the car's owner was eventually found in Atlanta Henry Laurence Achilles: The Man Who Gal'e Hockey a Honte by Ken Berman Sports Editor On various weekends throughout the winter sports season, thousandsofUnion stu- dents trudge up campus to this venue to see our glorious hockey team in action.

He took over the postofDirectorofRe- ligious Education at Union in 1925, and ~eld this position un- til 1938. At Union, Achilles was never one afraid to get in- volved. He, as much as any- one else, was responsible for the forming of the initial hockey team at Union. He also coached holds his name. This was one of the largest individual gifts in the history ofthe college Construc- tion of the rink begun in 1975 In this same year. he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters honoris causa at the Union College commencement. He also held honorary life mem- berships in the Grand National and the Schenectady, Ardsley, Nutmeg, St. Andrew's, and Union College curling clubs. Achilles lived until the age of 98, when he died on February 19, 1985 at his home in Manchester, VT. He truly lived a long and eventful life, and should be re- membered for more than just giv- ing the College the rink. He was a teacher, the father of a Union graduate, and a friend to all he knew.

'' Page B44 · February 24, 1995 · The Concordiensis The Hockey Scandal that Rocked the Program Ned Harkness, Union's Varsity Hockey Coaclt, who was suspendedfora recruiting violation in 1977. by Dagan Lacorte Concordiensis Staff Union College began its Divi- sion I hockey career four years ago, accepting a bid to replace Anny in the E.C.A.C.. However, it was not the first time Union's been down the big time hockey path. Hockey existed at Union College for the early-part of the century, but disappeared in 1942. It seemed that hockey would tor- ever be part of Union's past, un- til H. Laurence Achilles stepped in. In 1974, the 90-ycar old Achil- les, a fanner Union professor and J. V. hockey coach, donated $1 . 5 million for the erection of an arena. With a new ice rink at its disposal, the future of hockey at Union was very much revived. Instead of starting at the bottom, I ike most new programs do, Union College attempted to put together an immediate winner. In order to achieve this, then President Thomas Bqnner en- 1 isted the services of Ned Harkness as head hockey coach. Union held special meaning for Harkness. as his father was head hockey coach during the 1930's. The younger Harkness was a hockey legend by this time in his career. He led RPI to a National Championship in 1954, and later led Cornell to two more National Championships. His 1969-70 Cornell team posted a 29-0 record, the only Division I team to ever go undefeated. Follow- ing the 1970 season, Harkness was named as coach of the NHL 's Detroit Red Wings, where he later served as General Manager, until 1975. With Harkness at the helm, Union had no trouble recruiting an excellent team for the 1975- 76 season. In his first two sea- sons at Union, Harkness led the Dutchmen to a 46-7-2 record, and despite being Division II, Union had one of the top teams in the nation. However, not everything went well for Harkness. Harkness was suspended in 1977, as a result of a recruiting violation. Harkness broke New England Small College Athletic Conference rules, when he visited a recruit in his home. Harkness denied ever visiting the student, but later admitted the truth say- ing, \I lied, but I lied to save my hockey program.\ The violation was viewed as a minor offense by the school, and Harkness was re- instated. However, Harkness and his team were fast becoming a major controversy on the Union campus. Many within the Union administration felt that Union was compromising its academic integ- rity by admitting some of his re- cruits. The following Spring, four of Harkness' top recruits were re- jected by Union Admissions, stat- ing that they didn't meet the aca- demic requirements. The rejec- tion of these students was a slap in the face against Harkness, since the four students all ended up at Ivy League schools. Harkness continued to coach Union, until midway through the following season. Harkness resigned following December recess. when four of his players were suspended be- causethey were academically in- Sports eligible. Harkness' resignation caused a huge stirthroughoutthe nation. The entire Union team walked-out as a result of Harkness' resignation, V()Wing never to play at Union again without Harkness. Immediately after forfeiting the amateur sta- tus, five ofUnion's players were signed to professional contracts with the Detroit Red wings. The incident gained national media attention, being covered in Tirne, Sports Jllustrated, and The New York Times. Newly hired Athletic Director, Dick Sakal a, was forced to assemble replacement pLayers, in order to salvage the season. Assistant coach Bob Driscoll served as interim coach for there- mainder of the season. Follow- ing the 1977-78 season Charlie Morrison was named head coach, and remained as Union's coach until1985. Seventeen years have passed since Ned Harkness stood behind the Dutchmen bench. Since Harkness' tenure at Union, much has changed for the Union Col- lege hockey program. In 1991, Union College made the move to Division I hockey, and since then has been struggling to become a force in theE.C.A.C..

Instead of reading about how the basketball, hockey, basebaii, swimming, and football teams are doing, you will see stories of ping pong, intramural softball, and what Greek orga- nization held what sporting event. So I guess things change. But if you read the articles of both then and now, what hits you is that no matter what sport is being discussed, there is a certain fervor, an excitement, and a deep interestbehind the article. Even back then, sports clearly had a large impact on people's lives. It is no secret that sports have many differences between them. In this newspaper, I have covered swimming and basketball, and when comparing them the first thing that comes to mind is that many differences exist. There is more action in basketball, and fewer breaks in the action. Swimming is a sport of grace, speed, and style that is mostly individualistic in that there is little teammate interaction; basketball is a contactsport consist- ing entirely of teammate interaction. Iri basketball, there is of- fense, defense, and sometimes even a-little luck, but you will not fins} these in swimming. That does not make one sport bet- ter or worse than the other- just different. So what's the point? The point is that even though all of these differences exist, there are, more importantly, many simi:. larities thattieboth of these, and all other team sports, together- similarities that are the reason we even get involved in sports ih the first place. In a year scarred with both a baseball strike and a hockey lockout, in an era in which it sometimes seems that many play- ers care more about making money than playing the game, in a time in which players often don't even play because of salary disputes, it is important to remember why we even care about sports; why we are drawn to sports and why so many of us make sports such an integral part of our lives. We must remember the reason we play and watch sports at any level- high school, col- lege, professional, etc.; why when we see a newspaper the first section many of us reach for is the sports section; why parents keep sending their kids to play in youth sports leagues and why the kids want to keep playing every year. · The reason is that all sports consist of competition, ·action, camaraderie between players, suspense, and perhaps most im- portantly fun and enjoyment. So, no matter what is going on in professional sports, this is just a reminder of why we love sports so much and why sports are such an important part of so many of ourlives.

Between the years of 1880-1884,.the students ofUnion managed to spur enough interest in the then budding sport to hold some informal practices and intrasquad games. At that time, football was be- ing played on only a handful ·of campuses around the country. There was a league in the l880''s consisting of Harvard, Yale, Princeton and others of which Union did not become a part. However, in 1886, aftersixyears ofintrasquad pla.y, Union finaHy played its firstintercollegic game against Albany Medical School. In the early 1880's The Con- cordiensis was instrumental in sparking art interest in football. The October 1880 issue of The Concordiensis remarked \The · Freshmen have brought a football.

He was affection- ately termed \Blue\ Moore by the entire college, and soon became one of the most popular men at Union, making him on'e of the leaders of his class. 0 n Satur- day, No- vember 25,1905, Moore died at Fordham Hospital, New York City. He wa·s carried from the football field un- conscious, and passed away at 6:40 PM. Born in Ogdensburg, January 6, 1886, . Moore died at the young age of . twenty. His death was due to a cerebral hemorrhage, brought about by a hard fall in the foot- ball game between Union and New York University that day on Ohio field, New York City. His death caused a sensible shock throughout the eastern col- lege world, and started the move- ment for the thorough refonn of football. A meeting of representatives from sixty-four institutions re- sulted in the formation ofthe In- tercolle- g i ate Athletic As so- ciation, which took its present five years later.

Along with the innovation of the forward pass and the requirement of the helmet during play. always gra- ciously pro- vided by the Freshmen calss. Foot;. ball, at that time, defi- nitely had more of a club feel than a team one. Then In 1886, a transfer stu- dent named Charles W. Culver molded what was an unorganized group of scrubs into a formidable team ready for intercollegiiate play. It was at this time that a challenge was made to a team in similar infancy at Albany Medi- cal School. The challenge was ac- cepted and the first Union foot- ball game was played on this cam- pus; in November 1886. Union's opponents were on av- erage four years older than the Dutchmen and they seemed to know a little more about the game. The final score was 8-0 in favor of the Doctors. The next year, an attempt to look more I ike a team uniforms were provided by the players themselves. They consisted of jacket, pants, stockings, and a garnet colored cap, but pads were nonexistent. Apparently the outfits helped, as Union won its first game ever against Cornell in the final game of that 1887 season Charles Culver, the captain from 1886-1888, sprained his ankle in that game and played only one more season. He later went on to become Union's first football coach. From his graduation in 1889 until1895, Culver returned every fall to coach the football program that he spawned. Charles W. Culver is the grandfather of Dutchmen football Union football has evolved from what it was then, an alter- native for guys too big to play baseball (a fall sport in the 1880's and the most popular on cam pus), into arguably the most consis- tently successful sport on this campus. The present day Dutch- men owe a lot to Charles Culver and the efforts of his teammates of old. Before the Celtics and Lakers There Was the Hamilton Jinx by Jason Starr Sports Editor BeforetheCeltics and the Lak- ers, before the Red Sox and the Yankees, even before Union and RPI there existed a rivalry so bit- ter that at one point all athletic relations between the two teams were severed. The rivalry I speak of is the one between the Union and Hamilton College football teams. To call this a rivalry how- ever would be a misnomer. While Union may have considered Hamilton to be its arch football rivals~ it is likely that Hamilton did not give Union the same re- spect. After all, between the years of 1899 and 1923, Union re- mained winless over Hamilton on Hamilton's own Steuben Field. More accurately, this was a jinx. A horrible, seemingly unbreak- able spirit which caused Union passes to go astray, Dutchmen punts to be blocked~ anything it took to prevent a Union victory at Steuben field. The Jinx was born on Novem- ber 11, 1899 in a controversial game at Hamilton College. The controversy began when a Hamilton student, an alleged bookie nonetheless was ap- pointed referee ofthe.contest. It is safe to say that the rules were not strictly adhered to by either side. In actuality, the student spectators were mainly respon- sible for instigating the animos- lies the inception of the Hamilton JinX. For twenty-four years Union could not win at Steuben Field. Many Dutchmen came and went and could do nothing about this blind curse. Then, finally, twenty-four long years later al- most to the day, the Union squad \The jinx was born on November 11, 1899 in a controversial game at Hamilton College. The controversy began when a Hamilton student, an alleged bookie, was appointed referee of the contest.\ ity that led to a severance ofath- 1etic ties between these two teams. Union students were said to have jumped the Hamilton coach after they thought he had walked on the field of play one too many times. The players themselves showed the utmost respect for their oppo- nents. The school and local newspa- pers ofboth sides fabricated the occurrences of the game until they reached scandalous propor- tions. Because ofthis, Union and Hamilton did not p 1 ay each other the following season and therein of 1923 laid the spirit to rest with a 14-0 win over Hamilton. This was no small occurrence for the men of Union College at the time and the event was hon- ored accordingly. A celebratory bonfire raged throughout that No- vember night in 1923. The fire was topped by an effigy of the Hamilton jinx in an effort to rid the earth of its horrible spirit for good. I would say that they did a good job of it because no such jinx has reared its head on this campus since.

AI Bagnoli: A Union College Coaching Legend by Greg Kalish Contributing Writer This is the Bicentennial year, the two-hundredth anniversary of the founding of Union College. It is a year of celebration, a year of remembrances, a year of nos- talgia. And it is a year where we look back and· pay tribute to those people who have made Union College the all-around success that it has become. One of these men is AI Bagnoli. In the storied history of Union College Football, perhaps no one man has personified success more so than Coach BagnalL His .819 winning percentage ranks first among the Union coaches and fifth among all active collegiate coaches in all divisions. Laden with coaching awards and ac- knowledgments, Coach Bagnoli never once experienced a losing season during his tenure at Union College. In his ten seasons, the Dutchmen made six appearances in the NCAA Playoffs and twice played for the National Champi- onship in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl. An excellent recruiter, Coach Bagnoli had at least one player receive a major All- American award from 1982- 1987. Furthermore, he coached the first Capital District player to be drafted by a Natiot?-al Football League team. Coach Bagnoli came to Union College in 1977 after coaching stints at Central Connecticut State and Albany State. During his time at Albany, the Great Danes went 14-6. Hired as a defensive .backfield coach and a defensive coordinator, his defensive units were ranked number one among New England Division Ill schools in 1979, 1981, and 1982. In 1982, Bagnoli was promoted to head coach and guided Union to its first winning campaign since a 5-4 record in 1970. In his first three seasons, Uriion sported con,. secutive 8-1 records before the Dutchmen put together back-to- back 9-0. seasons in 1985 and 1986. Following two consecutive .500 seasons during which Union was in a rebuilding stage, Coach Bagnoliand the Dutchmenputall the pieces together in 1989 with the school's first 10 win season in the 1 03-year history of the foot- ball program. That season, the Dutchmen set schoo 1 records with the most wins during a regular season (10) and most wins dur- ing a season (13). They won the Champion Cup as the top Divi- sinn III team in Upstate New York, the Sports Channell Apple Award as the best team in New York State, the Lambert/ Mead- owlands Cup, and the ECAC TearnoftheYear Award.Forhis efforts, Bagnoli earned the Stan Marsh-Neil Lomax Award as the top Division III .coach in New York State. That memorable sea- son ended with a loss in the Stagg Bowl. ,·· Al Bagnol.i's teams featured explosive offensive pro;wess, sti- fling defenses, and composure. It was these aspects and his recruit- .ing abilities that resulted in his ---teing offered the head coaching job atthe University ofPennsyJ,_ vania; a Division I football pro- gram. At the end ofthe 1991 sea,. son, Coach Bagnoli announced his intention to leave Union and become the 21 sthead coach at the University of Pennsylvania. He wentout in style, however, lead- ing Union to yet another unde- feated season before bowing out to the eventual national 'Champion Ithaca, in the NCAA quarterfinals. lt was Union's fourth undefeated regular season since Bagnoli grabbed the head Union's First Intercollegiate Sport.

COMMENTS ON THB GAME, 'fhe Union boys may well feel prond j of the excellent showing of their players. , The teams were about <qnally matched in weight nnd to the careful and tllorougll training of the wearers of the garnet is due their easy victo1·y, R. P. I. was unable to gain an inch through Union's line; bat in turn holes were found in R. P. I.'s line at_ pleasure. Nothing conlcl stop the quick, snccessi vc play of Union's men aud had the day been cooler, u much larger score would havo been tlle result. If there was any fea.ture of the game more enjoyable thnn t!Je mpid dasht>s of Union's backs, it was the effi- cient guarding and intederence of the whole teum after the kick at the start off. As often as the bt~ll was kicked to Union's backs, it was caught and the man guarded for many bars of the grid iron. If any serious defects of the team 1 w\re brought out, they will be speedily I remedied, for · Ooacber 'fhowpsen watched the game from the side lines with a critical eye. Cap~ain Brown expressed his mtisfac· tiou at tho excellent bebatior of h~s men, and wns much fl\1rprised that such good wmk could be done on so warm a day. It mny be said to the credit of Oaptnin Brown that he managed his players admirably, and their behavior may be attributed to his thorongh energy as a Ol1ptain. '£he teams lined up ns follows: Union.

The Home of Union College's History: The Archives by Heather Reynolds Editor-in-chief Most of the Union population is probably unaware of the occu- pants of the fourth floor of Schaffer Library and the part of the Coll.ege 's history that is housed tllerein. but the staff of The Concordiensis, classes, pro- fessors, seniors writing their the- ses, and curious citizens from as far away as Japan and Denmark have discovered the wealth of in- formation within Union's ar- chives. Ellen Fladger, the resident ar- chivist, did her undergraduate work in history at Mt. Holyoke College and graduate studies in American FolkCultureatSUNY Oneonta. She has worked as Union ~s archivist for fifteen years. Betty A lien, the other full time employee, is the public relations and organizational member of this team She has been working at Union for seven years, and six of them have been in\ .. the best department on this campus,\ the archives She worked in Lamount house for a year in fund raising, but she fe 1t she wanted to work with students more. She loves the one on one work she gets to do with the students, and the knowl- edge about the history of Union Collegethatshe has gained on the job. Karen Molyneaux is the third employee who works in the ar- chives. She works there about eight hours a week along with her position in the library. U nti I 1974, the archives was only a small vault in the basement ofthe I ibrary. At that time, it was decided that all infonna- tion from this vault and the various other ar- chives of organizations and departments should be moved to one loca- tion. The archives collects books written by alumni and faculty, all the issues of The Concordiensis, yearbooks, Freshman Records, the Union magazine, and whatever other materials they come across. They have found that in this age of technology many orga- nizations have taken to keeping all records elec- tronically, which makes it much more difficult to compile records. As a result, they send students out to take notices off bulletin boards because, \These [notices] may be the only record we will have.\ Front row, left to right: Ellen Fladger and Betty Allen, tire two full time employees of the archives. Back row, left to right: Carin Gato, a student employee and Karen Molyneaux, the one part time employyee of the archives. (pltoto by Josh HainesffC) Along with sending students out to pilfer the bulletin boards, there are several other ways they obtain materials. Many times when alumni die, relatives will donate documents relating to their years at Union. There is also a small budget for purchasing ma- terials, and Fladger has contacts with a few local book dealers, and she also checks out bookstores when she travels home to Boston. There are a number of special collections housed in the archives, such as letters from alumni, a rare book collection, and the Frank Bailey collection of American Wit and Humor. Ellen Fladger commented that \Union is very fortunate to have such good local history as well as a history of the college.\ When asked about their best find, Ellen was quick to answer. When she first began working at the archives, she was looking around and found several mam- moth glass photographs of the western United States dating from 1870-1880, taken by Canton Watkins. She is not quite sure why the archives has them, but her best guess is that they were hung in a Geology classroom for decoration at one time. Allen had a little tougher time deciding, but eventually came up with two that were equally as in- teresting. The first was discov- ered while looking through anal- manac belonging to Phillip Schyler, oneofUnion's founders, that had been given to the ar- chives. She discovered a small envelope in the back that was la- beled \lock of George Washington's hair.\ The hair had belonged to one ofSchyler's fe- male relatives. The other was when she was going through some ofthe information from the General Electric scientists, who would submit research informa- tion to the archives. and would occasionally submit samples of the materials they were working. One such sample was discovered labeled radioactive material. The sample was moved outside, and someone came to look at it later on. The archives is open to all members of the Union commu- nity as well as people from the outside world, and many take ad- vantage of it when doing research for books or papers. They do their best to accommodate all who would I ike to use the information, but they must attempt to preserve the material while allowing oth- ers to take advantage of the in- fonnation that has been collected.
