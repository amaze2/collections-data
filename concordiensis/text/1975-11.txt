A student's academic record and extra-curricular college activities are relevant but are not the most important criteria for selection. The Union College Committee reads all of the applications and narrows the field of competition t.o eleven or twelve applicants. These students are interviewed in order to jud_ge the seriousness of their interest in the _program and the organization of their plans. On the basis of the interview and initial application four candidates .are chosen. Nominations must be •sent to the Watson Foundation by November I, 1975.

Recently, in the mailboxes was (sigh!) another q:uestionna·ire. Last year's grad!lation proved to he 110 . exciting that the Comme:ncement - Committee has decided to start R b ,. . o ~ $ r1o-t: from scratch this year. Last June; Dt. Jonas Salk spoke; he was the man who invented the vaccine that prevents polio. President Bonner spoke ( .. I'd like to thank the NCAA for this trophy signifying the -national collegiate hockey charQpions oops, wrong speech~')~ And, the ultimate a;bsurdity, no student spoke. Does this make sense? Students graduate yet do not have the chance to spealc their piece. HoWever, a solution has been put . forth: several students proposed on their questionnaires that a Commencement plan be -instituted that would not only be an educational ideal for graduation, but would attract ·the headlines and publicity for Union acr:oss the country. The proposal .states that Winter Wond.erland - I by ,ROB DAVIS Can you imagine a whole week of winter fun and youthful abandon at Vnion College?

These and many. more issues fall under the jurisdiction of the Hopsing . Office. n·ebbie Kilgus, ·.its director, has made herself available to answer questions and consider any c:onstructive suggestions from students. Th.e process of assigning , _students to rooms is a constant 1 year-round task. Nonetheless, one may consider the cycle to begin in the spring When ·initial efforts are · made to accommodate students . for the new school year.

Tbe competition between groups is divided into categories: Housing· CarousiAg upperclassmen may select This year, a slight discrepancy in Housing's expectations resulted in eleven too many freshmen enrolling. The_se eleven students were placed in five-man .suites \in Fox and Davidson; this number has sinc.e dwindled to five. By the end of this term, due to drop-outs and no-shows, everyone will be accommodated. - ' security was inadequate, this year there are gripes that too much is being . done to protect · the students. If a decision has to be made between either eKtreme, Ms. Kilgus would opt for more security since there is less of a prQblem of stealing, among other things. The·· term-abtoad·- program presents. few problems for the Housing Office. The students Ms. Kilgus regards the security studying overseas this term will measures in many dorms as an return ,to the rooms vacated by issue.. She commented that it is those students leaving for winter necessary for everyone to reach term. When the spring term some sort of comptli)mise - last , students leave, their; rooms will be year there wer:e complaints that occupied by the returning winter term students. Ms. Kilgus establishe§•a correspondence with the students abroad asking them for their room preferances. In this way, every student knows his or her roem in advance of returning to Union. A Housing Committee, comprising of Ms. Kilgus, four students, and a staff member, had its first meeting this week. The goals of the Committee include a program for maintaining dorms, the effect of the ERA amendment on dorm equality, a re-evaluation of the lott-ery system, and a determination of the efficacy of Saga food service at Union. Debbie Kilgus: how suite it is. ·- Ms. Kilgus commends the RA's ort the \really good job\ they are doing this year. She also says that there have not been many problems or requests for ~oom changes, perh~ps because students are taking more time to work out any problems ori their\ own. each student should have the option of giving a one ... minute speech during Commencement. After our big-name, whoever be will be, speaks, the fun would begin. lhe graduates would be ·called up i!l alphabetical. order, as they· grab their diplomas they could address the faculty and their folks for a minute. The possibilities are dazzling. Someone might bring up a guitar and sing a ditty; an aspiring Robert· Frost might compose a poem; would-be impressionists could givetheirspeeches using the .1) ffaternities, 2) male flo()rs, ~) \feinale floors, 4) co-ed i!ldependerits, so that only like groups are ~ompeting against each other. ihe areas of competitio-n include the aivalcade. show, the obst:,tcle course, tl,e parade, the snow sculpture, and the selection of the ,King and Queen. . ' The Cavalcade show includes a musical skit put on 'by each group using their · sub-theme for the scenario. Each skit is judged by the comittee ibased; on originality -of costume and performance and the quality of the act. ~for the obstacle course, each group enters their best skater who competes for tbe best time through the course. Each group makes a float for the- Parade again utilizing their sub~theme as the inspira~ion for their creation. The floats .are judged for th(i:ir originality and appearance. L{lt~r •. the. groups create :OHJ:lOW sculpture based on their sub- theine· and ' this if also judged along criteria similar to the float competition. The King and Queen competition is week-long and 0 .. _ 'Plnlon voices- of Hubert Humphrey or Nelson Rockefeller. Groups o• people might team up for one long meaningful speech. The ceremony migh~ be a bil long, but who cares? Have bee1 on tap, bring picnic baskets. N 01 every student would exercise hi! one-minute option; perhaps onl) two hundred would speak. 01 · course, one could yield his minutt to more eloquent classmates; 01 -(knowing the entrepreneuria • Union students) one might ever se~l his minute. fierce. The groups r~ust campaign, for their candidate because th~ m~re votes they get, the_ mor~i: pomts the group gets m the: competition, Campaigning rnigh~. include ads in Concordy, po!;ters;, flyers, and. handouts all ove.r; campus and singi.ng ;wpeais bi the group in dorms, dining hallsr and fraternity ),touses, or over w·Ruc. The pomt totals for ead;t event are tallied Saturday nigh£ &nd awards given to the winning group in each category plus al} award for the single best overall gro1,1p. The King and Queen are crowned at the Ball and they also receive special awards. Winter Carnival is something that the whole campus. can enjoy . either as participants or spectators.

CONCdRDIENSIS, Wednesday. Noy. 5, 1975 The Crisis of . 1970 -Part U by KELLEY NE~TON Tbis is the second article in a four part series on the actions taken by Union students to protest the Cambodian bombings in the spring of 1970. Following the march Friday, May lst, ~o the main gates of the General Electric plant, Union students were directing their llnti- war activity toward the rally planned for the following Saturday in Washington, D.C. The first weekend in May was Parents' Weekend. and the only anti-war action was the circulation of petitions to be sent to Pres. Nixon, signed by parents and students alike. But on Monday, May 4th, the movement received a new and tragic impetus. Demonstrations at Kent State had started on the Friday after Nixon's announcement of the sending of troops into Cambodia, and the National Guard had been quickly called in. On May 2nd, some 200.0 students were involved , in the. r<i:~ing of the ROTC '. f'~-. building on the Kent State campus; when . firemen artiveq, their hoses were cut and they were attacked with rocks. The situation at Kent State was more severe than at most campuses, and culminated May 4th in the fated shooting of foQr students. Union's reaction was immediate and angry; no longer was this only a war in htdocbina; this was an attack on college students exercising their right to assemble. Just before communication at Kent State was cut off, WRUt was able to contact the cousin (a student lli KS) of its · program director and obtained an eyewitness report. \The National Guard opened fire, and after they opened fire the kid - there was a kid next to them - he rolled over ~ he was goi 0 g to wash windows; he had a bucket and· sponge ~ he pUt the bucket up l:lgainst his face ,;, he and the professor he Was with rolled over into a ditch ... the National Guard took fire and kept firing, after people . were •• \\' .,_ \'..-1 \ I '1 ~ ~ t ~ • ' '·~--. - ,,_: : .. : ::.' ··; ..

One was shot in the neck, and one's chest was blown open. He was pulling the ()ne who was shot in the neck to safety, assuming he was still alive. One .of the professors was pUlliQg the other fellow away,-. and the National Guard, after they'd finished firing, just stood there and watched them pull them away. They said stuff like, ·wen,. you'd better hurry up, because we;re going to start again.\' That afternoon, the ad hoc steering committee of the Strike Committee met with Pres. Martin to .request the cancell~tion of classe('i for the next day, to allow Union students to participate in protest activities and especially activities to protest the deaths _of the four Kent State students. Martin called a meeting of the department chairmen, who agreed Continued on _P•g~ 8 .. \ Union students.staging sit-in on State Street to protest .the bombing of Cambodia. Port of Albany Project by ALISON JAMESON fhe Port of Albany Project is a loosely-knit group of people who visit ships docked at the port. The idea was conceived as a friendly gesture to the foreign sailors on the ships. It is that, but it is also an interesting experience for the students who take part. A typical group from Union might have seven· or eight people, among them a couple of guitar players, perhaps a juggler, some card game enthusiasts, etc. They leave around 7 p.m. on a week night and drive to the port. The people on the ship are expecting \company\ and they look forward to a visit from the American college students. Many of the sailors are young - in their late teens or twenties. Some of them are accompanied on the ships by their wives and pre:school children, The group is met, often by the Captain or First Officer, and usually given a tout of the ship. Music is . a favorite activity, Singing, accompanied by guitar, is done in English and whatever language the sailors speak. Card games' are especially popl;llar:·· When the sailors speak English,· some lively conversations can be heard. Everything from American movies and music, life aboard· ship, world politics, and attitudes among young people, and many other topics are discussed. Various kinds of refreshments are offered, depending on the ship. The. time of departure is around l 0 p.m., after ·everyone has had an entertaining evening. Maurice B.

The actual donation is invested by the ·school with the yearly interest providing the funding for the chair. The chair is .then either .bestowed upon a worthy professor m the specified· department, or used to draw a prominent professor to · the school. IJI some instances, a chair is used on an annual &asis to invite different !;Cholars to the schoor each year, - Depending on how much interest the donation earns . ~ chair can provide all or part of a professor's salary or bu.dge.tary needs (secretary; etc.). Money from the .school's budget that would normally supply the professor's s~acy is retained in the budget to. be utilizedin·some other phase of the school's financial demands .. Union's administratio:n is greatly interested in acquiring new chairs for the -College, As Provost Enteman observes, \They a~e not only good for the budget, they're great· for the professor psychologically.\· A chair is the on·ty symbolic honor that can be bestowed on a full professor .. Rig~tt now, Union has. no functioning chairs that. earn more than the, cost of the professor. ·Dean Lichterman aclrn.owledges that half a million dollars· (with . the' chair ' earning· si~ percent ··-·interest or $30.000 ·annua'Uy} is the. minimum .amo.unt of money . . ~eedid for a: cha:if. to provide the kind of salary that . coUld be . offered )o qraw a professor .from.' outside--:· tfie: ·school's fac_u;lty. Union now' possesses ten cli~hs, one of which; the R'~ger T. Stone chair: remains unfilled.

According to Dean Lichterman, the College .has hopes of obtllining a prominent .p.rofessot to fiU the Stone chair during the spring term .of this year. It has not yet been decided whether the cl:l~Jir will continue to be used on a year ... to-year basis, or permanently bestowed, Dean Lichterman notes that \ahnost every fulf professor holds a chair, at majo.J' universities\ citing Harvard which possesses \scores and scores of chairs\ as an example.

Boston Community in conjunction wit~ Judge Arthur Garrety's decision on the implementation .of FederaJ. Court Order to desegregate .schools. Mr. Warren initiated his somewhat disjointed presentation with a brief. a~count of pa.st incidents which have allowed the present situation in Boston to occ·ur, Daling this account back to Phase l of Judge Garrety's plan, Mr. Warren spoke of .. racists\ taking to the streets by the thousands and attacking the school t>uses, and the black children in them, on the first school day last year. These incidents did not meet the proper actions of either the Boston Police Department or Mayor Kevin White who refused to call in federal troops to .put a halt to the rising illegal mob actions. The fallacy behind the concept of .. neighborhood schools,\ which those opposed to forced bus'tng advocate, was .also attacked by Mr. Warren. He gave the examples of Tech High and South Boston High, two of Boston's better higiJ sehools, which, . · although ·situated in predominantly black neighborhoOds. have up until Phase I tieen atte.nded by only minute percentllges ·of blaclc; students . · T.lltougl)~ut his talk, Mr. Warren referred to Boston as a \test case\' not only for t~e proper education of blacks, but as a stronghold for racist sentiment. This attitude has · been bolstered by the well~otgltnized actions of the \racists who have acted not only through the courts but also ·with terror ·in the streets, and by the mobilization and organization of large numbers. Last Monday, Oct. 27, these \racists\ were able to organize a protest 10,000 strong against forced busing. Such actions, it was pointed out, must be met with opposition mass actions for those opponents of racist actions. Political solutions from today's election are inconceivable, as both Mayor White and his opponent are ardently opposed to busing. The need to educate the ~Qasses as to the issues concerned is of major importance; Mr. Warren indicated that 75% of the American people oppose busing to achieve desegregation. The Book Bus will stop at Union on Monday and Tuesday, November lO and 11~ near the Bookstore, between 10 a.m. and S p.m. The Bus is ll display unit~ featuring books from independent alternative preues.

The show consists of eighty-eigl}t assorted works, chosen by national jurors from an initial entry of 440. The craft show is given every other year and includes the work of amateur and professional craftsmen within a one-hundred mile radius of Schenectady. It is sponsored by the Designer Craftsman Council. The assorted works include • examples of pottery, macrame, quilting, weaving, and jewelry-making. With the exception offive awards given by the jurors, the artists receive no monetary profit for acceptance into the show. However, acceptance carries ·a great deal of recognition and the chance to display and possibly sell their works. The jurors are all relatively prominent in their different specialties. The craft show will be on display at the Schenectady Museum through January 18. HOME DECORATING SERVICES. 11 • ' ~Yermnes Plant R~tD - OFFICE PL!ANTS HANGING' PLANTS ·- POTTERY- .

The following issues were discussed. Provost Enteman was present to answer questions of the Forum. The major questions were in reference to the funding of school activities. Student taxes, it is felt, are not sufficient to fund all activities. Nor is it the responsibility of the students to fund activities which benefit the school as a whole. The Provost recommended a Joint Committee to determine the extent of Student and Administrative responsibilities in this issue. The committee would be made up of Forum members and members of the Planning and Priorities Committee. The joint committee will be responsible to both ' institutions. An increase in Student Tax was \ was directed to determine needs for an increase and report to the Forum. Execution of this directive wiU be postponed until the joint committee has made its report. The poll of student priorities was cancelled. It was resolved that at least one member of the Student Forum be assigned to the various committees (and all areas not covered by committees) to suggest solutions to problems in these areas . by receiving student input in a manner they deem proper, and using their own facilities. They are responsible to the Forum for their actions. OWN FACILITIES. They are responsible to the Forum for their actions.

The Union College Bridge Club emphasizes the very same type of game. There is little difference between the club and the \dorm room\ stance. For instance; each team plays against several team~, instead of only one, which enables one to meet people. A player's scores are compared to many others and a winner is announced at the end. with trophies awarded at the end of the year. As a final plus, there is no penalty for being an amateur, as ali beginners have been graciously accepted and many have done quite well. All I ask is that once every three weeks (only three times per term) vou go to Hale . . House. for a dorm room once removed. I really do think that you'll enjoy it and hope to see you at the next meeting, which is on Tuesday, November 18 at 7:45 p.m. in the Hale House Upper Lounge.

COLLEGIATE BASKEt- BALL, PLEASE COME TO A MEETING ON FRIDAY, AT 4 P~M. IN THE BLOCK .. U.ROOl\1, ALUMNI GYM_: Everyone in the Union community should have received by now a brochure for the Achilles Rink skating program. Some may be curious to know the planning which went into the arrangement of this program. Ned Harkness, Director of the Achilles Rink, met with representatives , from many different groups across the campus to discuss the .. scheduling of skating hours. Even so, Harkness bas arranged Women's Volleyball These groups included the Concordiensis editorial board, the Social Committee, the Athletic Committee, the Administration. the Dean ,of Students office, as. well as the Athletic Committee. What concerned Harkness and what should concern all of us is the problem of how to allow as much free skating time as possible for students, faculty, and staff, and yet still have the Achilles Rink pay for its own operating expenses. things so that students, faculty, and staff, as well as their spouses may ofterr skate for free. Recreational i.d. cards for the spouses of full· time students and employees are available at the Athletic Department office during regular business hours. Thus, every member of the Union College community may skate, during the hours specified in the brochure, with no charge, simply by presenting an i.d. card at the door. Their children have the same privileges, as long as they are accompanied by an i.d. card holder. It is important for us to realize how unusual this free skating is. Most colleges and universities with similar ice facilities charge all but students enrolled in gytn classes and hockey teams for ice time. Let's take advantage of what the Achilles Rink is offering us. There will be skating classes given by outside instructors who are donating their time in exchange for being allowed to give private lessons at the Rink. Skates may be rented or, if you have your own, sharpened at the Skate Shop. Skating with friends, family, or by yourself is an experience not to be missed. by LYNN BATEMAN -- r o date, · the Women's . best ~Ieyed game, but it was a Volleyball team has .played heartbreaking loss to a strong four league games.

With a sweep of its toughest opponents this past week, the Union varsity soccer ' team upped its season record to 9- 2 and moved into excellent positioN for their second post season tournament in as many years. Crushing sixth ranked Colgate 8-1, New England power Middlebury 4-0, and fifth ranked Albany state yesterday 3-2, the Dutchman are playing their best soccer of the year. Last Wedne::.day Union tore into the most difficult part of their schedule with z.est. Hosting on the Red Raiders from Colgate, the Dutchmen were hot for their first win in six years. The Red Raider contingent were ranked sixth in the New York State Soccer standings and, on paper, figured to be the Garnet's toughest test to date. Well so P~Rther crowd with tl;teir virtually flawless play and deft passing, their best of the season. Union's superior play resulted in two more goals later in the half when· Jim ManniNg converted a penalty kick and Parker Antin added a tally on a cross from John Denio. Senior Co-Captain John Denio fVreaks havoc in Colgate defense. much for statistics. From the first minutes of the game the Garnet took control, control they were never to relinquish. Within 6 minutes Union had exploded for a 3 goal lead on goals by Craig Jeffries, George Garavaltis and John Denio. Colgate came back for a lone tally in the first half on Coming off their impressive game in upstate VermoNt the Garnet faced the always tough and well skilled Great Danes of Albany State yesterday. In what was the most emotional game this season Union pulled out a dramatic come from behind win, that virtually assured the team an ECAC play off-berth. The now 9th ranked Dutchmen were surprised by a quick two goal outburst early in the first half as the Great Danes took advantage of an indecisive Garnet defense to jump ahead. Characteristically, however, Union refused to die in this, the most heated of soccer rivalries. Co-Capt. Craig Jeffries started the Garnet come-back effort with a loose ball goal about mid-way through the first half. Shortly thereafter John Denio roared down the right side, drew the Alb-any netminder out and deftly pas~ed to George Garavaltis for the tying score photo credit: Don Hamerman Hobart Swamps Garnet Gridders by CHARLES FLANAGAN AND HANK HEALY After a beautiful week of practice following a 21-0 defeat of R PI, the rain again began to fall as a powerful Hobart team arrived on Saturday. Hobart's senior captian Rich Kowalski, the 210 ·lb. All-East back, treaded for 203 yards on 30 carries and two touchdowns as the Statesmen reversed the score to 21-0 over the Dutchmen. Alexander Field resembled more of a swamp than a football field yet the condition didn't seem to curtail the offensive powers of the Hobart team as they grinded out a total' of 344 yards on the ground. \The wet didn't seem to bother him too much,\ Cahill pondered, \but that's the way it is with the good ones. They can run under any conditions.\ Cahill didn't seem too disappointed about the amount of yards his defense yielded. \Actually we didn't play that badly on defense,\ he said. \Kowalski broke a couple on us, but overall I thought we contained them pretty well.\ Hobart did all its scoring in the first half, and allowed Union to penetrate past midfield only once. The second half was played under conditions similar to a monsoon. The steady rainfall hampered play and saw the field conditions bordering upon unplayable. The Dutchmen drove to the Hobart I only to fumble away a scoring opportunity. Similarly, the Statesmen drove to the Union II before committing a similar turnover. Hobart, winner of five out of seven, scored on their first possession of the ball. An II play-59 yard series was capped by Kowalski's two yard plunge. Tom Thon's first of three PAT-kicks made it 7-0. fhe second Hobart touchdown was produced in a very quick fashion early in the second quarter. Guess who? Yep, Kowalski slashed through the Union defense and out ran two defensive backs on a 48 yard scamper with II :05 left in the first half. Kowalski went over the 1,000 yard rushing mark for the season in his afternoon workout. He would have scored a third touchdown in the fourth quarter but was dragged down and dunked from behind by John Ballard after swimming from his own 4 to the Union 42, a 54 yard jaunt. \l think he might have been hurting a little late in the game,\ said Cahill. \He was getting hit hard all day, but he took our best shots and kept coming back. He's strong, has great balance and is an aggressive ball player.\ Not to be overshadowed by Kowalski's performance was great effort by Union's Jerry Logan. Logan picked up 102 yards rushing on 18 carries, including some big gains in the second half. \I thought Logan played very well,\ Cahill praised, \and thought Tom Hood was excellent on defense. We played evenly with them in the second half and I was glad to see our kids hang in there and not pack it in. There's no denying that the weather had its effect. Both teams had all they could do to stand up out there.\ The rain and a stout Hobart defense held the Union offense in check. The Dutchmen were. never Continqed on_ Page I I Quarterback Mark Broomfield unloads under pressure in Saturday's l~ss to Hobart. photo credtt: Les Trachtman a brief lapse by ·the Union fullbacks, to make the score 3-1 at the half. If the first half scoring outburst was sudden, the Garnet's second half offensive sent Colgate reeling. Jeffries got the show goil)g early in the stanza as he netted Unions fourth goal on a hummer to the far post. Jim Manning, last weeks reserve goalie in the RPI win, added a penalty kick minutes later as Union continued its relentless pressure on the hapless Colgate goaltender. Goals by Denio, Parker, Antin, and Garavaltis closed out the game for the Garnet while their crushing victory vaulted Union into the States top 10 at the #9 position. It is impossible to give credit to any one player in the Colgate game; needless to say when a team sets a game scoring record (8 goals) against one of its most difficult opponents a total team effort is necessary. Possibly the biggest story of the day was the very creditable performance by Freshman reserve goalkeeper Mark Reckucki. Reckucki filled in for the injured Chris Huban and turned aside several Colgate threats with dramatic saves. Over this past weekend the Garnet booters travelled to Vermont to take on the defense minded Middlebury Panthers. Continuing their high scoring ways the Garnet tallied four goals against a Panther defense that had allowed only three scores in their last eight games. Playing before a highly vociferous partisan crowd the Garnet defense dipped in with a hruising shutout effort to hring home a 4-0 verdict Forging ahead. at their rccordbrcaking pacc the (iarnt>t broke their ..,easnn team ~coring record. amassing V• goal\ thi' season, while Cra1g .lcffrle~ tied his season record of 13 goal performance w1th two tallies.

Outhustling the Middlebury eleven all over the field, Union drew oohs and ahs from the Both teams came out smoking after half-time as superior head after excellent pass marked the play on both sides. Union was successful for the most part in controlling the mid-field area as once again Ralph Roumain was the paragon of stability at halfback. The action was fast and furious all through the final stanza; as the last minutes ran down, it appeared as if the unofficial district championship game would end in a tie. The Union squad was hardly about to let their superior effort go to waste. With about 55 seconds left in the game, Senior Co-Captain Craig Jeffries cut in across the 18 yard line, knifed between two Albany defenders, and bore down on the goal. Craig wasted no fancy moves on the Great Dane goalie, and his bullet shot found its mark in the lower right side of the goal to send the team to its most emotional victory of the year. With only one game remaining (against Trinity). the Garnet boaters (9-2) are a shoe-in for the ECAC tournament and stand a good chance of hosting the annual post season fete. Characterized by a stingy defense and an explosive offense, Union could very well finish with its best season ever.

With Saturday's win 1J nion matched last ye~r's overall record and hopes are now high that the squad •can add to that total in the upcoming BCAC Tourney (Nov. 14). Ga·rivaltis broke the ~ch(>ol rec.ord for season a~sists passing to John Denio and enabling the senior co- captain to tafly on a screamer from the eighteen yard line. Trinity, playing the traditional American kick-and-run. brand of soccer, was able to rally for two tallies W.ith the wind at their backs in the seco-nd half. Fortunately the defense held on, as. they have done all yeat, to bring home the bacon. On a windswept Trinity ·pitch, Union never trailed and actually dominated the contest to a greater degree than the score ·would indicate. Playing f0r most of the tilt without the services oLeo- captain Craig Jeffries who suffered hyperextension of the knee against Albany State, the Garnet jumped ahead on two first-half goals. With o_nly fifty-two seconds gone Jim Manning looped a corner kick past a surprised Bantam netminder. Later in the. half frosh John Kovacs drilled home the second Garnet goal, firing into an open net after a . beautiful pass from Parker An tin. In the second half George In an otherwise anti-climactic contest, the game ball should go to the Union halfbacks. Don Ward, Ralph Rournain, Rich Earl and Bob Hoga!l virtually shut down the Trinity short passing game and forced the Bantams into a low percentage long ball offense. Enjoying a well-earned week off, the Ga.rnet soccer team awaits news of the BCAC bids to come out the lOth. With momentum on their side, and a solid shot at the top (home field) seed, this rude writer picks Union to go all the way. Rugby Beats Army The Union Rugby Club travelled down to Vassar last weekend to play the West Point · D's and Vassar B's. they returned with two more victories added to their record-breaking season total (\A\ Team 4-1-1,. \B\ Team 3-2) as the \A's\ trounced Army 17-0 and the ••B's\ edged Vassar 8-4. The Army game was never in doubt as the Garnet scored before five minutes of the game had elapsed. The try was regis~ered by Don Leach when he picked up a loose ball near the goal and carried it in for the score. The team never lost its initial momentum and continued to score throughout the game. Greg \Kegs\ Walker and Dave Papa, both of DU fame, demoralized the opposition with pinpoint kicks at key moments in the match and a hustling serum led by Captain John Andrews and Andy Walsh quickly followed them up. Bill \Poodle\ Glavin was the hero of the line-outs, consistently out-muscling the Cadets to pull in the bail. am Fellows kept the pressure on with three penalty kicks for nine points and Chris Taylor scored the second tF)' to put the gam~:: out of ·reach. The \B\ game score was much closer despite the Union team's domination of the game. Although they kept the ball in the Big Pink's half of the field, the Dutchmen were um~ble to score during the first half. Then in the beginning of the second half, Vassar scored. Enraged at the audacity of this move, Union came roaring back to score two unanswered trie;s within ten minutes. Outstanding in this effort were fly-half Dave Papa and wing forward Mike \Rock\ Thompson, both of whom scored, Terry Trembath, also excelled with many a fine defensive play. But special praise must go to Joe \Rocco\ Oiovannone for keeping the ball out of Garnet territor)' with a well coordinated combination of runs and kicks. The post~game party was also dominated by the Union men. Coming off o:f injuries which had prevented them from playing in the games, Steve Klak and rookie Burt Slavin turned in superlative performances as they outlasted many of their Army counterparts. Mike \J.B.\ Thompson · and gimpy-legged Jim Stants amazed the Vassar women with their instant recall of all the favorite rugby tunes. The highlight of the evening, however, came when the Army Cadets demonstrated the infamous elephant walk in front of the open-mouthed Vassar coeds. Although some Union R.uggers were seen to blush, all agreed that it was an \educational experience.'' Needless to say, many are looking forward to the party following this Saturday's horne contest between the Union ··s\ team and Hartwick. \If my pieture isn't on the page, it aio't worth doin' .. \' .... John Busterud Football con't by HANK HEALY .•. On the other hand Though Charlie may not believe it, Union does have a bright spot. Bob Mathias, number 33, is presently in line for NCAA recognition for his kickoff returns. Bob currently has seven for a total of 176 yards making his average a solid 25 yards per return. Bob has not broken one as of yet but he is due. He has often been stopped by the one remain\ng man between him and the goal line or by slippery conditions, which have dominated this season~s Saturdays. Tim Pangburn deserves recognition in the Williams game for his defensive efforts. Tim made tackles that ranged from the Williams backfield to the Union secondary.

If Union persists in playing schools the like of Hobart, Rochester and Williams, it is going to take more than just a quality coach to achieve any kind of winning year. It was evident fro.m Saturday's performance .that Union lacks the caliber of foqtball they are presently scheduling. Anyone who attended th() Williams game saw this. fact.

After years of humiliating defeats, you'd think something would be done to eliminate this tragic problem. ..If we're going to compete with Williams in the NESCAC, we're going tQ have to start operating under the same conditions.

Just seven minutes later the Ephs attempted a 20 yard field goal but it was blecked' at the Union 10. Union took over possession, and on the third down, Dutchman QB Mark Broomfield was all but decapitated by a .swarm of hungry Ephs, fumbling the ball into the end zone where Willfams' middle guard Emmet Creahan recovered for T.D. number two.

Volunte~r Day: Alternatives to Classroom Learning by SUSAN FINKELSTEIN Union College's Volunteer Day focuses our attention on one of the most important lessons we continue to learn throughout our lives: when we contribute, we receive.

For it is simply incorrect to assume that the students on this ! campus will be aware of .. what is happening\ even if Concordy ·attempted to publish highlights from the manifold pages of minutes from the more than two score committees. The assumption is false, '\not because students would not bother to read the committee reports (which may, in any case, be true)~ but because there is a plethora of important decisions made by the Administration independently and irrespective of committee recommendations, of which Concordy is either belatedly or never informed. In filet, it seems rather ironic that this letter should arrive so soon after an important meeting called by the Provost to introduce selected \student leaders\ to Mrs. Paula Brownlee, the Administration's choice to replace Martin Lichterman as Dean of Faculty; a meeting to which the Editors of Concordiensis were either carelessly or intentionally not invited. The President's statement appears eyen more absurd when one ponders the numerous ·occasions when memoranda of purportedly great import to students, disseminated from the Office of the Dean of Students, are sent without hesitation to both the Campus Chronicle and Union's Week and not to Concordy. That Concordiensis, surely the most widely read and distributed campus publication, is singularly omitted from recetvmg these · notices is both. negligent and irresponsible. One faculty member said to me the other day, \the only way to get their attention is to shout loudly enough ... if you don't, they'll ignore you.\ I should not hesitate to agree with this assessment of the present situation. Given an Administration which has gained - and justifiably so ·_. the reputation of being excessively \public-relations\ conscious, it is disquieting to find these same individuals ignoring Concordiensis and thereby impamng the flow of information from Administrators. to students. Lacking the forekno~ledge of important campus actions and events that would otherwise remain the sole property of the Schenectady Gazette, Concordiensis is unable to adequately inform students as to certain issues that directly affect them. So long as the Administration continues to bypass Concordy as a communications. medium, and the present state of disrepair continues to p·ersist, the stu,dents of this College will remain unaware ·Of much that goes on in their own backyard. JMS you said-if a union plus Editors Concordiensis: For the past year '1 have been attending exhibitions at the Union · College Art Gallery, and for the past year 1 have wondered why so few members of the College community take advantage of this facility. I w~;mld like to make an open plea to the Administration, and all interested, to come and see the exhibit, enjoy the display, and most important, support the institution. Unfortunately, because of a general lack. of student intere.st and insufficient funding, the gallery suffers from a shortage of space and a .lighting system which prevents an adequate display of the art pieces. Although Union College has the reputation of being primarily a science and engineering school, there are many people on campus who would ~tppreciate and like to further their education in the fine arts. It is clearly the arts which, although being a severely limited program, provide the campus with the greatest number of new and excitiqg experiences ' (Cabaret, Mountebanks, etc.). The Union College Art Gallery is not only a major source of cultural enlightenment, but it allows for the creative . and imaginative expression that is so desperately rieeded on the Union College campus. For those of you who are concerned about the future of the arts at Union, and moreover, the quality of student life ~t Union, 1 urge you to support the Gallery. ,. Sincerely, teri s.

From a. small school newspaper, this should not be an unreasonable demand. l have written this both for personal clarification and to make the following suggestion: Concordiensis reporters ought to consider making !ill effort to contact personally the sources of their reporting.

The proposal augments student contribution in the tenure process: the student body fills the Fieldhouse to watch candidates battle in Roman gladiator style for tenure. Facuity candidates would be equipped with swords, spears, helmets, and armor and then fight .until one can no longer rise. The students would then give him the thumbs-up or thumbs-down as to whether he should remain on the faculty. Thus a greater student- faculty rapport will evolve and professo.rs will be more accountable to the whims and caprices of an educated student body.

Page 4 CONCORDlENSlS, Wednesday, Nov. 12, 1975 arts A touring .show of p~otest posters, \Up Against The Wall,\ stops at Union through Nov. 15. Art Show: Protest Art by DIANE NELSON .. We are accustomed to· art dealing with eternal truths; showing man undergoing the perennial and unpreventable in experience. But art which is social art depicts social man~made conditions, man at grips with conditions neither permanent nor necessary that can be changed if needed.\ So said Franklin Carli~le in his lecture entitled \The Art of Protest Posters.\ Carlisle, a Union College Sociology professor, was the guest speaker at the November 5 opening of the Union Gallery's Protest Poster exhibit. The exhibit consists of forty protest posters, chosen from a touring show of ~·eighty. Two hundred years of history, beginning in 1774, and various countries are represented. . Although the posters were not produced to be framed and hung, art is intrinsic to them. The development of multi-color stone lithography in the 1870's made modern art .posters possible. This was the beginning of the production of posters suitable for framing. phrase derived from the violent instruction police gave to those they overpowered. It indicates the submissive posture in which you lean against a wall with both hands and legs spread out. As a slogan it suggests· that from this posture it takes only a few turns -of bodies to produce the posture for political execution.\ The posters. illustrate the unfortunate fact that over the years man's inhumanity to his fellow man has not decreased. The exhibit will be on display in the Union Gallery through November 15. Records: Who the Best? by DAVID MOSKOWITZ Anyone who speaks of the Rolling Stones as ''The World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band\ had better take a long hard. look at The Who. Tossing aside the synthesizer for The Who By Numbers, Pete Townshend and The Who have created what is probably their most bitter and most compelling album yet. By Numbers is a simply packed single album following in time an elaborate double \concept\ album (just like Who's Next followed Tommy). At first glance, the listener might consider the 10 songs to be un·related, but closer examination reveals. that the album has a very· personal concept. townshend is coming to grips with himself as rock star as well as trying, to cope with the. close-mindedness of fans and managers, stifled artistic freedom, ~nd aging. 7 ; Shunning his ARP and Moog, Townshend sticks to creating some sizzling guitar licks. Now that The Who have overcome the stigma of punk-rock guitar smashing, Townshend has become rock's most versatile and prolific ~uitarist; even mandolin and banjo come into play, but they merely acoustically replicate his electric riffs·. Townshend has not retrenched in making By Numbers, but has brought his pattern of writing about the failures of stardom to its natural climax: a Who self- portrait. All the songs fit in, giving the non-concept album a ·statement for now. He ha~. matured as a singer, broadening his range beyond Daltrey's, and has added an extra element of fire and emotion that Roger lacks. Ev-en when not· s:in.gin.g, Townshend lyrically fills each song with great pa~siom and bitterness. Orr the surface,, \Blue Red, and Grey\ does not'have this quality. Townshend sings beautifully of how he likes \every minute of the day.\ At the same time, though, he criticizes the rock faddists, saying, \.So you see I'm . cornpl~tely crazy 1 l even shun the South of France.\ Jokes pervade By Numbers, but not to the degree that they hide the . ominous descriptions 6f the decadence of rock culture. John Entwistle's \Success Story,\ a sort of Who autobiography, is filled witl). his usual sarcastic lin~s: \Someday I'll make it/ I'm gonna be a SUpe(~Uper Star ... j I'll even get a hems~ for my mom\; • \fm: · your fairy manager/ You shall play Carnegie Hall\; \Six for the taxmanf four for the band.\ \Squeeze Bo:x;\ is a sort of Townshendian sex joke. As Townshend reflects on hjs position and rock's .position in the world, his songs grow angrier.. In \How .Many Friends,\ he despai:rs · of ever hearing the truth again and complains of the two-faced nature of fans' and managers: \People !mow nothing about their own soft gut and soul How come they all can without suffering all the heart bleed we-know.\ No optimism.abo~t h.um&n na~ure r~tnains, witn even Entwistle disillusioned: \Take 276. You know, this used to be fun.\ 'They're All ln Love'' is the album's strongest cut, both musically and lyrically (no cut ranks w.ith tbe li4!s of \Baba O'Riley,\ but what does?). Townshend blasts an unna.med r~ck magaz.in~'s penchant {or nosta;lgia: \Where do you fit in· lto/o&¥sO magazine/· Where the past is a hero and the present a queen?/ J.tist tell me right now, where do you fit in/ With mud in your eye and a passion for gin?''-' Throughout Tbe Who By Numbers, Townshend and The · Who take swipes at themselves, their fans, and our culture. While at times seeming to regret his current hypocritical life (\I am a plain man tied up in life\) and desiring self-determination (''I'm dreaming of the day., can control myself'), Townshend remains obstinate. Having always. denied time',.s effects on them (the classic Townshend quote: \Hope l die before I get <>ld\) The :Who have finally reconciled themselves to the 'fact that they cannot escape from growing old, from their own images, or from the evils of the world. As a result, they rhaY have created their greatest album. Only time will tell if coming to grips with their ••own soft gut · and , sottl,\ can mark the end of a great musical grottp. somerset rt<al unity. . • . :'The Who 'have been struggling p••••••••••••••-•••••••••• .. internally of late. Roger Daltrey, . K,eith Moon, and John Entwistle all have broken from the group at · one pQint or another to pursue solo projects. Apparently Townshend has been saving his RAMADA INN~ Welcome~ Union Students THE OX STEAK Roast Rib Restaurant La Gondola Seafood Restaurant But the main reason for this form of political/social art is to lead on to action. The people illustrated in these posters are victims: Protest posters appeal to people for' help for these victims. The use of this art form proves that art can serve outside the gallery, on street walls.

The wiring of the campus, w h i c h has b·e en u n de r ·consideration for two years, was made feasible by the construction of Achilles Rink. In exchange_ for the rights to broadcast the home hockey ~games on the OT8 channel, the cable company would wire specific rooms on the campus, such as lecture halls, labs, and the computer center. This wiring job will make it passible to send and receive video between these rooms. This ·Capability wiH make it possible for Union to receive grants to purchase audiovisual equipment for various purposes. Lectures by visiting speakers could be taped and replayed; standard lectures, . such as how to operate the keypunch, could be taped and played back at the students' convenience on a monitor at the keypunch itself. Professor E.J. Craig has said that theFe are so many possible Uses for this system that no one could list them aU &t this time. He has. pointed out that this system will allow the campus to send and receive communications from Albany, and that Albany can trade signals with a satellite; leaving the possibilities for Union broadcasts to anyone's imagination. On fhe other· side of the deal there is some concern .about the consequences - of anowing Schenectady Cablevision to broadcast th.e games'. Ned Harkness, hockey coach and rink manager, believes that hockey is··a difficult game to televise even for national ~ network cameramen. l-hirkness feels that people who. see Union hockey for the first time on an OTH b'roadcast, may ·be discouraged from attending the games in person. And in the cold of the Schenectady winter, it may seem to be a mote attractive proposttton to the potential season ticket pun;:haser .to stay home in his living toom to see the g(!.mes. There is also a. concern, as expressed .by P~ofessor Kirshner .of the Athletic Committee, that the cable company may have to remove seats and perhaps obscure the view ftom .other seats with their cameras. Harkness said that he had no objection to the video coverage :or other events in the rink, such as concerts, ice capades, etc. which are· not as difficult to follow as is ice hockey. The fine points of the contract have yet to be ironed out. When more has been definitely decided upon concerning this maHer, you w,ill be the first to know.

The chief organizer of Volunteer Day, Jo Anne Flynn, who is working in Union's placement office as a graduate intern in S. U.N. Y .A.'s student personnel services pr.ogram, has an inch-thiCk stack of file cards representing more than 100 volunteer jobs available in Schenectady County. The jobs range from reporting for Schenectady's new \alternative\ newspaper, The New Citizen, to doing legal research for the N.A.A.C.P., to leading discussion groups on self-awareness. and decision-,making at· local Boy's Clubs. So major an effort to recruit student volunteers has never been made before at Union. \Students bring an important dimension to community work,\ said Nancy Dunne, director of the Voluntary Action Department of the Human Services Planning Council of Schenectady County. She said she was \delighted\ when Flynn came to her with plans to hold Volunteer Day, Volunteer work can help students learn how to work with other people in organizations, \sometl).ing that can't be learned in the classroom,\ says Jo Anne Flynn. It also gives a student the chance to try out a certain field to determine whether it is one he or she wishes to make his or her career. In addition, volunteer work can gain students job experience and recommendatipns which may help them obtain paying jobs later on, and will often impress graduate admissions officers. For many, however, the simple pleasure of doing something to help is sufficient motivation to volunteer. Volunteer work can change the way a student looks at life. Ken Zimmerman, for instance, was disillusioned by his highly analytical pre-med studies in chemistry and biology when his faculty adviser recommended that he go to the Placement Office and get into volunteer work. When Flynn told him about Oak Hill School, Zimmerman liked the sound of it and applied for work as a counselor. Jon Tobiessen, director of the school, was impressed by Zimmerman's enthusiasm and interest, and took him on. That was six weeks ago. Today Zi.mmerman sees his education in a different light. \When I go back to my schoolwork, it has more meaning,\ he says. At the same time, Zimmerman feels he is improving both as the doctor he hopes to be one day and as a person. Zimmerman will have three Continued on Page 8 Travel in Europe College students are gong to Europe in increasing numbers. The availability of temporary Work and student travel discounts in Europe are two reasons for the trend. For example, volunteer service positions and temporary jobs are available in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany, Holland, and Switzerland. Once in Europe, a host of student privileges are obtainable. The combination of being able to earn at least free living accommodations, and in many cases additional money for travel, while having a broadening cultural and life experience is a practical and educational attraction. Also, the added allure of the Winter Olympics this year (in Austria) is reason enough for skiers to pack up and go.

Union College is presently a member of the Institute for Off Campus Experience and Cooperative Education, known succinctly as the Venture Program. Since its founding in 1972 this affiliate of ]\jortheastern University has acted as a job bank/ placement service for collt:ge students who for various reasons want to take off for from three months to a year and get a job. Since last winter Union has been a member of this program and in t<he past few months four ot its students have used the services of the Venture Program. I was one of those students. I returned for reasons that will be discussed below but the three others are still at their jobs. What are they doing? Why did they do it? · To many students school has become a drag. After twelve years in public school and then four more years of college the reasons for going to school become lost in a mire. To the four students who are on. this program, a break from school was a prime reason for their leaving Union. Karen Weischadel, who is a senior Chemistry major, is presently working for Lever Brothers in the Proces!l Engineering Department. She said, \I decided I had enough school. I wanted to be out on my own and see w,hat kind of job I could get and what it would be like to work as a chemist.\ Geoffrey Blum, who started this September at Tymshare, Inc., a computer time-sharing corporation, gave a similar response: \I wanted to take off fwm college, 1 was tir~d of going to school, not Union in particular, but school in general.\ The other main consideration for taking advantage of this program was to test out career interests. For myself this was a prime reason for entering this program. l wanted to see if I would like to be a journalist, but I really was not sure. I found a job on a small newspaper in Worcester, Mass. There I learned that the life of the newspaperman was not for me. l therefore returned. after the summer q;nd did not continue in that pursuit. I still do not know what I want for myself, but I at least crossed off one area from the list and began to think in other areas.

Nott Memori,al Bite·s M.an An unidentified transient was decapitated by falling pieces of stone during the intermission of a performance of \Skin of Our Teeth\ in the Nott Memorial. The pieces fell from a stone molding along the upper edge of ~he outside wall of the lobby, where a photo exhibit of the play had been placed. Eyewitness accounts differ as to just what occurred, mstst that science can explain everything have. entirely missed it. Those pieces of stone fell because the Nott Memoria·! wanted them to fall! · Put yourself in its foundation. Midnight .

While money is being spent all around you on ordinary buildings, you, the gem of the campus, the very embodiment of the institution, are being allowed to decay. Of course, you would revolt in time. You would show . them that if they don't get started on some repairs here and there, they might wake up one morning and find themselves with only a pile of antique slate and some missing students. In one of the most startling and mystifying occurrences to hit the campus in yeats, the Old Blue Gate, which has denied Nott Terrace drivers direct access to the campus·· for- almost one hundred years, was torn limb from limb Monday night. How or why the gate was so abused is currently t~e subject of what must be called fruitless speculation. One theory has it that the gate was dislocated by a maniacal driver who reached tb,e end of Nott Terrace and found himself going ninety mile-s an hour without being ·abh! to turn left or tight After plummeting through the gate,. this driver and his apparently indestructible automobile are. believed ·to have driven straight down to the flagpole, where a left turn was made, taking car and driver over the wall and down towards the West College parking lot, out of which the maniac's escape is believed to have been made. This theory is a typical example of the thinking evident where people refuse to acknowledge that forces are at w<;>rk which we can neither comprehend nor exp.lain. The gate-half which was torn right oUt of its iron hinge weighs so , much that . three bur1y Concordiensis personnel were unable to budge it. Could an ordinary automobile have done that damage and still be able to drive from the scene.? No water or oil was found. And at the site where the alleged left turn over the w~ll took place, the grass was found to be undisturbed. Could an automobile massive .enough to ram through .a massive iron gate then take a turn off a four foot wall and leave no mark where it struck the ground?

CONCORDIENSIS, Wednesday, Nov. 12,,1975 Page 9 s~trange ·OCcurrences Hit ·Union Campus Sc~ne of the strange Blue Gate incident. Nott Me·morial Bite·s Man An umdentified transient was decapitated by falling pieces of stone during the intermission of a performance of \Skin of Our Teeth\ in the Nott Memorial. The pieces fell from a stone molding along the upper edge of fhe outside wall of the lobby, where a photo exhibit of the play hac;l insist that science can explain everything have entirely missed it.

You would show . them that if they don't get started on some repairs here. and there, they migbt wake up one morning and find themselves with only a pile of antique slate and some missing students. In one of the most startling. and mystifying occurrences to hit the campus in year~. the Old Blue Gate, which has denied Nott Terrace drivers direct access to the campus,. for almost- one hundred years, was torn limb from limb Monday night. How or why the gate was so abused is currently tl\!.e subject of what must be called fruitless speculation. One theory has it that the gate Was dislocated by a maniacal driver who reached tl:te end of Nett Terrace and found himself going ninety mile-s an hour with'o\lt being 'able te turn left or right. After plummeting thtough the gate, this driver and his apparently indestructible automobile are. believed to have driven straight down to the flagpole, where a left turn was mad:e, taking car and driver over the wall and down towards the West College parking lot, out of which the maniac's escape is believed to have been made. This theory is a typical example of the thinking evident where people r~fuse to acknowledge. that forces are at work which we can neither comprehend nor explain. The gate-half which was torn right out of its iron hinge weigns so , .. much that . three budy Concordiensis personnel Were unable to budge it. Could an ordinary automobile have done that damage and still be able to drive from the scene? No Water or oil was found. And at the site where the alleged left turn over the wall took place, the grass was found to be undisturbed. Could an automobile massive enough to ram through a massive iron gate then take a turn off a four foot wall and leave no mark where it struck the ground? No, it is obvious that those who believe that the gate was broken down .bY an automobile are those • who refuse to admit that this is an undeniable instance of supernatural intervention.

At the meeting were representatives of Saga Food Service, including the Food Service Manager and the District Supervisor. The food service situation at Union was discussed at length. Student gripes were presented and Saga agreed to take actions to remedy many of the situations. The Forum, to insure that such actions are taken, will present a checklist to Saga. The checklist will be reviewed early in the winter term by the Forum. If the checklist is not fulfilled to the satisfaction of the Forum, the Forum will search for a new food service. Linebacker (course evaluation) requested the backing of the Forum. The Forum consented, and agreed to write letters to faculty members requesting that they hand out questionnaires during classes. The Committee on Committees recommended that three types of sanctioning be considered for clubs in the future. It will now be recommended to the Forum by the Committee on .. Committees that a club be considered either (I) sanctioned with fundings, (2) sanctioned without funding, or (3) not sanctioned. The Student Forum agreed to sponsor a Symp<>sium for the Arts.

Their first two wins came Nov. 4 when they· (ravelled to AdirondackCC (who was hosting Union and Castleton College). Union toQk. ·on Castleton first, and played an excellent match. In the first game ofthe match Union was ahead when Castleton began catching up. Union hustled and outplayed them to win 16-14. in the second game, Union killed Castleton 15-l lo win the match. Union then played a ~eaker Adirondack CC team, .. and demolished them 15-1, 15..0. The second ga!Ile was a joke as Liz )'ager served a straight 14 points, and the game was over in three minutes. The next night Union played Albany St. again at Albany and won in three exciting games. There was good serving and st'rong sp~king on both sides as Albany pulled ahead in the first game to win l5-Jl. uni(Jn then got psyched and kicked Albany 15-3. Both teams played well in the third .game,, but Union played better as the team.took the third game af the match 15-1 o, Amy Juchatz and Linda Sctivani had g9od !!piking, and .Diana Gazzolo, Liz Yager, ancl Cathy Reals all served well. Because of this win, Union pulled their record up to a satisfactory 4--3. Union was supposed to play Williams College at Union on Nov. 4, but the game was called . off when Williams arrived a day early. The game will be rescheduled, and Union is determined to win. Saturday, Nov, 8, Union was in a district tournament at Albany Jr. College with five other teams; Kings College, SUC .at New Paltz, SUC at Oneonta, Russell Sage College, and Siena. It was a disappointing day for l:Jnion, as she lost her first and second matches. The women played against a surprising New Paltz team who won the match in two games. Union then went on to play rival Russell Sage and almost won, but suffered a tough loss instead. Russell Sage won the first game easily, as Union rallied too late. In the second game, Union bounced bact<: to win 15-1. Russell Sage gained control again in the third game and won the match, continuing play in the tournament.

Credit: Tom Welles luggers Victorious Once Agaiu The Union Ruggers ended their regular season last Saturday, downing Hartwick 38-0 in what turned out to be more of a scrimmage than a match for the B team. Hartwick, a new team, was unversed in many of the rules and procedures of the game and much titne was spent helping them out - something the Union team was glad to do in the gentlemanly spirit of the gatne. As a match, the game lacked excitement in spite of the high score. The score, 38-0, would be indicative of a cra~ed coach intent on rolling up the score in any other game; but in rugby, where the statistics. of a second. team are illegal, the high score reflects nothing more t.han th~ required hard play. of a more experienced group of men. Briefly, the scoring went as follows: there were six tries scored, setting a new team record, by Peter Parisi, Tom ~yan, Bill Glavin, John Andrews, Steve, Robey, and on·e shared (intentionally~ by Chris Taylor and Tom Ryan. The conversion kicks of four of the tries were successful, all of these being made SX Bill r-ellows, making him the stngle htgh scor~r of the season. The remaining 6 points were made by Jim Stants in a field goal attempt, and by Chris Taylor in a dynamic drop kick during the play of the game - a first for Union College.

Page 12 CONCORDIENSIS, Wednesday. Nov. 12, 1975 ·- Senior co·c~ptian John Denio beating an opponent out for the ball. Paathers Skin Garnet by CHARLES FLANAGAN and HAN~ HEALY Saturday's long bus trip to Middlebury proved fruitless for the Union football team as they were beaten by Middlebury. 47- 15. Fundamental mistakes along with the failure to stop Middlebury's two sophomore backs were the reasons cited for Union's lopsided loss. After watching the Garnet II miss tackles. have a punt blocked, and fumble twice, Coach Cahill said he \couldn't believe it. We drill on fundamentals for twelve weeks and suddenly we play like we've never heard of them.\ One of the problems that Union couldn't seem to solve was the running of the two sopho- more halfbacks, Roy Heffernan and John Dobek. Heffernan ran through and around the porous Union defense for 166 yards in just seven carries, while Dobek netted 116 yards in eight carries. The sum total for just these two comes out to be a big 282 yards on the ground on fourteen carries. averaging 20.14 yards per carry. Both backs scored two touchdowns a piece. Union was preparing for these two runners the entire week, but something went wrong. \They have good backs, we knew that,\ Cahill admitted ... We also thought we could stop them. They didn't show us anything ..on ·offense that we weren't prepared for. But oh. those arm tackles. Those backs both have good strength and balance. You can't arm tackle people like that, you've got to put them down.\ Union's offense started off on the wrong foot when their first drive was stopped by a fumble. Middlebury's halfback John Dobek turned the mistake into a six point score with a 24 yard run. Theensuingkickoff led to a repeat of the first. Once again, the Union drive was halted by a fumble which led to another score by Middlebury. Jhis time Ron Chase added the points on a five yard nm. Middlebury scored once more before Union reached the score board. It was a five yard pass ·from QB Jack Leary to Collamore that accounted for MiddlebJ.lry's third TD. Six minutes later, Union's Marty Cohn drove over from the one yard line to give Union its first of its two touchdowns. The scoring was not over for the first half. Two more scores came from the two sophomores. Heffernan and Dobek, 52 and 73 yard runs respectively, making the score 34- 6 at the half. . The second half started out on a better note when Tom Hood blocked a punt which was unfortunately recovered by the kicker in the endz.one giving Union only 2 points for the safety. Six minutes later QB Andy Terranova (replacing an injured Mark Broomfield) dove over the goal line. Middlebury's Heffernan once again broke into the clear and ran 50 yards, breaking five arm ta c k I e s f o r t h e s c o r e. Middlebury's seventh and final score of the game came at the end of the third period on Leary's 17 yard run. The fourth quarter was scoreless for both teams due to the monsoon-like weather which postponed play for a short time and left the field in an extremely muddy condition. Some interesting stattsttcs resulted from the game. While Middlebury racked up 13 first downs, Union trailed by only one, tallying 12. Middlebury's 144 yards in penalties against them well exceeded Union's 56 yards. But it was the rushing yardage that was the most outstanding.

In this annual event. Union has been named top seed and will play host t:o three other upstate squads. The . bids. which were released this Monday; includ.e the University of Rochester {8-.6). vanquished earlier in the season by the Dutchmen 3-0. SUNY Tennis by ELLEN UCHTIG and JOANNE MUTHER Union, despite their final anc.i crucial match against Rus~ell Sage, added two more wins to their record, culminating in a conclusive and overall season of four wins and five losses. The home match against Skidmore proved. to represent more than. a close battle for it was this contest which epitomized the value of experience. This time, the Union girls were confident and playing up to their potential, without the extreme cautiousne$s which often restricts good play. Leslie Kent, Ellen Lichtig and Barb Berk all carried off victories, whereas the first and second doubles teams, though bowing to their opponents, could both. report some excellent matches. Their scores .of 6-4, 6-4 and 2-6~ 6- 4, 5-7, respectively, are convincing support. Roberta Topolsky, the third singles player also dropped her match to Skidmore while Denise Wachtenheini came through with one of the longest (proof of this was the use of the night lights) and most tenaciously fought competitions, winning 6-7, 6-3, 6-2. Union deserved their 4-3 team victory. On the 23rd of October, Union travelled to Cobleskill to play their second-to-last match. Both singles and doubles players came out on top, revealing consistently fine scores. Overall, this match was relatively easier than any previous competition. ihe closing match was against Russell Sage and played here at Union on the coldest day of the season. Leslie Kent was Union's lone single~; victor, prevailing in straight sets, while Sam Goldin and Joanne Muther teamed to post a 3-set triumph in doubles. Lee Russell and Anne Bahlman insisted on a 3-set contest under the lights but, like other tie- breakers and 3-set matches of the day, did not quite mastet: their opponents. Nevertheless, from an overall perspective;. a final competition is n o t a I ways t h e m o s t representative and if one views ihe team's season in totality, he would find that their success could not have been any more evident. Many thanks to out coach, Sandy, a.nd for a. well- organized and busy schedule. Plattsburgh and St. Lawrence, both with identical 8-5-l records, round out the field. The tourney starts this Friday, the 14th, with Plattsburgh and Rochester squaring off in the first round ·game at noon.

In a hotly contested battle between two other qualified candidates, Leonard and Bill gained the two top positions, The role of the co-chairman is a very demanding one. It seems that whenever . matters concerning Black students at Union College come about, the two co- chairmen's opinions and ideas are sought. But how do Leonard and Bill perceive their roles as the leaders of the Alliance? · Leonard: My role as a B.S.A. co-chairman is to assist my fellow co-chairman in making valid and adequate decisions towards the whole of the Black Student Alliance. It is my function to ably represent aU .ideological segments of the Alliance, even if they don't coincide with my own views. Bill: I feel that the role of the co-chairman is to lead the B.S.A. towaros definite goals. These goals include unification among all Black students on campus, the participation of all segments of the campus in Alliance-related activities, but foremost to establish some type of culturai identification and satisfaction for Blacks at Union College. Since Bitt is beginning his second year at the helm of the Alliance; he was asked if his job appeared t.o be different. , . • .. ' Bili: As far as.m:Y duties ar¢ concerned, no. However, I feel -that people are beginning to look towards me more due to my experience. and because some people have just become accustomed to seeing me at the job. In recent weeks. B.S.A. members have become aroused at the drastic budget cuts at the hands of the trail Committee. The co-chairmen responded by saying .. Leonard:. In my opinion, the recent cuts could .prove to be an asset in the functioning of the B.S.A. People are beginning to realize what lirnits and controls Union College has placed on our organization. This realization could possibly encourage people to try and reverse this situation. Financially. we may not be able to enjoy some of the things that we've had in the past, but these sacrifices can definitely make us a stronger organism. Bill: I-t is a well-known fact that the Black Student Alliance's budget took a sizeable cut. The Tax and Auditing Committee informed the Steering Committee of the Alliance that all organizations on campus are going to l'eceive some type of monetary cutback. I think the recent budget .cuts considerably hurt the B. S.A., but the members of the organization are going to have to work even harder to accomplish our preconceived goals. .Rumors abound around the B.S.A. that upperclassmen are trying to shove the Alliance down the throats of the underclassmen. Leonard responded to this statement by saying, \I do not think that thls is the case. Maybe the methods that upperclassme11 use to orientate the under- classmen to the situation at Union are being misunder.stood. It is our duty, as the upperclassmen to poilU out the benefits that an organization such as the Alliance can provide. However, it is their duty. to become aware of the 'situation on campus'.\ Administrators and some faculty members are apparently elated over the lessening of racial prol>lems on campus (what are they seeing that I'm not!), so Perspective sought the opinion of one of the co-£hairman on the lessening of Black problems on campus . Bill: I don't think that the problems of Black students have lessened to any extent. What I think has happened is the awareness of the problems of Black students at Union has increased. (There is a difference.) Although both co-chairmen have very distinct personalities, their working relationship appears to be going along very smoothly, as· pointed out by the goals they have set up for the Black Student Alliance this year, and in the coming years. These plans include: 1.) Alliance involvement in Union College policy-making 2.) Alliance involvement with other minority organizations in the tr.i-city area 3.) More involvement with the community 4,) 'Increased interaction with Black faculty and administrators I have known these two young men for approximately three years, and I definitely have faith in their abilities to achieve any goal they set their minds on. And with their intelligence, good looks, and me as their friend, what can't they accomplish? mvb All people who are in desperate need of . a loan, conta.et either Robert McClennon or Robert Wilson.

'I,he Day Care Dilemma For many people in the United States, low-cost day care· is the key to survival. Its absence can mean and does mean the difference between going on or not going on welfare. Drastic and ruthless federal cutbacks in social service spending have brought untold hardships to thousands of working parents who desparately depend on child care facilities. Case in point, the Department of Labor's Bureau Statistics cite a figure of over 33.5 million women employed in late 1974 - an increase of a million over a ten year period. This statistic alone should deem it necessary to implement more reasonably- priced, quality day care centers. However, this fact was not so obvious to fOPmer president Nixon. In 1971, Nixon vetoed an Office of Economic Opportunity ( 0 E 0 ) bill containing a comprehensive $2.1 billion child- development program that would have somewhat alleviated many of the day care's money problems, and would have made more day care available. His warped reasoning; The section showed \fiscal irresponsibility, adminis- trative unworkability, and family- weakening implications.\ In 1972, the federal government added the icing to the cake by imposing a $2.5 billion national spending ceiling for social services and pointedly excluded child care from the Federal Revenue Sharing Bill. As a result, day care is forced to compete not only with other social services such as those for the elderly, the blind and disabled, but also with the fire, police, and sanitation. departments for its share of the cake; Especially hard hit by fhis legislation, or lack of it, are urban Black families,.. living in such areas as the Watts and Filmore Districts where intended-family child rearing no longer exists; where women work whether they are heads ·Of households or not, and where all too many children start off life in a sea of economic, emotional, and educational deprivation. Jn Part 2 of this article, which will appear in the next issue of .Perspective, we will examine how the realities of the day care situation are being dealt with. This article will examine the situation in three cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit. While each city has its own specific day ~are problems, three main concerns - money, facilities, and quality - reflect a common situation found in many cities. Dear Sisterly Love Dear Sisterly Love, I know this isn't any of my business, but it has been on my mind for the past some-odd weeks. To put it very bluntly, I am very sensitive to odors and there is this one particular person that I know that has an odor problem. I like the person and everything, but everytime that person comes by I just shy away.· Lord knows where it's coming from, but it's coming. I want to tell this person, but I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings - what 'cha say? Dear Friend, Signed, Just a friend don't know a damn thmg about and how to stop it.

Of course. the shit is absurd, and I'll be damned if I know who has this brllliant imagination (though I have a good idea). lfs like this: sotne people just ain't got maturity so they sit around and speculate on anything they see, then they tell someone, who tells someone else, and so on. You can•t stop it, so the best thing to do is deal with it. Let people know that what you do ain't none of their business, and be nasty about it if necessary. If you got to be that way, you gots to be that way - ooh well, that's life. (I befcha it will give them something real to talk about th~n!) ~·. During 'lunch, I thought I'd amu~e myself by watching the great American pasttime, T.V. Bill Elliot, a Black, commented that Bla<;:k Americans should honor the ·bicentennial since it is celebrating the present and not the past. He said (and I .quote) \If this was one hundred yea-rs ago, I wouldn't ·be on national TV.'; My immediate comment was, \Bum•· It seems as though e:very time Blacks · make some accomplishments a lot of people feel that we should thank someone. To me, it looks this way. I demand freedom. lf Whitey decides to let me have $50,000 a year and puts me on national TV; should 1 thank him? Consider an analogy, Now, if, instead of my freedom being stolen,. my wa;Uet was. In my wallet was two million dollars. Now if the thief was nice enough to give me $50,000 of what was rightfully mine in the first place, should I thank him? Of course not. A hundred years ago. if TV was around, it would have been the right of my Black ancestors to be on it. And I will not thank the White: thieves or their descendants for allowing me some of my rights now. The reason I got so upset about Mr. Elliot's comment, is becatlse I am guilty of simi~ar Bull -. l have heard some af my 'friends~ use the word Nigger in my presence. They were trying to be funny (l think.). but wl}at they don't realize is that as long as it is ·funny, then it should not be used. I am guilty because I laughed {l think it's called Tomin~) instead of saying ~omething. The problem is that prejudice is. not as noticeable as it once was. And a lot of peeple feel that it has di~appeared just 'cause they can't see it. This· is compounded by Blacks who don't discuss such. things for fear of starting something. They started it, let them know where you !!land.

Bil'l Elliot, a Black, commented that Black Americans should horwr the bicentennial since it is celebrating the present and not the past. He said (and I quote) \If this was one hundred years ago, I wouldn't be on national TV.\ My immediate comment was, \Bull!\ The reason I got so upset about Mr. Elliot's comment, is becal!lse I am guilty of similar Bull -. I have heard some of my 'friends' use the word Nigger in my presence. They were trying to be fwnny (I ·think,) but what they don't realize is that as long as it is funny, then it should not be used. I am guilty because I laughed (I think it's called Ton1in') instead of saying something. The problem is that prejudice is not as noticeable as it once was. And a lot of people feel that it has disappeared just 'cause they can't see it. This is compounded by Blacks who don't discuss such things for fear of starting something. They started it, let them know where you stand. If I thank anyone it will be my Black ancestors. They sweated, and fought, and bled, and died for me to allow m.e the right to be where I am now. I do not thank America for indeed it was America who stole my .rights in the first place. ~ Ana Logy ~ ~ ~' ~ Special Thanks To .............. $2.50 specials and t.w.i.g.s. ~ ·~ ~ ~1\'..-'1\'1\'1\:.1. ,..... ....,. ....... \\\\'~ rl'he Day Care Dilemma for many people in the United States, low-cost day care is the key to survival. Its absence can mean and does mean the difference between going on or not going on welfare. Drastic and ruthless federal cutbacks in social service spending have brought untold hardships to thousands of working parents who desparately depend on child care facilities. Case in point, the Department of Labor's Bureau Statistics cite a figure of over 33.5 million women employed in late 1974 - an increase of a million over a ten year period. This statistic alone should deem it necessary to implement more reasonably- priced, quality day care centers. However, this fact was not so obvious to f01\lller president Nixon. In 1971, Nixon vetoed an Office uf Economic Opportunity ( 0 E 0) bill containing a comprehensive $2.1 billion child- development program that would have somewhat alleviated many of the day care's money problems, and would have made more day care available. His warped reasoning; The section showed \fiscal irresponsibility, adminis- trative unworkability, and family- weakening implications.\ In 1972, the federal government added the icing to the cake by imposing a $2.5 billion national spending ceiling for social services and pointedly excluded child care from the Federal Revenue Sharing Bill. As a result, day care is forced to compete not only with other social services such as those for the elderly, the blind and disabled, but also with the fire, p o I i c e , a n d s a n i t a t i o n. departments for its share of the cake. Especially hard hit by this legislation, or lack of it, are urban Black families, living in such areas as the Watts and Filmore Districts where intended-family child rearing no longer exists; where women work whether they are heads of households or not, and where all too many children start off life in a sea of economic, emotional, and educational deprivation. In Part 2 of this article, which will appear in the next issue of .Perspective, we will examine how the realities of the day care situation are being dealt with. This article will examine the situation m three cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit. While each city has its own specific day care problems, three main concerns money, facilities, and qua~y reflect a common situation found in many cities. Dear Sisterly Love Dear Sisterly Love, I know this isn't any of my business, but it has been on my mind for the past some-odd weeks. To put it very bluntly, l am very sensitive to odors and there is this one particular person that l know that has an odor problem. I like the person and everything, but everytime that person comes by I just shy away. Lord knows where it's coming from, but it's coming. I want to tell this person, but I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings - what 'cha say? Dear Friend, Signed, Just a friend So you want to put your misery to end? If you really want to help your friend just tell that person that they have an odor problem. If you can't do that tell them that you don't dig the cologne or perfume they have been wearing. Suggest Ban or Right Guard. If dragon breath is their problem, just before they open their mouth, pop a Certs or down some Listerine. If it is below the waist odor, suggest that they cross their legs and visit their shower as often as possible. Or slip a pamphlet about proper hygiene underneath their door.

It's like this: some people just ain't got maturity so they sit around and speculate on anything they see, then they tell someone, who tells someone else, and so on. You can't stop it, so the best thing to do is deal with it. Let people know that what you do ain't none of their business, and be nasty about it if necessary. If you got to be that way, you gots to be that way - ooh well, that's life. (I bet'cha it will give them something real to talk about then!) Dear Sisterly Love, I'm a sister who is tired of the way some of these dudes act around here. I'm tired of the bootie-bandits, the vampires and the night stalkers.

What I want to know IS why people got to lie about t~i';lgs _th~y Si,gned, Ain't No Tree It seems as though every time Blacks make some accomplishments a lot of people feel that we should thank someone. To me, it looks this way. I demand freedom. If Whitey decides to let me have $50,000 a year and puts me on national TV; should I thank him? Consider an analogy. Now, if, instead of my freedom being stolen, my wallet was. In my wallet was two million dollars. Now if the thief was nice enough to give me $50,000 of what was rightfully mine in the first place, should I thank him? Of course not. A hundred years ago if TV was around, it would have been the right of my Black ancestors to be on it. And I will not thank the The White race has looked and said, \Look at what advances the Blacks have made.\ I believe they used the same reasoning to salve their conscience when they were gracious enough to 'give' the Indians reservations to live on. They feel that if they tell their Until I have the right to a good education (even if I live in Boston) and all the things which Whitey's kids already have guaranteed them, I will not be pacified, thankfml for what I've got. As long as Whitey has us thankful for what we've got, he's going to keep what's rightful'ly ours. - Bradley E. Ransom Attiea Did You Know?.er Continued from Page A prosecute only prisoners. The indictments should not stop with the lowly gunmen who have always been expendable in the eyes of the state. The indictments should reach to the highest levels - up to and including chief prosecutor Anthony Simonetti and former governor Nelson Rockefeller. Rockefeller's successor, Hugh Carey, is the man who must make the final decisions on Attica. He has recently modified his position, admitting that the courts might not be able to handle the problem and that some form of amnesty might be necessary. But Carey is avoiding the real issue, and it is clear that he lacks the courage to act decisively. As stated earlier, Carey admits that some form of amnesty might be necessary, but he denies that he has the power to grant it. He claims that it is up to the legislature and tries to pass the buck there. But in 1971, Nelson Rockefeller created the Attica prosecution overnight by executive action, and Carey has the legal power as governor to end it exactly the same way. There is no need for a long legal debate. If and when Carey sees the need, he can end the Attica ·massacre with a stroke of the pen. Courtesy of the Attica Press Release These Musical Firsts?

The seating capacity is 3,000 persons. Approximately 1,400 seats are set aside for students, faculty, and .staff members. Students desiring to receive free tickets for a game must pick up their t~ckets in advance at the rink. ID cards must be shown and· ihe tickets must be picked up on specific dates. The reason for this procedure is so that leftover tickets can be sold to the public. The student tickets are for specific seats, so students should buy their tickets together if they plan to sit together. The advantage ·of having reserved seats is that students Won't have to go to the games early and wait in line. Tb,e seats reserved for students are on the East side (Lenox Road side) of the rink, b~hind the players' boxes. There will be a special entrance for students, faculty, and staff on the soccer field side of the rink. Another source of revenue for the facility is the renting of ·ice time to outside groups. Some of the groups currently using the rink for their practices are the Schenectady Youth Hockey Association, the Mohawk Valley Skating Club, and the Senior Men's Hockey League.

Naturally I have been working hard all the. time and. I won't have to drop courses like I did last time. The· N-ott Memorial fell d6wn· a little bit. But we got a new ice rink to skate in and see hockey g~mes. Sometimes I get locked our of my dormitory but I can get in through the lounge window. I a.sked the direct.()r of security why the doors were locked and he said that if a thief wanted to get in, he'd get in anyway. Honest, Mom. The publisher of Screw Magazine spoke one day. I was going to see him but I decided to stay home and' read the stuff under the couch. It was all the same anyway. One day there was a new strip of blacktop in Mrs. Perkin's Garden. No one knew what it was for unless it was to keep the Rathskeller from flooding and it kept flooding anyway. Mrs. Marra got a nice new office in Carnegie, so now I can visit her without worrying that the Dean of Students will see me and tell me what I ought to . be doing. We used to go to West for Sunday breakfast. One day my friend found a ten-microfarad capacitor in his scrambled eggs. We don't go any more. I was in lab the other day. Som~body told me I had stolen their condenser. I held it up to show him it was mine. He tried to grab it out of my hand but it got thrown into a hood and got smashed all over a Florence flask. He found his condenser in a cabinet later. ' I went to a concert one night. I felt beer· dripping on me from the balcony. I guessed right and managed to avoid the Heineken bottle by a few inches. It dented the bench, though. Actually, I guess it was a good term. I worked a lot. Mostly there was nothing else to do. But I liked to watch the soccer team. They play real well and most of them are good sports. They won almost every game, and they did it all by themselves. I'll be home early for Thank$giving, f guess. PGS very ..( di,sturbed To the Editor: . I am very disturbed at · information that has reached me recently. I have heard that the · I Student Government is cutting off funds and possibly revoking the charters for all ·~religious\ organizations. This is very Wrong. .First, .. religious'' organizations provi<l~ . an opportunity for learniQg about and discussing the · concepts on whib the ,religions are I based. Union is sad•y lacking Profs., and therefore courses, in this area. Without a doubt the Bible is the most famous literary and historic work ever written. It has revolutioni~-ed society. ' . Next l'm sure that these recent , attempts to cut off religion and I the availability of teaching it wm not truly do a thorough job. To do so they would have to, wipe out the Philosophy, Biology and Psychology departments to -begin ·1 with tlten many othef courses and Profs. around the campus. A journal thai 1 ttirned i11 to a supposedly scholarly Prof. was sent back with the following comment .. Ood talking to man is hallucination. •• There was no proof, no evidence at all to support his statement. All his Psychological theories rest on this assumption as does all Modern Philosophy and Evolutionary Biotogy. They are all 'religions! Such agnostic thinking cannot be considered objective rea!loning, science, or true scholarship, ln the end it comes down to this: there can't be God because there can•t be God. (How is that for logic?} The same beliefs are held by many Profs. throughout Union. · ·eaching is baseq on this ~ ssumption almost without u.ception. This is religion just as nuch as when U.nion~s Ghristian I -'ellowship or Hillel teaches, }•reaches, and worships God. H ntil Profs. drop this assu~ption c: r prove it one can not eliminate r~ligion from Union by simply cutting off U.C.F. and Hillel. Love in Jesus Chti,st -my Lord, Woody Lauer '76 sos- Editors, Concordiensis: - I don't know who is responsible for the advertisement in last week's Concordiensis' regardirtg work abroad sponsored by a company 43alled S.OtS.; but I would like to register a word of warning. In the spring of 1974, a . friend and I both applied to ~.O.S. fot jobs for Wi!lter term of ·1975. As we were bot,h planning Bn .studying in Europe i11 th~. fall, . we decided to take winter ter'm off to remain in Europe , and ·work. We applied through S.O.S. a.nd before we left for Europe in the fall, Were assured by a contract with S.O.S. that we h.ad jobs in Switzerland to begin in January. In· addition to this, we paid a rather large amount of· money for a week's orientation in Luxembourg preceeding our scheduled employment. In October •75, while in Italy, I received a letter from S.O.S. stating that our plans were to be delayed for several weeks. The next correspondence I had Was that I had no job at all until April and was that all right? Well, the re!lsons they gave for this re- scheduling were rather unsubstanti~l and insincei 1 e; in my opinien. They blamed the delay ·on problems with the recent ·.refefendum in Switzerland wh.ich, · 'first of all, nevef passed. secondly, was more directly aitned · at , ltlJr~pean rather than American .. wo.-kers in the country, and thirdly, if they had sec11red out jobs the previous May ·when we first applied (as they bad led us to believe they 'did) I don't think there would have been any pro!>lem.

As a result, the Continued on Page 4 ·hooray Infirmary Oear Editor: During my entire Freshman' year here at Union, I heard nothing but bad reports about the infirmary~ The most common were: \They don't know anything over there, They don't do anything for you. If you're sick, don't go to the infirmary!\ I never had occasion, however, to find out how much truth there was behind these rumors. My entire experience with the infirmary consisted of one flu shot (it was painless - 2 points for the infirmary) 1,1nd a visit when I had bronchitis. the · doctor seemed competent, I was given medicine, and shortly afterwards my bronchitis·. was gone. This year 1 had the surprise 'or discovering that everything rd , been heating about the horrors of falling sick and ending up in the infirmary was not nec~ssarily true. I did not enjoy being ,sick, but I have no complaints a'bout my stay in the infirmary. The nurses knew what they were doing; they were concerned without being over-solicitous, and they were friendly and cheerful as well. The doctors did whatever was necessary and they answered all the questions that l as,ked. The food was all right, there was a television, it was quiet when l wanted to sleep·, and they allowed visitors in with no trouble. What more could I have asked for? you've · heard; then give it a chance. Don't go around saying that Union has a lousy infirmary unless .you're b~sing your claim on exp(!rience. Sincerely, Alison Jameson Class of 1978 Brownlee Editor.. Conecirdlensis: ln the November l2issue of.the Coneordi~mSis, John Sh~ret (sic) wr(;)te a cover !ftoey on Dr. Paula B.-owntee·~ possible appointment as Dean of the Fa~ulty. In that article, Mr. Sherer (sic) implied that Dr, IJonner~s decision to offer this positic;m to .Ot. :Brownlee was partly in response to pressure from the President's · Comm~si;ion on the St~tus. <>f Women. This implication . i~ · not only incorrect; no member of the Corthnission; nor the Commission as a whole has ever approached President Bonnet· on this. matter; · but it is . also a dangerous suggestion that the decision to hire Dr, .Brownlee was made not on the basis of her excellent eredenti~ls but simply because she~s a woman . We would suggest strongly that Mr. Sherer (sic) issue a retraction of these obvious distortions. ·and send letters of apology to President Bonner .and Dr. Brownlee aa .well as to the _P~side_nt:~~ .c~m~mission on the Status of'Women. . · President•s Commission on the Status of Women Ed. Note: • . Just a few comments . in response to this Jetter. First, the story did not ·imply that the President's decision to offer this position to Dr. Brownlee Was \partly in response to pressures\ from the President's Commission on the Status of Women. It merely stated - and you have denied ~ that such pressures exist. Indeed there are many groups and individuals on this campus, with perhaps more influence than the Women's Commission, who make suggestions and recommendations which are not accepted by the Administration in the decision- making process. It is false to assume that because a given pressure is exerted, a· decision is. ipso facto made ' 1 in response'' to it. . Second, up on close examination, you will find that it was never suggested that the President's decision to offer l)r, Brownlee the position was made on the basis of sex. In fact, the story quotes a source as saying that Dr. Bonner \would be delighted with a Woman of her qualifications and capabilities,\ ~ot that he is delighted -because she is a woman. There is no reason to print a retraction since the \obvious distortions\ to which you refer simply do not exist in the story. We thank the Commission for their concern artd hope that in the future they continue to consult the President on matters of great importance to the College. ·JMS I think the infirmary is just one of those institutitions that everyone complains about, whether they have reason to or not. As a result, students who have never been in there have a negative attitude about it that's not necessary. lf you've had a bad experience with the infirmary, that's one tqing, but if you haven't, and everything you know about the itifir.macy ·is,.wbatever . .. . . . sorry JOnesy - Editor, Concordiensis: On October 29, ·union's cross~ country co-captain Steve Jones ~ broke the College's course r¢cotd in .a dual meet against Williams. Concordiensis did not report this, so I am taking this opportunity to inform the Colle~e community. ~~~!i_nued on Page 4 • •·

Well, starting Winter term; Union will offer an opport11nity to interested students to conquer public speaking. A Speech Club is now being formed. The purposes behind such a club are: (I) to offer opportunities in extemporaneous speeches, panel discussion, debates, argumentative and persuasive techniques, and general hints on pubJic speaking, and (2) to offer a medium where students of differing disciplines {i.e. liberal JEAN LUC GODARD'S \LA CHINOISE tt DOUBLE FEATURE Rov. 19-25 · .\La Chmois\ ..-.. 7:30. \Weekend\ -- 9:05 ., Students with J.D. $1.50 · Mon.-Thtiri -WI AJi, Theater, Rtes 5 &. sO Scotia 346-4960 arts and science) c1;1n exchange ideas, opinions, and knowledge on an informal, yet constructive basis. Right now, the .club is in the final planning stages. However, it is necessary to have student .input and cooperation in implementing the final plan. Therefore, a meeting has been . scheduled for Thursday (tomorrow), Nov. 20th at 4 p.m. in Strauss Lounge. Anyone interested in this venture, please attend. If you cannot tnake the meeting, but .weuld like tQ make suggestions, contact Diana Leyden at 370-6638 or Bo.Jt 2129. Hopefully, as a result of this club, · a spring course (evening division) will be offered in public speaking. Eventually a comp. ed. course will be offered. Please show your interest.

First of all, the format of Linebacker, starting with this week's issue, has been drastically changed. We have restored the practice of pr:irtting th~ responses to all questions asked. However, to offset the costs of more copy, we have decided to distribute four copies to each RA and fraternity president. In addition, we. have printed the departmental and college-wide ranges fot each question.

He founded it to give young musicians in the area the experience of playing in a fun symphonic orchestra, something that no single high school - Qr Union College - could provide ahme. Jn addition to conducting NENYYO, which he took on in 1973 when Prof. Curtis had to step down for health reasons, Prof. Waters composes and teaches composition, twentieth century music literature, a~ ' electronic music. He is a member of the Albany Symphony and Musica Viva, a contemporary music group in the area which formed last year. One of Prof. Waters' recent works, ••Namarie!\ Galadriel's Lament in Lorein,\ was. performed by Musi~ Viva on Nov. 16 at the Institute of History an(t Art in Albany.

Professor Berk speaking in 016 More Rallies by BARBARA ROSLYN A rally was held at Union College on November 17 in response to the United Nations resolution passed on Monday, November 10. by the General Assembly which equates Zionism with racism. SSO I 6 was filled to capacity and there was not enough room for all those who turned out to hear the various speakers. President Thomas Bonner, Professor Charles Gati of the Political Science Department, Professor Stephen Berk of the History Department, and students Julie Epstein, Robert Kaslovsky, and Stephen Wenig spoke on the issue. The rally was intended to inform the students of what had occurred, the vanous ramifications of this resolution, what Zionism is, and what possible actions can be taken in response to the resolution. The students had gathered together to demonstrate their solidarity in backing Israel and the U.S. government in rejecting such an action by the General Assembly. Those in attendance were reminded by the speakers of the event which took place on Nov. 9, 1939 in Germany. Kristallnacht (Night of the Crystal Glass) was the beginning of the infamous Holocaust which left 6 million Jewish men, women and children dead. The rally was organized by a group of Jewish students who are concerned with events affecting Jews throughout the world as well as here at Union f'nJlpop (· l_J ....--------------- ..... 4~t~ Fight Default. r ~ j ~ )t~, ' ; NOT FOR THE Drop the B-1 Bomber! While President Ford is ~ay ing !\'0 to KY. City, a very important cause of this crisis is being over-looked. According to Professor Seymour Melman of Columbia Vniversitv. author of The Permanent War Ecunomy; ''The Federal Government rompounds the damage to the New York Cities of this country by preempting the cities' tax bases \hile lavishing our tax dollars on foreign power plays and military adventures.\ lle further explains that Washingtun .. has been milking the economy or N. Y. State\ by transferring rnpital and purchasing power to a minority of states with higher concentrations of military industry and bases. W p're also informed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Office of Economic Adjustment that investments in civilian jobs, dollar for \,!}lar, provides up to twice the e\ 1loyment gained through militar~ contracts. Yt:>t as we face ri8in~r unemployment and inflation. the military budget is S('fting an all timr war OR peace-time high. Within this budget may be the beginning of the most expensive weapon ever propoged. It is the B-1 strategic bom~r and will eost tax payers an l'stimated $75 BILLION ov~r th~ next decade or $375 for eaeh Ameriran. And it will be OBSOLETE lwfore it is completed! It is still early eno1.1gh to stop the B·l and take a stand for new national priorities to meet h·uman needs. Congress will \ote on B-1 product ion in mid-1976. With ~our ~upport the SST and ABM were halted: but positive alternatives were lacking. We're proposing peace conversion of our economy as the alternative to the B-1. Peace conversion can help us meet the transportation, housing, medical, urban and environmental needs of our society while also providing us with a foreign policy that doesn't isolate us from the rest of the world. The B-1 bomber can only serve to: 1) Escalate the nuclear arms race. 2) Pollute the upper atmosphere like the SST. 1) Make future Vil't !\'am wars more likely. 4) Enrich corporate fat cats. Peaee Conversion doesn't mean dosing down the Water,·liet Arsenal or KAPL but rather opening it up to meet the needs of people both in products and more jobs.

Photo by - · Les Trachtman Hockey Returns to Union After an ;tbsence of 25 years, inte.-ct>llegiate hockey at Union Ccllege will again be on the ice to compete in. the 1975-76 season, utilizing the new Achilles Rink as its home, Under the direction of Head · Coach Ned Harkness, the te~m. consisting of all freshmen, will be competing in ECAC Division U. In its inaugural season, the newest ' Dutchmen varsity faces a difficult schedule of 24 games including 15 at· home against top flight competition from U.s. and Canadian colleges. Highlighting the season is the Merrimack Tournament ~nd individual match-ups with .rivalS Hamiltort and Middlebury ..... . To meet this challenging sch~iiule, Coach· Harkness · .. has recruited a t~lented group of players from. across the country to lead Union in its first season, As impressive as their credentials are, it is still a long road ahead. However, as Harkness has stated, \We are going to be very, very competitive in our di¥isi<m.\ Backing up this belief was the recent rating of Union as ninth in Division 11 in one pre-season coaches poll. Wftatever the team may be lacking in age, exp.erience, and maturity, they will almost certainly make up for with skill, toughness, and desire - a trademark .of Harkness t~tns of the past. These qualitms are perhaps best typified by the team Tri-Captains: Kip Churchill, Jack Rankin, and Mario Giallonardo. Kip. a skillful and \Crafty center; will lead the offense while stalwarts Jack and Mario will anchor the Dutchmen defense. The Varsity is made up of 22 players and appear·s well balanced at all positions, but particularly up the middle at the center slot where the team can boast of four promising prospects. Leading the way is Kip Churchill (5-ll •. 170 pounds. Rexdale, Ontario),. along with Denis \Skeeter\ Gaz;.::ola (6- 2, 21'0 pc;mnds. Thorold, Ontario), · Don Marshall (5-8, 160 pounds. Hull, Massachusetts), and Kevin· Kardo~ (S-9. 155 pounds. l,;ivon,ia, Michigan). · At .the wing position, the Dutchmen are well endowed with nine strong ·and aggressive skaters headed up by Grant Judd (5-10, 170 pounds. Trenton, ~ic~igan), and Brad Hinterbergef(S:.t (, 180 pounds. Bbffalo, New York). Providing 'further depth at the wing are Mark Jenkins (5,.11, 170 pounds. Billerica, Massachusetts), Mike O'Conneli(S.;S, 165 pounds. Lynn, Massachusetts), Tom ··-Pahapill (5-11, 1&0 pounds. Weston, Ontario), Steven Sisler (5·8, 150 pounds. Ithaca, New · York), Brian Bagley (S-7, 180 pounds.. Holbrook, Mass- achusetts), John Wright (S-8, 150 pounds. Port Huron, Michigan), . and Lou Thomann (5-10, 173 pounds. Littleton, Colorado}. Backfngup the defense will be six sturdy defensemen who may be the real strenith of the team this year. Providing the power will be Jack R11nkin (5-10; 190 pounds. Dearborn, Michigan) and Mario Giallonardo (5-11, 201 pounds. Toronto, Ontario). Assisting them are Dean • Mathewson (5-11, l65 pounds. Williamsville, New York)~ Mark Schmalz (6-0, 194 pounds. Mississauga, Ontario), Berhard Kaminski (6-2, 185 - pounds. Scarboro, Ontario), and Peter Hamilton (6~3, 180 pounds. Natick, Massachusetts). The 6ack9one of any team is a capable contingent of goal tenders. This year's squad possesses tlll'e~ fine ones in Jim Baxter (5-1'0, 160 pounds. West Hill,. Ontario), Steven Baker (6-3, 200 pounds. Braintree, Mas~achusetts), a·nd Dave Schm~rtz (5-.11, 170 pot!nds. River.dale, New Y Qrk). \ Putting it a:U together, the Union College Hockey Team emulates the exciting and determined squads that ha:ve been so ,..indicative of Harkness' coaching down througb~the years.

Page 12 CONCORDIENSIS. Wednesday, Nov. 19. 19.75 Soccer Wins ECAC~s; Best Season Ever.·· ~- ~ I • ' -· • by JOHN BUSTERUD The Dutc;hmen hooters capped off their best season ever this past weekend rolling easily over the field of cballengc;:rs in the ECAC upstate soccer - tournament. By beating St. Lawrence 4-2 ori Friday and rating Plattsb\ugh State 8-0 in the finals, the Garnet captured their first ECAC laurels and fini~hed with the best record ( 12-2) compiled by a Union College soccer team. Among the records set by this prolific squad were most. wins-12, longest win streak, most goals-54 (for a fantastic 3.93 goals per game), and most shut-outs-5. Individually, Craig Jeffries set the all-time career and season scoring records netting 17 this year and tickling the twinel!l for 43 tallies during his four year career. Sophomore George Oarivaltis · ignited many a scoring threat with his record 11 season assists. All season loog, the potent and explosive Garnet attack of senior Co-Captains Jeffries and Denio and sophomore Garivaltis ran tbeir opponents, good or bad, slow or fast, into the ground. The halfbacks, seniors Rich Earl, Ralph Routnain, and Don Ward, plus frosh John Kovacs were a critical factor in this, the year of years. Domination of the midfield for the first time in this writer's memory marked the p'lay of the '75 squad, and was, ably providec;i by the steady play of this quartet.

Note: Gloves on hands to prevent sunburn: Photos by Les Trachtman Gridders Drop Finale by CHARUE FLANAGAN About 2500 spectators, numb from the cold, watched two of New York State's oldest rivalries do battle for the 80th time, dating back to 1890, with Hamilton coming out on top 13-7. Saturday's brisk Canadian cold front seemed to stall any kind of offense the Dutchmen attempted to muster. The win, the first for Hamilton over Union since 1971, evened the Continentals record at 4-4, while dropping Union's overall mark to a disappointing 1- 7. \l thought we were going to win that one,\ said head mentor Cahill. \It was a matter of one play.\ .. Wait till next year,\ was the echo heard within the gray confines of the Old Gym. Cahill added further that he intends to travel a circUit that will make pit stops in Frank Hoster territory; Columbus, Ohio; and the Steel City of Pittsburgh in hopes of obtaining athletes that will · turn the uncompetitive 1 football program around. \The kids playing now want to play, and that helps,\ Cahill added. \The young ones are a year more experienced. They know what it takes to win, and that helps. If we can supplement that group with incoming personnel, we're that much improved.\ Union actually had a chance to salvage a victory, until freshman halfback Billy Romaine's unmolested catch in the fourth period resulted in a 70 yard . ,' scoring play. The Dutchmen drew first blood in the second period on a 45 yard pass from Andy Terranova to side kick Jim Spa 0 feller: John Ballard booted the P.A.T. Jim Brown's foot kept Hamilton out of good field position throughout much of the blustery afternoon. In fact, Union's offense seemed to go to sleep for the remainder of the day, as the game reverted to a punting contest. Bob · Mathias would electrify the audience with his fancy footwork upon recervmg a Hamilton punt, but then the. offense just could not initiate any momentum. IL it was not for the outstanding play of the defense, led by Capta.in Kev~n Hennegan and the return of tackle Charlie Alter, the score may have beert higher, for they kept the Continentals at bay until the end of the third period. With less than a minute to play in the third period, Hamilton marched 59 yards in 15 plays to score and even the game at seven apiece. A staunch Garnet goal line defense almost prevented Hamilton's leading ground gainer Romaine· from scoring. Romaine edged over on fourth down with Bill Finan booting the P.A.T. The game winning play came with 5:37 left in the contest. For some strange reason on first down from their own thirty, Hamilton halfback Bill Romaine was teft wide on. the -far side line.
