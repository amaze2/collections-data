According to Miss France.< Travis, exl•cutive a~,;bt­ ant of publication, the only change in th!' form of the bulletin is the addition of the names of the collegeo at which faculty membC!'s rec!'ived their degt·ees. According to the date on its cover· the bulletin should not ap- pear until May. Last year, when it was reorganized. the publica- tion was issued in April. It is felt that it is advantageous to get the up-to-date bulletin pub- lished early for the benefit of men who will enroll in next year's freshman class.

This sug·gestion. based on the fact that the ::;ong·- sters received $:iGO from the l Inion .student tax fund and, after presenting a 12 minute assembl~· program, had sched- uled no other campus appeamnce fm· the season, wa·s made 11ot fo1· the benefit of the Clee Club alone, but for all stu- dents. It was sincert'ly felt that :me h a concert would be fav- orably received and supported. The ren!lt of last year's dance-concert led to this belief. Last night the initial campus concert of the year was pre- sented. The audience was composed of 6:3 pPrsnns, onlr half of whom were students. Should the Concordicnsis apolog·ize for going out on a limb and advocating such a Pl'Og'l'Hl11 '? v\'e don't think so. IlepOltS have re~1ched us that members of the Glee Club would offer· a \\\'e told you so!\ If thi:-; he the case we offer the follow- ing: The attendance at the campus cuncel't was admittedly small. This seems to indicate that the students do not favor such a concert and that our assumption was false. On the other hand last year's program was very well attended and apparently enjoyed by all. Iloes this mean that the student's taste::; and desires have chang·ect in the .interim'? We doubt it. o cluck, was forcibly detained until. a quarter past the hour. U11der the very able leader·ship of Chester H. Robinson, '40, ~tu­ dent director, the Glee Club, ac- companied by Paul H. Best, '41, at the piano, opened the con'cert and its first group of four songs ::;ing- ing \Jerusalem by Parr•y, all in unison. This number, !il{e all the numbers that followed, was most enthusiastically received by every one of the sixty-three members of the audience present. Next on the program was one of the club's mo::>t effective selections, \All in the April Evening.\ by Hugh S. Rob- erton, rendered in somewhat of a typically - popular Fred Waring style. This was immediately fol- lowed by Richard Wagner's \'0 Fount of Love Eternal,\ from \Parsifal and was beautifully ac- companied by Charles H. Guiles. '40, on the chimes. The la~t number in this group was the climatic \All Pr·aise to God in Light Arrayed,\ also ·by Waguer. J!'or an encore the Glee Club sang the often-requested \On Great Lone Hills,\ from \Fin- landia,\ by the famom> Finnish com- poser Jean Sibelius. The second pat·t of the program favor·ed the college Double Quar- tet, whose tir:;t song was \And When the Leaveo,\ an old Yale fav- m·ite. For th~ir next rendition the ('olorful octet struck a little less sPrious pose, and donning long pointed noses and thin blac!{ mustaches they sang A. E. Hall's arrangement of \My Evaline.\ The blending of these eight men's voices was so perfect that it called for three more encores: \Far Above Cayuga's Waters,\ \On the Banks of the Old Raritan,\ and \Caris- sirna\ -the college alma maters of Cornell, Rutgers, and Hamilton, respectively. In the first of these encores Kenneth E. Mackenzie, '41, did an excellent job in singing the first-tenor solo part. The full Glee Club took the stage DISC-CUSSIONS Benny Goodman's rendition of t-;t~ulin' Applt>s and Opus Local 802 i~ just what you'd expect from thi~ gr·oup of ,;tellar musicians. Expert ensemble work with special credit to the sax section and fine solos by Benny, Ziggy Elman on trumpet, and Toottl Mondeliu on tenor sax. . . . The score from \Finocchio\ really isn't very good a·lthough Give a Little Whistle has been given ·such competent handling by Woody Herman's orchestra that it is worthy of mention. Woody's vo- calizing on the reverse Peach Tree Strt>et ruins what might have been an excellent blues number .... I Wlllk With Music, from .. Three After Three'\ and Irt>nt\ from \Irene are played in a danceable, smooth way by J·ohnny Green. Jack Smith interprets the lyrics on both sides. Hildegat·de·s late::>t album for Decca contains six beautiful show tunes by Rodgers and Hart, and, as could be predicted, it is a worthy, successor to ber album of Noel Coward tune~ which she also re- · corded for Decca. Tht> songs are Love.i·, \~iith a Sung in My Heart, Thou Swell, The Blue Room, My Hen.rt Stood Still, and Isn't lt Ro- mantic and I don't think a better selection could tlave been made. S. G. once mor·e to portray three mor·e se!Pctions: first. Harling's arrange- ment of \Dreamworld by the French composer Henri Duparc; secondly, Marshall Bartholomew's all'angement of \Think of Me\; and thirdly, a rather ligut Hamp:;hire folk-song called \Swansea Town,\ by Gustav Holst. For their final _•ncore the Glee Club, all \rocking like pendulum;:;\ and \cukooing like funny blue-birds,\ sang the ever- poputar, humorous number enti',led \The Three Clock,;,\ by l:<'r·edericll A, Starke. The fourth part of the program t Ullled the figm·ative spotlight upon Benjamin F. Guiles of the fresh- man cla:~;:;, who;:;e ::>plendid inter- prptation of Stephen Foster's \I Dream of JpnniP\ demanded an- othPr tenor ::>olo, the well-known \Just a Wearying,\ as an encore. For· the third and last time the PntirP Glee Club mountl:'d thl' steps to conclude its rppetoire of wngs by singing first Rudolf Friml's \'Mar·ch of the Muskett'ers,\ fol- lowed by an old wl:'stern cowboy melody, \Catele:s Lace,\ by Keith McLeod. The next selection once again featured Benjamin Guiles, '43, in the tenor obligato of an old Finnish folk-song called \Summer Evening,\ by Selim Palmgr·en, and this number· was directly followed by Walter Scotson's popular ar- r·angement of \I Love a Parade,\ by Harold Arlen. Could it not he pos:-;ihle that the apparent failure of this concert to draw a crowd was the result of a numbe1· of un- fortunate circumstances and conflicting interests'? We feel that the f.tudent body has mi::;ged a golden opportunity by not attending a concert especially planned for its members- an oppmtunity which alumni and friends of Union pay to enjoy. Students' failure to make the most of such opportun- ities will have a boomerang effect and in time the opportun- ities will cease presenting themselves. The blame, if there can truly be one, does not fall alone upon the students. A concert, scheduled for the middle of the week iR likely to be poorly attended. One given imme- diately prior to a wee!< of hour examinations is more likely to receive slight recognition. Without doubt the intramural program scheduled for the evening of the concert had no small affect upon the attendance and the omi.ssion of the I usual Glee Club skit perhaps detmcted from the offerings of Every day people the world over stop a mo- ment ... enjoy an ice-cold Coca- Cola ..• and go their way again with a happy after-sense of complete refreshment.

Adamzevich and Bothwell vs. Sherman Appwximately 1,000 rabid fol-<i>-----------------·- lowers of ·Fistiana are exnected to jam the bleac·hers of the Alumni Uymnasium tomorrow evening to cheer themselves hoarse for their tistic heroes and grappling gladia- tor,:; in- the greatest intramural event of the year, the finals of the Hth Annual Intramural Boxing and Wrestling Carnival which -be- gins at 8 o!clocl\. The progzam faz· ::latUI·day evening finds twelve leather tcsse1s 1eady to slug it out nom the opening bell and fourteen wrestle1s 1arin' to match strength !lnd :skill. The highl'ight of tomQrrow eve-· ning's boxing card p1 omises to -be the heavyweight battle between the king of the heavyweight divi- sion, J-i.m. Bothwell, and sophomore Lee Sherman. Bothwell has had a colorful caree1· in 1:-is fistic sczaps in the intramural tourney of other years. In his freshman year. after dropping Jake Amazon, then ca-p- tain of the football team, to the tloor six times, Bothwell was forced to 1 elinquish claim to the heavyweight crown when Ed Fitz refused to allow him to finish the fight due to bad cut above his tight eye. La~t year, J-im was pitted against Leo MacCarthy, rugged neutral scrapper. After a grueling battle in which both sluggel'E ab s01 bed plenty uf punh;hment, Both- well was awarded the decisivn via the technical kayo route. Sherman, who will enter the ring with a thil·ty pound weight advantage, has yet to be seen with a pair of gloves on. His weight and strength prom- ise to make him a hard puncher and he may give Bothwell plenty of trouble in defending his cz·own. Mot P interest rises from the fact that both men are members of the varsity football team, Bothwell holding down the left end pmt dur- ing the past two seasons and Sher- man dividing the quarterbacking assignment with Dick Balch this yPar. Krull, Adamzevich Top Bill In the wrestling division most of the interest centers around the battle between Johnny Krull and Johnny Adamzevich. Krull, who last yea1· won the 158-74 title, is spotting his opponent 26 pounds. I.::oth men have EO far chalked up two quick falls over their oppon- Pnts. Krull has thrown both Boyn- ton and Molloy while Adamzevich has experienced little trouble in pinning Bob Nothacker and Paul Jones. For the past few years Krull has reigned taps in the 158-174 class, but this year has stepped up to the heavy-weight class in search cf new titles. Adamzevich promises to put up a stiff battle on Saturday night. Sal Mauriello and George Bedell will trade punches for the 155-165 title in anothet· topnotch bout of the evening. Mauriello, a south- paw, won the title last year with a victm,- over Bob Killian. A two fisteq, hard hitting fighter, Maur- iello will put up a stiff battle be- fate he relinquishes his title to Bedell. Mauriello d1 ew a b,-e into the finals while Bedell scored a technical kayo over Don Dingman before he entered the finals. In ~lugging Dingman into submission in the second round of their scrap, BE.>dell proved himself a clever boxet· as well as a hard hitter. In the lightweight class Don Geisel is pitted against Verner Sharp for the title vacated by Beecher Leversee. who did n<>t en- ter the tournament this yeaz·. Gei- Pel entered the finals the hard way, winning c'Pcisions over Buckland and Daneski in two fast bouts. Sharpe outpointed Cardenas and drew a bye in entering the finals. Both men m·e clever boexrs and know how to handle their fiSits. In the opinions. of the campus seers tbe scrap is a tossup. In th 135-145 class both Bill Wardwell and Lou Semenoff are battling foz· the title vacted by Paul Santee, who will be remembered for his haymaker which kayoed both Semenoff and Wardwell la>t year, the latter in the finals. So far this year Semenoff has scored a techni- cal over Phil Westlake and earned a well deserved overtime dicision from \Doc\ Orton. Wardwell has met but o~e. opponent, Bob Dake, finishing him off in one t'O\llld. Semen.off boasts a pretty right hand and a clever style of box:ing which will prove troublesome to the ag- gressive two fisted style of fight- ing used by Wardwe-ll. Harwood, F.retto Mi.-.:: It Up nicals in two fights over Toby 0hampli-n and Bob Ericson, boasts a ·strong right and plenty of power in his left. A two fisted, hard hit- ting tighter Harwood is probably Ol'le of the most colorful boxers to enter the toUrnament since it was founded by Elmer Oliphant in 1926. l!'t·etto slaims his share of colorful- ness with his wild swinging ahd unorthodox style as eviden~Pd. by his victory over Bruce Scid-mur:•. rhe two of them at·e apt to :;tago: the most exciting bout of the eve- ning, with leather tlying from all points of the ring. In the last bout on the boxing card, Andy Speziali will match ling prowess and powe1· with Ed Green. Speziali sh0wed plenty of power and a knowledge of the boxinJ game in battering the game Jewell Homing in their scrap Wednesday evening. Green has yet to ap-pear i;~, the 1 ing, dz a wing a bye into the .inals, but if his condition is bette1· than that of Speziali's he is a long shot to win. The title of the 165-17b class wa:; last held by Jake Amn· zen who won it two years ago in his tight with Jim Bothwell. Last , ear there were no entries in this class, Coffin Ch:tllPngPs Mt>ad Howells Coffin is the challenger in the lightweight wrestling class with Talbot Mead the defender. Mead won the title last year when he pinned McCartney. Mead is the favonte in this bout deEpite Cuf- fin's victory over Noonan on Wed- nesday evening. Aamn Thai is the favol'ite to pin Paul Dwyer in the 125-135 class for the title vacatd by Billy Thomas when he graduated last spzing. Dwyer, who lost tu l'homas last year in the quat·te.- finals, has pinned both Kahn and Dutcher in advancing to the finals and Thal has thrown Jones anJ Annese in his two previous matche~. In addition to his five pound weight advantage, '!·hal appears to ha1·e the strength advantage as well as a greater knowledge of the art 'ln ·his side. In what appears to be one of the best and closest matches of the camival, Bernie O'Neil will match his strength with Bob Shepard for the title of the 135-145 class which was won laot year by Avery Beer who is not defending his crown. O'Neil has shown three men in advancing to the finals, Watanabe, Coates and Senn, while Shephard pinned Bob Muthcr to the mat and won by a time advantage over Lew Hallenbeck. Both men appear evenly matched as far as weight. (Continued on Page 4) Douw F.

Harwood had previously knockld out Champlil'l to advance into the semi-finals. Ericson quickly wf'ak- ened before Harwood's winclmill tactics and willingly consented to quit the ring upon Ed Fitz''l re- quest. It is believed that Eric~,m suffered an arm injury in his first bout with Bruce May and was un- able to punch with the same power he exhibited in his earlier fight. In subduing Ericson the wild swing- ing Harwood earned the right to meet the equally wild Patsy Fretto in the finals on Saturday night. GPisel Tops Dant>ski In a bout t.hat had the· earmarks og being one of the best so far in the tourney, Don Geisel outpoint- ed Vic Daneski to win the fight by the dicision of the judges. Both boys loeked clever and fiashed ex- ceHent form at times. Geisel'ti more effeetive punches won him the de- cision. Daneslti was one of the cleverer boxers in the tourney be- fore his elimination laEt evening. In the third scrap of thE> eve- ning, Andy Speziali earned an easy deci~ion over Jewell Horning. Aft- er a slow initial round, Speziali opened up in the second round and m•arly had Horning down for the ~ount. Horning was cut badly with lefts ancl rights to the head as Speziali pounded him against the ropes. Speziali, who did not appear to be in top shape, tired in the last round and Horning helcl him off as he tried for a ldll in the last round.

It was the little men who provid- ed the excitement in the wrestling matches as Howells Coffin pinned Bill Noonan in 2:45 in their bout to advance to the finals where he will meet Talbot Mead for the crown. Mead is the defending king of the 125 pound class. In the other lightwPight matches on the Wed- nesday evening card Aaron Thai pinned Joe· Annese and at the ~arne time looked like one of the best men to appear in the tourney sa far.

Robert Canuti, the AP's English-educated Turkish correspondent, hadn't had a first-class story for almost three months-not since the Turko-British treaty handed the Kremlin a short and snappy answer. ~ But while man was dozing, Nature woke. Be- neath the surface of ancient Asia Minor. subter- ranean ledges lost their age-long balance, slipped and skidded sideways. The first totals of homeless. dead, and injured- usual.!;- exaggerated in such disasters-were not ex- aggerated this time. Pictqres that came by \slow camel\ added to the terrible tale. It was the biggest earthquake story since Yokohama. And Robert Can uti, his months of waiting ended, had it on the wires to the western world before it was known in the streets of Istanbul. At once, the machinery of international relief began to whir, and help was on the way. D> Most people think of Press Association men as daring young acrobats of the newspaper world. always somersaulting from one hot story to another • , , now in Tokio, next in Singapore-now in Buch- arest, soon at Brussels. But the complete, the almost miraculous, world- coverage of the great Press Services comes from men who mostly stand and wait. Correspondents like Robert Canuti in the quieter capitals-and the thousands of \stringers in the world's little towns and villages, so-called because they paste their infre- quent dispatches into a string and meas.ure their payment by the inch. Men like these form the nerve ends of the wire services-indispensable divisions of journalism's army of 300,000 men. ~The development of these world-wide Press Serv- jces, accurate, unbiased, and unsubsidized, is an American achievement. It is an outstanding exam- ple of American organizing genius-and it has all happened within the lifetime of most news-readers now living. More than that, the Press Services are the standard bearers, throughout the world. of the 20th century American tradition of accuracy and fair play in news-reporting. Something new under the sun. llo- It wasn't until the 1890s that the dream of the modern Associated Press began to take form. A few courageous pioneers-Victor Lawson, Frank B. Noyes, Melville Stone, and Adolph Ochs-worked zealously for it, and in time press associations began pointing eager fingers at the map of the world and putting new correspondents wherever a fat dot showed an important city. By the time an emperor with a withered arm unleashed the hounds of war in I 9 I 4. U. S. Press Services had spun their webs around the globe. AP's now seasoned network was being kept on its mettle by a lusty young competitor, an independent service called United Press, fathered in 1907 by E. W. Scripps. Due chiefly to the vision of these pioneers, the U.S., in less than half a century. has shed its news provincialism. Today ... let a flood sweep down the Yangtze, a strike begin in Melbourne, a regiment revolt in Addis Ababa, and in a matter of minutes· or hours the teletypes in th~ U. S. be- gin to chatter. ~ FLASH-call~ the foreign ca- ble, and begins gasping out its own curt, staccato lan- guage ... SMORNING FRENCH CRCISER AIR-BOMBED IN ENG· LISH CHANNEL. \Flash calls the New York operator. \French cruiser bombed.'' A Gazette Press Printers rewrite man works frantically. and soon the fingers of another operator start the electric current flo·w- ing. Operators in Philadelphia, Chicago, and al- most a score of other U. S. cities stand up crying \Flash.\ In a few seconds, every cranny of the U. S. will have the news. From 50.000 news sources all over the globe, this river of news flows day and night. For while Amer- ica sleeps, one half the world is wide-awake, busy getting into and out of trouble, busy making that vivid, perishable stuff called news. II> To every self-respecting newspaper, Press Asso- ciation news is the breath of life. A paper pays for as much of it as it can afford and use. A country weekly can have as little as SIS worth a week, a metropolitan daily as much as 52,500. But whether a paper gets \pony\ or multiple wire service, it counts its Press Association service as perhaps its most valuable asset. .,. Press Association news is just as indispensable to The Weekly Newsmagazine as to a daily newspaper. To be sure, TIME has its own special correspondents, too-its own force of 500 news-scouts-its own check-and-query system. But the stories from the daring acrobats and the quiet watchers of the Press Associations supply a basic pattern of the world's news ... the vital pat- tern, which in the Newsmagazine becomes the con- tinuing narrative history of our times, followed every week by 700,000 cover-to-cover readers. This is one of a series of advertisements in which the Editors of TIME hope to give College Students a clearer picture of the world of news- gathering, news-writing, and news-reading-and the part TIME plays in helping you to grasp, measure. and use the history of your lifetime as you live the story of your life.

Twice before in recent years has such an opp01'tunity presented itself and twice before has ;\lem- orial Chapel been filled to capacity in anticipation. spring has finally come. To a con- ~idHable portion of the world it is a sym:bol of joy and reawakening life. To the nations at war it mean~ , ome sot t of increased ac- tivity. Today it is Reynaud; tomor- row it may be Hen·iot, Flandin, Chautemps, or Daladier again. Pre- miers and ministl'rs may come and go. There is, howevet, no retreat- ing now. This is a struggle to the end for French .prestige through- out the wotld, the maintenance of the French capitalistic system, and th<' intPgrity of the Ft·ench empire. John A.

The following year in .i\Iarch, Lauritz ;\lelchoir, dramatic tenor also of the :\letropolitan Opera Company, honored us with a similar concert, this one as a compliment to Mrs. Wal- ter C. Baker for her devoted interest to the college. And this rem· for the third time Union will have the op- portunity to listen to a gTeat opera stm·-an opportunity which so many persons hope for, but nevet· t•ealize. The scheduled appeanmce of Mr. Huehn on the Friday night be- fore Prom -..viii make this Prom week-end the most spectac- ular, interest-crammed and gayest of all Pmm week-ends. We can assure l.\Ir. Huehn that he ·will sing to a Union audience equally as large, eqmllly a~ enthusiastic and equally as attentive as those which received Ml'.

Al:;berg, fermer directm· of the Federal Writet·s' Project, told students and faculty in the field of EBgJoish, and thl' studPnts in daily assembly, that literature is no longE>t' confined mE>rely to novel\ poetry, short stories and criticism, but that it has spread into the non- fictional field and has, in fact, \more inftuE'nce upon the country\ than any other fot·m of writing to- day, He said, fot· example, that Stein- beck':; boolt, \Grapes of Wrath,\ has had more influence upon what Congress and the Governor of Cal- ifornia are doing today than any novl'l ever publishl'd. \This is the time when writers have thl' greatest opportunity be- caut5e there are wider fil'lds in which he can concentrate and they can exercise widet· influence on cur- rent thinking. Writers today are concentrating on the Amet·ican sc~ne, but not necessarily through novels.\ Contrasting present day writers with literature's immortals of Sl'V- eral centuries ago, Mr. Alsberg ex- plained that cunent authors \think less of immortality now and think more uf what they write than of how they write it. They don't even carl.' whether their books are read five years hence-they simply want them read now. They want the pub- lic to know what they at·e feeling and they write to produee imme- diate results.\ Guest at Hale Club Mt·. Alsberg arrivE'd on the cam- pus Tuesday afternoon and held informal conferences with faculty membet·s, was guest of honor at a dinner in Hale Housl', at which thE' faculty mE'mbers of the field of English were present, then at- tended the Hale Club meeting at the homE> of Dr. Johnson. He abo attended the Mountebanks pel·form- ance of \The Pursuit of Happi- ness.\ Wednesday morning he d!scussf'd contemporary writers before Pt·o- fessor Wainger's class in AmE'rican litE'rature, talked to the whole stu- dent body on opportunities existing for journalists and writers today, and talked with one of Professor Johnson's classes in Freshman Eng- lish. He was the luncheon guest of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity where he later had an informal dis- cussion with the members of the Mountebanks Theatre, discussing the development in writing for the theatre and its allied art<', radio, cinema, and television. Mr. Alsberg suggested that writ- ers are influential because they deal with man as the victim of his en- vironment-for the same reason, he added, the works of these writers cannot ''live\ as those by writers who dealt also with man's rela- tionship to more spiritual things.

The Inte1·collegiate Bt·oadeast- ing System, technically known as the \IBS\, was organized only last. month at an intercollegiate conference sponsored by the Brown Network at Brown University. Its operation i-s comparatively simple and it may be undertaken with a mini- mum of facilities. The system bring:-; daily programs io dormitol\ies and fra-ternity hou~Ps by low-powet·ed short wave over a 30,000-foot web of trarcsmission lines.

Th .. t:;_,l ,,., I' Not all colleges o1· universities have even the \minimum of facilities\ necessary to establish such a system, but in this case l 1 nion's position is excellent. Not only do we possess two organizations directly connected with broad- casting and radio consb·uction and development, but the proximity of the National Broadcasting· System's WGY and its connection with our Radio Workshop make Union's qualifications if not perfect, almost so. The Radio Club, with its short wave station and equipment in the Electrical Engi- neering Building, serves as a nucleus around which to o1·ganize a local IBS station, if such arrangements could he made. ~lany of the charter members, which include Bro\\'11, Cornell, Columbia, Holy Cross, Pembroke, Rhode Island State, St. Lawrence, Univen>ity of Connecticut, \Vesleyan and Williams, have had to build stations as well as organize the project and pUl'chase equipment. In this matter l'nion is al- ready a leader. With the physical equipment of the Radio Club as a foun- dation, the membe1·s of the Club combined with, or in co- operation with, the members of the Radio Workshop, which includes men interested in the technical aspects of program planning, direction and production, tend to make the college's position in such an enterprise decidedly advantageous. 10.20·11: 10.

Hopes fot a succeseful varsit)·~ bas~baH :oeason grew brightet· la::-t wee!' whea AI Mould, lanky ,·eniot moumlsman, t·eporlcd to Art Lawrence for hi.s first workout of t·he year. Mould, who sta·ned for the Dutchmen last sea\on had bee.! barred from ptactice for three weeks due to illness. Mould i~ re- membered for his fine piece of pitching in the S:, racuse garr.e last Alumni Day when he muffled the Orange bat~ and gave the vat sit) thek t:hird win of the ~ea.;on, 3·2 In t,he opinion of Coa•ch Lawr- ence, catcher Harry Pa-lmet and Mould will form one of the most e!.f.ective batteries in the collegiate circuit in thi::; area. Palmer, who has been behind the plate for the vaz sity for two :, ears, is a heady receiver who wotk:,; the hurlers well and is given much credit for the de- velopment of Mould. Palmct alsc pos~es.ses a st,rong at·m which is a constant threat to any enemy run- net's tr:, ing to stPal a base. VPtP.ran Hurlt'rs Mou!d will head a hmling staf! dudded with ~uch veterans a\ Chet Robinson, \Swede\ Hans0n, Roger Moran and Mike Fiester. At the present time Ham:·on is slated fo-r the number two bet th and Robin- son will be the number three pitcher. These men are all senio1s while the two junior veterano. Motan and Fieslet·, will •be thE' re- lief pitcher~. Robinson may easily pitch hi:; way back to the n umbet one .::;pol he h~s held fm·mcrly if he acquireb control. Chet i~ a southpaw with plenty of spred and a nice cmve but ha:> dropped a numbet of garr.es in the past through hi, wildness. If Robinson returns to !otm and can rotate in the mcunc: assignments \Vith Mould, it is likely that the Dutchmen will d, far bet- ter than their three victories and live lo~sP>l of last year. JnfipJd :SPt ·Coach Lawrence lost only Ftankie Myers, second baseman, !rom .hi~ infield of last year. With Ned Reilly, Uashy sophomore, ca- pable of filling the gap, Lawrence has a likely looking inne1 defen\e for the CUI lain raiser with Middle- bury on Ap1 il 20th. The infield may lineup with Charlie Broclmer at !ir~t. Ned Reilly at second, Micke) Rathlev at short~top and either AI Turehick or Fred Chesebro at thin!. ChPsebro was one of the sta1·s of la;·t yeats yearling team and may nose Turchick from the hot comet. Billy Thomas and Bob I<'eldman both gr·aduated fJ\Om the outfiC'ld last June and at prrsent six men at·e bidding fm· bE-rths in the outer pa:oture. The outtield will probably bP made up of Fted Pa- trie in left, Earl RaifstangPr at center and Moe Weintraub in right field. AI Rasso, Don Phillips and Andy Speziali are also fighting to break into the starting outfield. Rathlev Lt'ads Sluggers Art LawrPnce is expecting Brock- ncr, Patrie, Rathlev and Weintraub to pic!' up where they left off last year in the \lugging depattment and do the heavy sticl,work for the team, Rathlev lead the Dutchmen at the plate la~t season and was followed closely by Charlie Brock- ner. Patrie and Weintraub, who were in and out of the lineup la::t year, drove in their share of mns also. With these men dl'iving in runs, steady pitching from Mould, Robinson and Han::on and with their share of the breaks, Lawr- ence thinks his ~quad ::hould win at leaFt half their games.

But yet, to give vent to a tt\Uism. nothing is more vital to the na- tion's military and civilian popula- tions, who at·c marching, riding flying, and miling on their Etom- achs. than the meat and milk from British stock ( i. e., of the hoofed variety). Thus the Mini!\ters of Agriculture are urging that no less than 2.000;000 acres of now un-culti- vated land be put under the plow this spring. This means four addi- tional ac1es for every farming unit in England, Scotland, Wales, and Ulster. A big order this, but one the indus try is expected to fill. To \ucceed farmers will have to seed everything but the highways, and win the support of small town gar- dening populations. .Thousands of lamp-post postets bear the curt suggestion, \Dig for Victory\; post· age stamps are cancelled with thP same legend. It is seriously :>Ug- gested that the ·grePnsward about our residence be turned to potatoes, and enPrgetic members of the Women's Union of the university have obtained the ready con>ent ol the committee of the Men's Union to work the patch of ground in the rpar of the latter's establishment. If Britain does succeed in feed- ing het domestic livestock with British foodstuffs next winter, one of the un-head-lined but most signi- ficant and, ·because of its very lack of color, gallant, victories of the war will have been won during the summer months that are on the way. In the next column we propose to salute you one<> more from Geneva where we are wending our way during the appt·oaching Eastm· va- cation to do some research in the International Labour Office, renew acquaintan()<'s, and <we pray!) do some skiing. The imposing array of red tape which the fm eign serv- iceE of four nations can preEent in war-time, we have finally waded through, and will be on our way.

The resignation is to become effective at the conclusion of the curTent academic year. A graduate of Princeton and Cambridge univer:;ities, Professor Green was appointed instructor of Public Speaking by President Rich- mond in 1924, became Instructor of English in 1925 and was promoted to the 1ank of Aosistant Professor of English by President Day in 1933 and served in this capacity for one year. In 1927 President Richmond se- cured a Carnegie Foundation grant of art pictures and books for Union and placed Professor Gr ecn in charge of a newly organized course in the History of Art.

This film, which was produced in France, is based upon the famous novel by Dostoyeviski. The French film has been rated as \excellent\ by the National Board of Reviews of Motion Pictures. The Board adds: \It has extracted from Dos- toyeviski's tr·emendous· tale of con- science, with its deep psychological explorations, the essential dramatic conflict that was suitable to the medium of the picture, and pre- sented it with extraordinary cum- ulative power. Direction, acting, at- mosphere are all equal to tl::e story's great demands. The film deserves a place among motion pic- ture classics comparable. to the place the novel fills in literature.\ Henry Baur Plays Lead The cast of the picture includes Henry Baur, famous· French actor, as Porphyre. Other actors appear- ing in the film under the direction of Pierre Chenal are Pierre Elan- char and. Madeline Ozerzay. The film will be shown with English titles. The last in the series of foreign films will be shown on March 25 when the Mountebanks will pre- sent the German film, \Heimat\. Students will be admitetd to the movie on Wednesday night free. There will be a slight charge, however, for towns people who wish to attend. The last In the series of Mountebanlts historical films was given on last Monday evening.

Is~ue Edito1· .......................................... John Phillips Assistants Solomon Ulechrnan Tom- O'Connor ===---- Ft iday, March 1, 1940 EDITORIAL POLICY It is an accepted truism that the most popular college newspaper editorial, in the eyes of the average student, is of a caustic natme and that the populal'ity of the editorial is in direct propo1·tion to its vitriolic content. Underg-raduates who, theoretically, have chosen their college above all others, appem· to take a sadistic delig-ht in reading editorials which attempt to prove that theil· alma mater has feet of cla,v. The student editor who dashes off fiery denunciations faculty members and who has no patience with what he con- siders to be the failings of the college administration will never- lack readers, and is certain to be enshrined in the hearts of his fellow students as the disciple of truth and the champion of student rights. If, then, our editorial-s have not been sufficiently trenchant in tenor for the students who have, from time to time, indi- cated a des,ire for a more c1·itical editorial policy, we offer ou1· apologies. Our \passive\ policy is, however, one bred of an early 1·esolution not to be critical for the sake of being critical, and is not due to an~v lack of fortitude, or \guts.\ It requires, we feel, but a minimum of courage to hide safely behind the protection of an editorial column and throw darts merely bec<mse a morbid few en.io~· watching the victims writhe. \i\' e have no compunction about using- the editorial as a weapon if the occasion demands, but we question its promiscuous use as a bludg·eon merely to see how much havoc it can wreak. The Concordiensis, to our knowledge; has always been a student newspaper and will, we hope, continue as such. There have been no attempts to censor the paper and we have yet to learn of an editor who was called to account by college authorities for any opinions which he expre~sed. Other col- leges have instituted such measures as direct censorship, faculty supervisors, weekly \discussions\ with the President, and tacit threats of expulsion in their efforts to dictate the tone of their newspapers. The Concordiensis is 100 r;t free of such restraining- influences. We have been accorded gentle- manly treatment and we hesitate to violate the confidence which has been placed in us merely to g-ain an audience. Obviously, Union has several failings but these shortcom-; ings are not, we feel, of the nature which will be amelol'i.ated: by caustic editorial tirades. New dormitories, additional li- bi'al'Y facilities, an improved gymnasium and increased schol- arships are items which require outlays of more money than Union now has at its disposal; there is little point in plag·uing an impecunious man for his inability to build a mansion. For those who feel that The Concordiensis editorial policy is not sufficiently \alive\ we point to our \In the Mail\ col- umns, in which we invite any student to write his own edi- torial on any subject of his own choosing. We will print any serious letter of reasonable length which bears the signature of the correspondent, and will withhold the identity of the author if he so requests. If, then, your conception of the most acceptable edit01·ial policy differs from ours, we invite you to write your own editorial \In the l\lail.\ THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MARCH 1, 19-J.O CALENDAR Toda~· 6:30 p. m.

Profes:oor Male also asserted that aside from the obvious musical benefits de1ived from the 01 ganiza- tion, the worthwhileness of the band is further proven by some 300 letters he has received f1·om alumni who were forme1· members of the Band. They are full of exp1·e~sions of appreciation and thanks for the opportunity of playing in the Band, and not a few have mentioned the facilitating of getting employment after graduation through their ex- perience in the Band.

Random Facts In History of Chapel Revealed By 'Alumni Monthly' Files Newe~t of Union College's edi-~·,__--------------­ fices, Memorial Chapel, has a his- tory which, although it is much the same as that of similar build- ings, nevertheless offers the ~n­ quiring much interesting matPrml through which to browse. Thus inspheu by its pofsibilitie~. The Concordiensis reporter first attacke<.l the dim 1·ecesses of the college library. Hen, midst the Union Collection, the files of the Alumni Monthly offer a contem- porary picture of the Chapel's in- ception and final completion. Opening one volume at t•andom the reporter spotted an article mentioning the fact that the aca- demic year of 1923-1924 was for- mally opened in the gymnasium be- cause there was no other meet- ing place large enough to hou:;e all those wi~hing to attend. Proceeding more or less logically from this point, ihe searcher, by diligent use of Miss Thompson's Alumni Mo-nthly index, discovered the letter sent by President Rich- mond in which he fit•st broached the subject of a new chapel. In student meetings the year before, the president ~aid, over 100 of the college's 700-odd students had to stand for want of sufficient seating accommodations. $200,000 was set as the amount ;necessary for the chapel's constructibn, and alumni benefactors were asl{ed to con- !'tibute. In the fall of 1924 the \Monthly's\ editor is worried because work is proceeding behind schedule~ The contt·actor who was to supply the marble necessary for the columns for the front of the chapel failed to \come th1ough\ on schedule, and wm k on the building's roof was se- riou:;ly delayed. Commencement of June 1925 had been selected as the logical time to use the chapel for the first time, but it was not com- pleted until the following f!all, wifh a consequent delay in the chapel's introduction to service. The Alumni publication for the following fall contained accounts of the building's dedication. But a vidt to the home of Dr. Chat·Ies N. Waldron promised interesting sidelights on the subject. \The construction of a new chapel was the project whieh was closest to President Richmmid's heart,\ Dr. Waldron said, \but it is interesting to note that he waited until class buildings, which were really more necessary, had: been constructed before he asked for a chapel.\ \Those light purple panes of glass may have been put in the chapel wmdows to imitate a colonial meet- ing house, but they also serve to reduce glare inside the chapel,\ Dr. Waldron remarked. \The white interior of the building undoubtedly made that necessary.\ Seniors who will soon be starting in earnest in their !Oearch -for em- ployment will be given the chance to practice their interview \tech- nique\ according to a reeent an- nouncement by Placement Bureau Director Fred Wyatt. Mr. Wyatt stated that plans a1 e being com- pleted which will allow .seniors to actually practice interviewing pl'Os- pective employers. Officials of the General Electric Company, the American Locomotive Company, as well a!O the Superintendents of the School Systems in Schenectady and Scotia are cooperating in the pro- gram. Seniors who take advantage of t,his oppoi,tunity will be granted inte1 views with the \employers\, which will closely resemble actual employment interviews. At the completion of the interview, the ex- ecutives will offer suggestions and otherwise criticize the technique used by the seniors. Mr. Wyatt also announced that on Wednesday Mr. F. L. Kemp, and Mr. R. 0, Ackerman of the General Ele·ctric •Company will be on the campus to interview those senior·s who are interested in the Student Test Cour!Oe offet·ed by their com- pany. The inte1views will begin at 9 A. M., and the two men will have luncheon at Hale House at noon with Professor Berg. Also, it was announced that the Navy Depm·t- ment is soon to give examinations to Civil Engineers, which will lead to commissions o-f Second Lieuten- ant in the Navy. Details may be procured at the Placement Bureau. AI Schumacker's Band Signed AI Schumacker's nine piece band has 'been signed to play for the dance.

Mr. Hough Lauds 'Hours of Silence· Outlining the advantages and dis- advantages of kee-ping \hout·s of silence\ The Rev. Lynn Harold Hough spoke on \The Inner Life\ in his Sunday morning set·mon in Memoria. Chapel. Dr. Hough, who is Dean of Drew Theological Sem- inary in Madison, New Jersey had spoken at Union three times previ- ous to his visit last Sunday. \The drama in your inner life is more important than the drama in your outer life,\ he dPclared, \in so far that it will control your character.\ \In the next twenty-five years you aren't going to find much in the extemal world, but if you have inner resources to which you can retreat to be vitalized, energized and magnetized ... you may even- tually come out of your inner self and improve the external world,\ he said. The Revel end Mr. Hough, who was graduated from Drew with a degree of Doctor of Divini-ty, contin- ued, explaining that hours of si- lence may diEci.pline and enrich, but they also make you duller than you Wel'e before. They rna:>: harm your personality, and they may also be revealing your inner personality. It wa.s the speaker's opinion that, \having hours of silence in fellow- ship is the first step in entering a new world,\ Charles H. Guiles of Lake George, a candidate for B. S. in Electrical Engineering is a mem- ber of band, glee club, and choir. Everett M. Hafner of Brooklyn, is a candidate for B. S. in Physics and is affiliated with Delta Phi. Lewis W.

T. victory also placed Jdhn Cone leads Scorers this year's Garnet natators in an- other distingui~hed class, since It i,; the third team in the history of the spm·t at Union to win more games than it loBt. The 1922 squad, which was the first swimming team· to represent Union, won two and lost one. Not until 1926 did the col- lege have a winning team again, and this outfit establiBhed the high .record of four wins and two de- feats, which was tied this year. T,riumph No Cinch Although the varsity hockey team · failed to win aH its contests, shut. aut each opponent, and aveJ'age ten: goals per game it did play the high- est percentage of i-ts home contests · since 1934, and tied the best win- loss aver age of .600 e.sta:blishecj in 1927, the fourth year of intercel- legiate hockey at Union College. The 1940 Dutchmen skaters play- ed two out of three home contesto this year while last season all four of the home games were cancelled. In 1938 only one out of three were played; in 1937, one out of four, in 1936, three out of five; in 1935, two out of four; and in 193-i, two out of two. Their Last Laps Captain Burt Brittin \totrches lip\ in his last race for Union as Chuck Passe \pushes off\ for the last lap of the 400 yard relay in Saturday's meet with M. I. 'l'. Coach Joseph Wheatley stands at lett holding watch. The meet Saturday was not an easy one as the M.LT. team kept pace with the Garnet 1 ight down to the next to the last event--the 440- yard freestyle-when t-he score stood at 34 to 25 and with Howard of M.l.T. leading Murphy by a yard at the 400-yard marlt of tne race, things looked black for Union, be- cau~e with Dave Wilder ill, the re- lay team could not possibly hope tG take the event -which gives the winner seven points and a first and third in the 440 would give the visi- tols six points more for a total of 13 to give them the meet, 38 to 37. The .600 winning percentage thi:: year far exceeds the .000 average chalked by the last two intercal- legiate .squads to represent Union on the ice and in 1937 one win in five .games made a .167 average, while In 1936 the team did just a little better, winning two out of seven contests played for a .286 percentage. Yearling Mermen Lose Second Straight Meet Fencers Prep for Last Of Four-'Meet Schedule Murphy, however, saved the day for Union by speeding up the last 40 yards to talte first place and clinch the meet. His margin over Howard could be calculated in inches fur the most spectacular race of the afternoon. The 400-yard relay wa:; won by M.I.T. easily. Other features of SatUiday's con- test were the smashing of two Union College rcr-.~r ds as Gus Mor- rison, backstroker, and Hal Hen- drickson, breaststr·oker, both sopho- moreB, combined with Captain Burt Brittin to take 2.2 Beconds off the medley relay time. On February 14 agaimt McGill University, Morri- son, HendrickBon, and Murphy es- tablished a new record of 3:23 2, but the time of 3:21 in the M.I.T. contest erased this mark. Morrison Breal•s Record Morrison also featut·ed in a sin- gle -race as he took first place in the 150 yard backstroke event, set- ting a new mark of 1:54.2, erasing the time of 1:56.4 set by C. B. Perkins in 1929 when Union met Army. Morrison was far in front of Arny Harwood, a senior, who left a sick bed to swim the meet Saturday. Former Captain Chuck Passe and Gordon Murphy led the Dutchmen with eight points each, while Brit- tin and Morrison with 6 2-3 each, Hendrickson with 4 2-3, Harwood wi~h 3, and Payne and Keers with one each, followed in that order. The meet was the last for Brit- tin, Passe, Bob Sammet and Amy Harwood, all seniors, while Wilder did not compete because of illness.

When the '27 squad establiBh- ed this record, little did Union sup- porters think that it would be as many as 13 seasons later before this record would be duplicated, even bettered. The 1928 squad had a .000 season; the 1929 outfit had a .500 record; the '30 ,beys registered .400, while in '31 the record was .333. In '32 an- ether tl iple zero average is on the records, while the following two years, the Garnet teams appeared with .500 averages. In 1935 a .200 average was made. Senior Johnny Cone led thi.s year's sextet in scoring as they de- feated Norwich at home in the opening contest, 2 to 1, with Cone scoring both tallies. This was the first horne contest a Union hockey team had played in two years lack- ing two days. In the first away contest the Garnet ~uffered its first set•back of the collegiate campaign being shut-out by the Purple sextet, 5 to 0, in a game marked with many interesting sidelights. The second home engagement showed the Dutchmen at their peak when they scored five goals in the first period and coasted to a 7 to 1 victory over St. Lawrence Univer- sity, a team which defeated them 4 to 3 at Lake Placid in a pre-sea- son contest. Also Union lost to Wil- liams and Colgate at Lake Placid in pre-season play for the Samuel H. Packer trophy. Again hitting the road, the Dutchmen lost their 16th consecu- tive contest to the Hamilton Con- tinentals who have never suffered defeat at the hands of a Union sex- tet. The score was 3 to 0.

Poor George I George, as you may know, is Cnion's sole movie character and appears in the tried and true film \George Goes to Cnion,' 'or \Life at a Small College.\ George has done a com- mendable job in presenting a pictme of life a:t Union through- out the length and IJI·eadth of the land, but our protagonist has gone to L'nion so many times now before alumni g1·oups and hig-h school audiences that he has l>ecome weary and no longer does he stimulate his admirers a;,; he did when he was in his pri::;tine glory. George is tired and needs assistance in canying on hi·s work. Let us then, g-ive George a helping hand and introduce new life into the Union productions by purchasing a movie camera. Such a camera would not only assist George, but would be of invalual>le assistance in many other respects. Founders' Day. Commencement exercises, pictorial scenes of the cam- pus and other events could be prese1·ved with such a camera. P1·ofessors, in the science divisions, especially, could supple- ment their lectures with movies of nem·l>y physical phenom- ena, engineering- processes and similar subjects. When our footl>all team plays away from home, the rival college inval'iabl~· records the game with a movie camera. OUI' cunent system of recording home games depends upon hasty observation and memorJ·, both of which a1·e poor sub- stitutes for a motion picture of the contest. :\Iovies of these games, as well as those of other infonnal campus \shot::;\ could be sent to alumni groups and would do much toward ::;trengthening alumni bonds to the College. In view of the fact that Union already has a projection machine we, speaking for poor George, suggest that a movie camera be purchased to aid him in his work. ON THE RECORD The record compiled by the va1·sity swimming team during the past season deserves mo1·e than a perfunctory statement announcing- that the squad won four and lost two of its six meets. It was a few ,rears ago that a gJ·mnasium wit pronounced the swimming season a success on the strength of the fact that \not a man was dro\vned during the whole season.\ It was not until February of 1938, the first year of \Joe\ Wheatley's incumbency as swimming coach, that The Con- cordiensis could announce to the Union student body that the swimming team had at last recorded a victory, thus breaking a three-year, 25-meet losing streak. Since the long awaited victory ln 1938, the team has won seven meets and has lost the same number, and under Coach Wheatley the gl'Oup has bl'Oken 24 college and pool records and has tied one marl<. Even in defeat, the team has broken existing records.

THIRD G£N£R.ATION G ENERAL Electric became a proud grandfather this year, when Charles E. Wilson became president and Philip D. Reed chairman of the board of directors- the third generation of G-E leaders. They will carry on as\ captain\ and \navigator\ of General Electric in place of Gerard Swope and Owen D. Young, who held these posi- tions from 1922 until their retirement at the first of this year. ;\Ir. Young and l\Ir. Swope leave behind them a brilliant record of achievement. Under their leadership General Electric iostered a great new branch of the electrical industry-the manuiacture of appliances which eliminate the drudgery of housework and create comforts and conveniences for the home. Through their efforts General Electric's many employee plans were achieved-old- age pensions and group life insurance, a wage-adjustmeht plan to meet increases in the cost of living, vacations with pay, an employee savings plan and many others- SIMPLIFIED BALANCING H ow about balancing a so-ton generator rotor turning at 36oo rpm? No, not on the end of your chin or anything like that, but balancing it until its v;bration is less than three ten-thousandths oi an inch- or one-tenth the diameter of a human hair! Not so easy, you say? Well, a little while ago you would have been right, for the balancing of a large rotating machine was a long-drawn-out procedure, perhaps re- quiring the removal oi the rotor from the machine. But today there is aG-E portable instrument that does the job simply, quickly, and under actual operating conditions. A 2o,ooo-kva synchronous condenser, for example, can sometimes be balanced in as few as three runs-a far cry from the roo to 170 trials which were frequently necessary before.

I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I The Clue that Trapped the Heirs of Huey Long O N THE MORNING OF JUNE 7, 1939, a hot tip came in to the city desk of the New Orleans States, evening newspaper sister of the famous Times-Picayune. When a truck drove up before a half-built house in the suburbs and began unloading window sash, the States' photographer was hiding behind a hedge. The picture he got touched off a string of giant firecrackers that blew hundreds of Louisiana politicos out of the public trough. ,... Fot the license plate proved that the truck be- longed to Louisiana State University-and the half- built house belonged to the wife of a colonel on the governor's staff. Just a drop in the bucket of graft that the political heirs of Huey Long had been passing around for years. But the first case that could be proved-libeiproof, airtight. That night 64-year-old Jim Crown, the States' fighting editor. sat down on his bed and sobbed- reaction from months without respite in the front- line editorial trenches. \At last we get a break!\ .,._ With the fuse once lit, the firecrackers kept pop- ping around the cowering Longsters. Three men committed suicide; more than 200 faced federal and state indictments. It had been a great spree, but thanks to the battling Picayune papers, it was all over. * * They\re in the great American tradition, the dig- nified old Times- Picayune and the rip-roaring, rough-and-tumble New Orleans States. They have a line behind them that reaches back to Ben Franklin and Sam Adams and Tom Paine. When Jim Crown strides around his office, dic- tating editorials at the top of his leather lungs, Greeley and Dana keep step with him. Pulitzer and Nast pound him on the back. And through him William Lloyd Garrison speaks again: \I am in earnest. I will not equivocate; I will not excuse; I will not retreat a single inch; and I will be heard!\ ,... Courage is probably, next to truth, the greatest quality that a newspaper can have. For the world abounds in forces. actions, events, and people be- fore which neither man, nor newspaper, nor the Newsmagazine, can be coldly objective. Silence, indifference, genteel or amiable omissions are not true impartiality-they are just what the forces of corruption or stupidity want, the broth in which they thrive. ,... TIME has never believed that icy indifference or \pure objectivity\ is either possible or desirable in news reporting. Any colorful, humanized story con· tains something of the mental attitudes and judg- ments of the men who wrote and edited it. But over and above this is the sense of height· ened responsibility that chara,cterizes these times, as it has other periods of crisis. These days are big with destiny for our country and the world. And the Newsmagazine in this era has a deep and pe· culiar responsibility. It is, in a sense, the national news- paper; it has the same obli- gation to all the people of the U.S. that the best dailies feel toward the people of their cities. That obligation means more than finding and condemning the things that are wrong. It also means finding and supporting the things that are right. .,._It's not so easy as it sounds. The world of right and wrong dresses in shades of gray. The pepper-and-salt of ordinary human na- ture ... the protective coloration of the rascal ••• the unprepossessing garments that can hide a clean white motive. lito- Studying that gray crowd-picture, penetrating its disguises. throwing a searchlight here and an X-ray there, is part of TIME's job. TIME queries its reporters and correspondents again and again: \What's behind this? lf\ho's behind it? Give us the background.\ TIME listens to people-all kinds of people, with all kinds of causes and crusades-bal- ances their ideas against events, against knowledge, horse sense. and plain old American morals. And sometimes when every possible scrap of fact, every line of expert and inexpert opinion is on the table, TIME editors still miss the last train home, trying to decide what's right. who's right, and how to let the people know it. Ill- Judgments arrived at this way are not infallible, for nothing human is. But they are genuinely re- sponsible. Essential to people who share TIME's attitudes-stimulating to people who don't. And backed by the courage of conviction. This is one of a series of advertisements in which the Editors of TIME hope to give all the readers of this newspaper a clearer picture of the world of news-gathering, news-writing, and news-reading-and the part TIME plays in help· ing you to grasp, measure. and use the history of your lifetime as you live the story of your life.

Under the exchange scholarship plan started in 1936, both insti t u- tions agreed to provide the ex- change students free room and board for the year they were study- .ng on the scholarship. Five Exchange Scholars The Union students who have held the scholarship are: George P. Haskell, '37, of Huron, S. D.; John Wold, '38 of Schenectady; Wallace F. Baker, '39, of Roches- ter, a member of the present sen- ior class at the college; Thomas H. Ralston, '40, of Brockway, Pa., and Lewis. These men were select- ed by a faculty committee which attempted to chosee the most out- standing and most representative member of the sophomore class who would study abroad his junior year. The Scottish students who have studied here on the international scholarship are: Clark Beckett in 1936; Brian S. T. Simpson, 1937; Andrew Dryburgh, 1938.; Edward A. F.

For some strange rea .. san thet·e is much le~s interest in di·plomacy than in greM mi1itaot'} activity. People seem to Hke the colot·, the military bands, and the thrills which they belive to exist or. the battlefield. It i~ essential, how· evet, to watch the .diplomatic front ~arefully. It ·is well to rPmem:bel• that di.plomacy brings m· silencer the ~ound of marching feet. Paasildvi, together with 1-{istc Rrti and two other Finnish offi· cia!;, is aga·in at the Kremlin. It i~ <1:il!icult to say who arranged the>e b.tcst negotiations. It seems ,af<' to assume that neither Finland not Russia appealed directly to the ent'my, for such an appea<l would be construed as a eign of weaknes£ which neithet· nation is willing to admit.

It will not be primarily the Allied attitude whicr will determine the outcome of these negotiations Their success will de- pend upcn the te1ms which Russia offers. At present they are harsher than those offet·ed before the war but if Russia is willing to make a concession on the point of Hangoe and indications are that she may be willing, they may 'be accepted The Finns have shown theil cour- 3ge: now they mul't save their ~ountiy. Von Ribbentrop has just con,fer· red with Mussolini and Ciano ir Italy. The Germans insist that t•hk was simply a customary visit plo- vided for under the Rome-Berlir axis.

Tickets fot· the presentation will be sold to local residents as well as to faculty members. Since the project has the warm endorsement of Presid.ent Fox and the Student Council and in view of the fact that the :\Iounte- I banks are cooperating by offering the extra showing of this ; play, it is not, certainly, asking too much to request that the student body join in the venture to the extent of advertising the project locally and by aiding in selling tickets the future of the \work scholarship\ plan will, in large measure, depend upon the success of this production.

The men elected include Richard Balch, Harry Crosby, W . Bradford Hastings, G. Dudley Hol- mes, John P. Lewi10, Roger Mar- shall, Clarence McCain, James Twining and Morris Weintraub. The Club, which had its origin as the English Club, was founded by Dr. Edward Everett Hale, Jr., Pro- fessor of English, in 1910. Under ing place for those students aud faculty members who were inter- Or. Hale the Club provided a meet- ested in creative writing, and its sessions wer·e devoted to reading of papers by members. In 1932, following thtl death of Dr. Hale, the Club was reorganized by Dr. Charles N. Waldrvn, and its name was changed to the Hale Club. Club meetings are hdd ap· proximately once a month either at the home of a faculty member or at one of the fraternity houses. Election to the organization i$ based upon the promise a candidate shows of becoming an \intereo;ting member.\ The newly elected members of th·~ Club will be invited to attend the next regular meeting, which is scheduled for Tuesday evening, March 26. Informal initiations will be held at that time. Krueger, Quinlan Allouette Singers: Ralston To Be Historian Erne:;t W. Bodenstab, President ,0f the Senior· Class, today an- nounced the appointment of John, .J. Quinlan and William C. Krueger, both of Schenectady, as the alouette singers for this year's performance' of the traditional ceremony. A.t the :;arne time the appointment uf rhomas Ralston, of Brockway, 1:-'a., as class historian was disclosed. BUl'dick H. Brittin, Bayonne, N.J., is in charge of the planning and sale ·of progr·ams and announce- ments for this year's class, Boden-· stab said. Bodenstab also stated that a new procedure will be f0llowed for the' annual jug ceremony on Class Day. in Jackson's Gardens. In order to· insure that the contents of the jug are sampled by a larger num- ber of the members of the clus.il than in previous years, no single Keeper of the Jug will be appoint- ed, as has, been the custom .In- stead Bodenstab will later select a large committee to handle a larger number of jugs than has been the custom and thus guarantee them speedy and extensive passage o: the nectar. Events Scheduled for Class Day A new method of presentation of the alouette verses, lampooning weaknesses and foibles of the grad- uating class, has already been dis- closed by Bodenstab. The Moving· Up Day ceremonies will take place in the last two chapel periods of the year. The alouettes will be sung on Class Day before the more for- mal portions of the ceremony around the Nott Elm, Jr., in eithel' the Memorial Chapel or Hanna Hall. The class historian writes a his- tot·y of the class's four years to be presented at the Class Day exer- cises.

President Fox Greets Sub-Freshman Guests To our visitors: We hope that you, each of our visitors, this week-end will sense the genuine and hearty welcome that the whole College extends to you. We have not tried to put on a special show. You are seeing Union at its daily round of serious work and wholesome play. We hope that you will come again when Nature unites a lit- tle more warmly on our hundred acres, when Jackson's Garden is in bloom, when the sheep are grazing in the pastures, when the ancient lawns are smoothly green and the elms are shading the College lanes. Memoirs of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries cluster about our library and buildings; we are proud of them, but we trust you will not find us too complacent or too backward- looking in our spirit. As you look upon the portra-its of our worthies of times past you may be assured that we intend to have more of them in the future. Among Union's great graduates of the twentieth century some of you visitors may ultimately find your own place. But whether or not you be- come Union College .men you ar., very welcome guests today or any time.

Issue Editors .................................... The Senior Board A~sistant .............................. . . . . . J. Ruppett Friday, Ma1ch 15, 1940 -30- A:-; we prepare to ascend the steps of our ivory tower for the la::;t time to w1·ite the farewell message of the 1·etiring Senior Board we are confronted, all too suddenly \vith the realization that this i::; to l>e the rnost difficult editorial we have been called on to compose. It would be an easy matte1·, we thought, to bequeath to the ne\\' board the t:u;k of editing the paper. The 3 a. m., and even all night sessions of \putting the Concordy to bed,\ the rlays without lunch to supe1·vise press work, the problem of \making-up\ an issue that would have defied the effo1·ts of an architect, and the innumem.ble times when bl'idge, basketball games, movies and even studies had to l>e over- looked in favor of the pap.er,-all this to see the finished pro- duct discarded in two minutes with the statement \There's nothing in this is::;ue.\ \\Vhy we asked ourselves twice a week, ''does a sane student eve1· think of going out for a col- lege paper'?\ ~ow, however, as we close our three yeal' association with the activity which we sincerely believe is the finest on the campus-the activity which to many of us will be Union Col- lege-our sole regret is that our incumbency has been lim- ited to three years. :\lemories of our never-to-be-forgotten associations with Ralph Cohen, \By\ Enzer, Bob Ferguson, Carl Trahma.n, Fred Hequembourg and the many others who have become Concordiensis legends make us all the more re- luctant to say adieu. The \headaches\ of the past seem in- consequential now as we recall the pride which was ours when the paper came rolling from the press, or when ,.,.e saw some tangible contribution which The Concordiensis had made to the College. The interminable \bull sessions,\ the discussions with such men as Lewis Sebring and Gt·over Loud will make our association with The Concordiensis an unfor- gettable one. The newly elected editors have our heartie&>t congratula- tions and sincere wishes for their success. It has been be- cause of the efforts of these men in the past that The Con- cordiensis remains one of the few small college publications which issue a six column paper semi-weekly and it has been their cooperation which has, on several occasions, made our deadline \anytime before we go to press\ while many of our contemporary campus organs must have all news from one to three days before the date of publication. :May the new board profit by our many errors. And so, after a last wistful survey from our lofty tower, we grudgingly bid au revoir to three years of fond mem- ories, turn the reins over to our successors, and trudge down the path to join the ranks of the campus has-beens.

THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MARCH 15, 1940 Page Three A PECK OF SPORTS BQX,ING; WRESTLING ON CARD TONIGHT While in our last bul:l ses- sion with Hail Wittne1· as sports editor of this \rag the honorable director of ath- letics received a long distance telephoae caH from a man Named Little. EavesdroppiNg, as usual, our deduction was that he was speaking with Lou Little of Columbia Uni- versity but our guess was wrong, also as usua:J. George Little, director of athletics at Rutgers University, was phoning to find if UnioH had an open date il'l football next season because, if that was the case, Rutgers would very rnuch like to entertain Union in its stadium. There are no open dates, of course .... And now to atone for a point we have neglected for the past ten months-that is, the se- lection of Union's most loyal supporter. The titles goes to Frank \Baldy\ Palmer, fre- quent visitor at the gymnas- ium, who misses very few Union contests whethel' they are played here or away. And thus we officially con- cluded a ten-months incum- bency as sports edito1· of this newspapet'. A term in which all associations have been very pleasant-a feature of our college career ( ?) we'll al- ways cherish. The names of those who have cooperated with this corner in an effort to make these particular six columns interesting during the past year would easily fill the entire page, let alone this one column. So may we ex- tend a bli\nket vote of thanks to the coaches, the captains, all the members of all the teams, that member of the faculty who has taken the time and trouble to clip items from other papers which might be used in this pillar, and a final expression of gratitude to Union's athletic director. Sincerely, we are grateful to all who have help- ed \lS assume this position to the best of our ability. For- tunately, a position of writing sports for a local newspaper will prevent a complete break · with these very pleasant as- sociations. 14 Mat Strugg'le.s; Nine Ring Tests To Entertain About 150 Sub-Frosh Heavyweight Grappling Tussles, First Slugfests Arouse lnterestj Krull to Meet Doug Boynton A . . <i>--------------- ppl'OXImateiy 150 ::;ub-frcshmen will see theit· first Union College aid Geisel, 130, Sigma Chi; Lou athletic event tonight as they are Semenoff, 141, Oldgym, vs. Phil entertained at quarter-finals and Westlake, 144;:,, Kappa Sigma; Bob semi-linals of the intramural box- Campchero, 138, vs. \Doc\ Ort0n, mg and wrestling tournament 140, Chi Psi; AI Hubbard, 142, Alpha wnich boasts a heavy card of 14 D.elta Phi, vs. Bob Dake, 139, Phi wrestling matches and nine boxing Sigma Kappa; Bruce Scidmore 152 bouts.

Tiebout, '42. who has played impoztant role>< for the Mountebanks, was elected a mem- ber of the Mountebanks executive committee and wi 1 I be stage man- ager and scene designer for the Prom play. The Mountebanks are cons:dering three playE' for the production: \The Male Animal,\ by Jame\ Thui ber and Elliot Nugent, a play about college life which is now on Broadway and for which non-pro- fessional .performing rights are being sought, \The Father,\ a comedy by William Dunlap, and \The Bad Man,\ a comedy-drama of the Mexican border, by Porter Emerson Browne. Prom Night Prest'ntation Definite decision on the choice of a play will be made by tomorrow or Thursday anci announced In assembly before casting-tryouts. Since the next play will be pre- sented May 3, 4 and May 11 (Prom nightl, and the Spring vacation intervenes, there is little time tc be last before casting, scene con- t'truction and rehearsals get unde.r way, James P. Barford, '40, presl· dent and production manager of the Mounte.banlts, said last night. Bar ford also pointed out that \The Pursuit of Happiness\ will re- quire that the present cast keep it in rehearsal because of the strong possibilities of a road trip includ- ing engagements in RocheS'ter ~nd Buffalo. Elwin W. Hannock, 40, business manager of the Mounte- banks, is negotiating with sponsors in these cities and word has al- r·eady ·been received from ~oches­ ter which leads to the bellef that a perfm mance will be give~ there about April 5, with a tentahve pet- formance scheduled for Buffalo on April 6. --·---o---- T wenty Students Signed For Summer Camp Jobs Over twenty Union men ha;e. al- ready signed up to take posihons as counselors in summer camps, Miss Frances Trav,is, Director of Student Empl'oyment rep01ted. Miss Travis explained that the bureau is ma:ldng a concerted effort to get summer positions for needy stu- dents. Last yPar· more than a sco:e of Union men were placed rn camps and hotels for the sun;mer. The possibility that there will ~e mote .positions open to students I.n summer hotels exists, Miss Travis stated because of improved business conditions. The most important re- ouii emen t for employment is pre- ~ious experience. The college will not employ Un- ion stud·ents for work on the re- building of the athletic field, ~iss Travis said since the resurfacmg is being don'e by a contractor, hir~d by the college, who will employ his own labor. AgriculttU'e Work Possibllity Last year several Union men a~­ plied to the Department o! Agri- culture for employment wrth the units w01king to erradicate the Dutch Elm disease and to control the Japanese Beetle. However none were employed because the de~art­ ment aave its positions to Yale Univer;ity men, Miss Travis stated. Indications are that the Agriculture nepal tment will spread its .s~mer work, awarding opportunrtres to several colleges and the Employ- ment Bureau is taking applications in anticipation. \Men employed on these jobs wm have to live away hom home all summer and be re- quired to pay trans~.ort~tlon fror_n one job to another.

Boyt, '42, to make the Mountebanks' production, \The Pursuit of Happ•iness,\ a success. Yet due to Boyt, serious doubt existed as to whether the play could be given last week- end. Thursday night Boyt was rushed to Ellis Hospital with symptoms of appendicitis. The Mountebanks. casting for someone to take the part with a day's notice since there was no understudy, called Stanley Green, '43, from his fraternity meeting.
