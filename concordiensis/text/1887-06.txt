VOL. X. UNION COLLEGE, JUNE 20, 1887. No. U. Class Day Oration. (E. M. H.A WKES.) THE same · dissatisfied aspiration for achieve1neid, ·which for centuries has been active, to-day :forms the controlling pur- pose of men. It assu1nes the forms-· thirst for knowledge, again hope of literary renown, desire for political power, greed for money, love of pleasure. Science, philosophy, mer- cantile pursuits, and other professions have each their followers. Against opposition and disappointment they press on over every obsta- cle, renewing their fainting courage by the promise of the prize to be attained, .and so height after height is passed until they reach the longed-for sun1mit. . We aspire :for success; yet, when once attained, that which from afar appeared so vital to our existence has forever lost its savor. Wealth allures youth. Desire £or its . attainment becomes the guidil1g rein to all his aspirations, turns him hither and thither through paths now o£ honor and again of dishonor, curbs every opposing sentiment of his nature to increase his speed towards the desired goal. The prize is reached. Wealth, that in anticipation had been tens, he realizes as hundreds, yet it brings not the promised blessings. He has given· all to this attain- ~ent, but how gladly woulcl he now give up • lns golden treasures to exchange places 'vith the comrade long since outdone in the wor- ship of Ma1nmon. He sees this former com pan ion blessed by the love of his family, eager in kindness towards his fellow -men, honored by all ; sees his happy face-an index that Hfe without wealth need not be a failure. He looks back over their earlier lives, where he has tram- pled under foot all that might have Jed to the others present enjoyment, where his friend has spurned the practices that have brought him wealth. He is dissatisfied, un- happy. Even the glitter of his gold adds to his wretchedness, as it brings 1nany recollec- tions he would gladly :forget. And so in other fields. The past has had its Grothe and its Byron, pre-eminent in mind, in position, in wealth, and in fame; but their li-ves were the more wretched and withered becauseof their greatness. Surely then money, knowledge, fame are not success. Reason and experience atteRt that human nature has grander parts and a ~1igh:r destiny. The an1bition, whose prompt- Ings 1n men take such different forms, springs from within. It is implanted by God, and God nevpr gave the race this a1nbition with- out supplying the n1eans of satisfying it. Success is not meant for the fortunate few it ' is within the reach of all. Wealth, knowl- edge and fame exist external to the man him- self, they can not satisfy an inner craving. A personal end al()ne can constitute success; and personality finds its highest realization in character. Success is character. To this all other ends n1ust give way and as from day to day our characters become stronger, as we can review our decision at this or that crisis ' can see whe1·e 've have strengthened virtue at· the expense o£ less worthy aims, we need

We . have here but been \scoring\ for our places in the race of life! The final \Go\ that shall announce the start in this long race is form- ing upon the starter's lips. The spectators rise from their seats and strain their eyes to . see who has the lead as the racers break away from the starting line. Yet, attach as much interest as we may to it, t~is is but the start, and there is no assur- ance that those who have gained first places in the ''scoring\ will hold the lead to the \finish. n True, they are already that much nearer the goal, but in this race, their \bottom their staying qualities are of mo1·e account than a little advantage at the start. It is no 100 yard dash where the start is everything, but a race of thirty or forty years, where every faculty shall have opportunity for its fullest development and most effective work. Social position, influential friends, or fortu- nate opportunities may help some o£ us to first places during the first ten years of the race, but the succeeding· twenty or thirty years will d0tern1ine who of us possess those sterling qualities which make opportunities, and win social position and influence. Time will reverse many a hastily given verdict, : correct many a long cherished opinion. Such, fello·w-classmates, are the. prospects which lie before us in the epoch upon whose -threshold we to-day stand. As we take a ] ingering look over the last four years, let us refuse to see in them anything that shall mar the pleasure or disturb the harmony o£. our future contact as a class.

Prophecy. BY N. J. G-ULICK. I F any m~~ber of a c~Hege class i.s u~:t£or­ tunate, 1t 1s he who 1s asked by his class- nlates to prophesy. All agree that prophets are called and that the age of calling the1n is past. _ But after spending four years together in preparation for life's work and standing upon the very threshold of diffusing our influence among all men, there arises an irre- pressible desire to conjecture in regard to the future if we can know nothing more. vV e are not likely to see ourselves as otheTs see us and theTsfore necessity demands that some humble victi1n be selected £rom the class, whose power o£ imagination runs high and who is ready i:f need be to endure perse- secution for the revelation which has been made to him for the good of his classmates. Being simply tl1e medium through which this knowledge o£ the future o£ '87 is com- municated, I am neither responsible for any disappointment which may pain the heart of some anxious listener nor for any thrill of rapture that may overcome the faint hearted. You are to hear in plain words the circum- stances under which the revelation was made and also in simple detail the words of prophecy. I shall ne-ver forget the day 'vhen these strange words o£ propheey were made known to me. It was one of the ideal days in the latter part of May.

Those of us familiar with the brief and· irrelevant manner in which these our · class- mates are accustomed to resp0nd to a pro- fessor's question, will be doubtless surprised when we fully realize their flow of 1\~ords to- night. Classn1ates, on this last occasion when we as a class shall come before the people of Schenectady, we n1ust he truthful. We must claim for the brothers who address us · no greatei' power than that. which they have always manifested. We must conclude that · the memories of college life, the golden ·chord of friendship which binds together the members of our class, and the bright l1'opes in which our fancy permits us to indulge, have proved ~n inspiration snffi.cient to make ~ire dumb speak. Your addresser has been perplexed in his efforts to choose a theme for this occasion. During the year he has faithfully attended the Friday morning rhetoricals, hoping that somewhere, in the chain of human knowl- . edge, theTe would be left for him one un- . touched link. He has been disappointed. The members o£ the Junior class, fresh from the study of political economy, have again and again uttered in our hearing familiar words and doctrines which had, as many times before, kept the members o£ our class fron1 the sea- sonable enjoyment o£ their mid-day meal. Junior orators, by a single word or brief sentence, have torn do·wn institutions which man, aided by the Divine Hand, has strug- glecl £or ages to establish. In their beautiful imagery they have placed within the easy reach o£ humanity a state of society for which the world may be ready in a thousand years. . Those of the class fortunate enough to re- ceive the sustaining six in logic have com- pelled the world to accept theories which no11e but an unnatu·ral mind could contrive. We believe that the fame of the great orators o£ Greece and Ro1ne, the· glory of the grand speakers who have moulded English and American history, will be outshone by the lights o:f eighty-eight. \\Vith feelings o£ disappointment less bitter only than those which he experiences when refused a second piece of pie, he turned sadly away from the realm usurped by another class. Having the utmost confidence in the inability of his own classmates, he has approached their fields o£ research. Again he has been deceived. There is no height in morality to which his classmates in their flights o£ eloquence have not soared. There is no depth in philosophy, which their minds have not fathomecL ·

As members of the intellectual woTld, we wol'ship at the sln·ine of knowledge. As individuals in the moral world ~we have a higher duty. When, then, we contemplate the value o£ a college education to us, we must regard not only that intelligence with which it crowns us, but that higher gift of wisdom with which we are to crown the worlds. Brothers in eighty-seven, your addresser £rankly tells you to-night that he believes the principles of morality to be firmly seated in the bosoms of his class rna tes.

No ordi11ary mind has_ large enough calibre to grasp the whole idea o£ the effect of our class upon its individual members, the college and the world.

This society which was founded in 1886 at Cornell university has already chapters in a number of the colleges and universities o£ the Eastern and Middle states and is being rapidly extended a1nong the best institutions of the country. Its rapid growth during the last year is evidence of the need of such a society, and a pledge o£ the standing which it is soon to take among collegiate honorary societies. In its general character the society is comparable to Phi Beta Kappa. It is, however, a scientific and engineering soci~ty, and only students in those courses are eligible for Tegular Inem- bership. Since scientific and engineering courses have become so general a1nong the colleges o£ this country there has been felt a need of some society which should have £or its object the recognition of superior attainn1ent o£ students in these courses and the furtherance of scientific study and inves- tigation. The above are arnong the objects of the Sigma Xi Society members of the \ ,

The college has a great deal of property at H uuter's Point. Part o£ it is improved. J:t is burde11ed by a debt and taxation that exceeds $300,000. The improved. property suffers from that in- cumbrance and yet is worth a great deal 1nore than that sum. Our unjncumbered property there consists of 1,400 vacant lots. We have to pay taxes on that, the interest on our debts and support our establishment here. Now the property at Hunters Point was enveloped in a trust and we have extri- cated it. We have not sold the property yet because the market has not been right. But I believe that Dr. Nott's prediction of 30 years ago is about to be realized. The time is coming when New Yorkers will want this property.
