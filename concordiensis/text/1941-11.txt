The trustees suggested a few minor changes in the new c0nstitution, which establishes the revised form of govern men t, thus delaying slightly the final complete accept- ance of the new constitution. Under the new constitution all l~egislative powers of the faculty are intrusted to a committee made up of the president, the dean, the chairman of the divisions, two rep- resentatives elected from each division and three from the faculty at large, making seventeen in alL Chairmen of the divisions are to be nominated by the division groups to the trustees for three year terms. The faculty must meet at least three times yearly, ·but its func- tion will be confined to balloting for representatives and for student prize awards. Time will also be spent in general discussion. The committee on education must meet at least monthly to pass any meas- ures appertaining to educational policy.

The presentation 0f the Union Song will be made in l'esponse to a petition circulated by The Concordiensis and signed by nearly all members of the stu- dent body. President Fox also urged the presentation of the song in a letter to Mr. Waring, as did the Capital District repre- sentative for Chesterfields, whose manufacturers sponsor the pro- gram, and W. James Stillman, '42. Confirmation was received last week in a telegram from Mr. Waring, who wired, \We expect to perform at least one Union College song on November Sev- enth in cooperation with your celebration\ The Concordiensis mailed War- ing's advertising agency 50 cop- ies of a medley of Union songs on October 22. Union Alumni Run For Office Today Sigma Phi, Kappa Sigma Lead Fraternity Sales; Neutral Returns Lag With two fl·aternities, Kappa Sigma and Sigma Phi, leading the way, ticket sales for the Inter- fiaternity Ball have reached the highest point in two years for this time preceeding the ball. Both Kappa Sigma and Sigma Phi will have more than 95';{ of their mem- bers in attendance. Eight fraterni- ties have better .than 50'/(, and the remaining range from 26~{ to 50<;!. Acol'ding to Benjamin T. Leland, chairman of the ticket committee, neutral ticket sales are behind former years. Leland urged all neutrals who wish to attend to buy their tickets immediately. He em- phasi:wd thai the dance was an all-college function for both neu- tral and fraternity men. Neutrals may purchase their tic- kets from Alexander Maxwell, North College; James Stillman, South College; James McNulty, Oidgym Hall and Alexander Arony, at large. Tickets may also be ob- tained at the bookstore and from Mrs. Briggs at Hale House. The price will go up tomonow at noon fi·om $3.30 to $4.40. Made more exciting by the en- couraging ticket sales, the week is fast drawing toward Friday night when Union will dance to the rhy- thms of Sonny Dunham and his orchestra. Featured with this band, termed \the fastest rising band in the country,\ will be the \Ball Bag- atelle\ and the famous \Storm of Colors.\ About the Band The Dunham aggregation, with handsome Ray Kellogg on the \'ocals, promises to include in its selection of pieces mostly slow, At least five Union graduates danceable music.

Its exhibition of marching up and down the rain-swept gridiron, blo·w- ing away for dear life in the face of weather that had driven most of the 1500 other souls to sheltel', was one of the grandest we have seen. Then, there is the performance of the men who spent approximately two and one-half hours cheering on the Garnet squad in a ceaseless torrent of rain.

THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS \All the wol'ld's a stage, And all the rnen and women merely players : They have their exits and their entrances;\ How well this quotation ~tpplies to out· De- mocracy of today! We profess government under a democratic s~;stem, whereby each man and each woman enters om· drama of politics upon reaching his, m· her, twenty- first birthday. And as long as ,,.e choose to participate, we may act om· parts, bowing out only when we feel unwilling to perform any fur-ther. Of the thousands of actors that have graced our political stage since its erection shortly afte1· the Revolution, there are only a score who can l..Je classified as truly great -the greatest of whom are Washington. Jackson and Lincoln. Schooled under the democratic process, they entered thei1· most prosperous period of life not only willing, but what is more essen- tial, al..Jle to serve the people .... Their per- formances \Vere unsurpassed, the recognition of their accomplishments unequalled .... Each had taken the stage when Drama was at a lull; each took his leave when it had reached its zenith. The college student may ask why these great actors achieved such pre-eminence- and the answe1· may be found l..Jy a study of theil· individual ch~u·acters. All three possessed an unquenchable thirst fo1· accomplishment and advancement. All three knew that a Christian character, sup- plemented by a vast supply of information, was all important. Now, because scores of years have rolled by, the student should not believe that his condition is incomparable to that of Wash- ington's, Jackson's and Lincoln's. For today, as then, the world at large, and America in particular, is torn with strife and discontent ·-drama has sunk to a new low. Today's acto1·s have rendered a pel'form- ance that hardly warrants applause. Insin- cere in their delivery, and intriguing in their manne1·, they have clouded the stage with their inadequacy. As in other times, when that darkness was lig-hted by g-reat acting, so in years to come may our clouds be cleared by us, students of today, but leaders of tomorrow. Such cannot l..Je the case, however, if we find ourselves as inadequately trained as our predecessors. So let us prepare ourselves in the present for the future, fellow students, by a consci- entious application to our studies and to the ways of a Christian life, so that when the curtain rises, we shall find ourselves able to act om· parts as Washington, Jackson and Lincoln acted theirs. -RAYMOND E.

It stands beside the Nott Memorial library which was completed while Arthuz was President of the United States and looks towat·d Jackson's Garden, cultivated when Arthur was in college by his mathematics teacher, Professor Isaac W. Jack- son. l~xercises Yesterday Though an original work, the statue samewhat resembles that by Gecrge K Bissell now in Madison Squ..tt e il'l New York City.

Furthermore, the sport as it extds today has the approval of near!) nine out of every ten college stu- dents. Only 5 pet· cent of the nation's collegians would substitute the big- time games with an intramural program, it is found in a study con- ducted by Student Opinion Surveys of America.

(Continued on Page 4) When he came to office, President Arthur was considered \a mere wire pullet, a pot house politician, safely buried in the vice presidency. His only interest it was thought had been that as many citizens of New York as possible voted the Republican ticket and that local party leaders obeyed the voice of Roscoe Conkling,\ Dr. Fox said. He continued: \The murder of President Garfield, a few months after his succession, brought Ar- thur, in heavy reluctance, to the executive direction of a nation. As to his record then we may take the genet al judgment of a compe- tant historian, Harry Thurston Peck, writing 20 years later: 'From tl;e outset, he was president of no faction, no party, but of the people, firm, wise and vigilant, his ad- ministration was one of the very best irt all our history.\ Emily Post Assures Worl'ying Mothers ;That Go.od Girls Are In Good Hands By EMILY POST \To the mothers who are in- of clothing recommended by Mrs. clined to fear that it cannot ·be Post for Friday's tea dancing along proper for their daughters to stay \Fmternity Row\ or at the formal in fraternity houses, it should be gym dance, nor Saturday's repeti- explained: House-Party Week has tion of Friday nor for Sunday been an accepted custom for gen- dinner and travel. erations in colleges and fraternities A FPw Warnings. \Don't arrive that have always upheld highest with a shab-by down-at-the-heel moral standards.

A man's fraternity usually means everything to him, and If he gives a girl his official pin he must think a great deal of her.\ At least 325 couples have crowded into the gym this evening to par- ticipate in Union's fall tribute to the football team-the Gridiron I Ball. They have just raised their 1 voices to cheer for a Union victory over the University of Rochester tomorrow afternoon. The novel Ball Bagatelle will be held, at ·which time Sonny Dunham will pick a fraternity name from hi,; brass derby and award the lucky young lady representing that fra- ternity house a football auto- graphed by eve1y member of the varsity squad. In addition she will receive a gift for every gi-rl weekending in that fraternity house. The drawings will be made at the one o'clock intermission-- SONNY DUNHAI\-1 Chaplain To Live In Silliman Hall Dr. Fox Points Out Building Again Center Of Christian Life Pointing out the error of an item carried in the Scene column of to- night's paper, President Fox in a statement to The Concordiensis said: \I think we owe an explan- ation to the campus as to why, at a time when college expenditures must be closely iimited, we are turning the third -floor of Silliman Hall into a residential apartment. The financial answer is that the money so invested will bring as good a return through rent as the avera:ge productive investment on our books. Silliman Hall Y. M. C. A. \When Sillim~::n Hall was given to the college it was stipulated that it be used to forward Christian life· on the Union College campus. For a time the secretary of the college Y. M. C.

Now to install the Cha-plain and his wife in the new apartment, in the expectation that they will receive a good many student callers seems to the trus- tees in line with their obligation.\ ----0>---- Classical Club Meeting The Classical Club will meet Tuesday evening at 7:45 p. m. in the home of Professor George Kel- log,. near the Nott Street gate. Professor Coffin will speak en \The Inns and Taverns of An- tiquity.\ hour and a half away. Photography Booth Union was quick to take advan- tage of the photography booth, rushing the photographer in an effort to see \the mugs\ and to take a pictme which might be sent home to parents or shown to other gil'is. As might be expected, some of the pictures have been hilarious. Guests first began arnvmg shortly after lunch today. A Con- cordiensis survey begun this eve- ning has as ytt failed to find the first girl to arrive on the campus. Dates came by every means of transportation, train, bus, car, taxi, plane, interurban and theit· own feet. The nearest guest carne from Schenectady, the farththerest from Hollywood, Califomia. The evening began with the fra- ternity dinners some of which were either preceded or followed with cocktail parties. At 7:15 tonight Fred Waring played the \Ode to Old Union,\ the alma mater, on his Chesterfield program over the National Broadcasting Company's Red Network. Waring was pre- vented from playing more Union music because of the award made him. Dance Begins at 10 Couples assembled early in the gym and at 10 p. m. sharp Sonny Dunham swung into his first note. At 11:30 p. m.-a few moments ago -dancers engaged in an all out rally for the football team. Head Cheerleadet· John Bass, '42·, led the eheering. Following the rally the football team left the floor as Art Lawrence, head coach, has given them permission to remain at the ball only until 12-midnight. The girls who will represent the fraternities at the Bagatelle draw- Ing are: Jean Smith, Alpha Delta Pbi; Ada Tiberio, Alpha Phi.

Delta Theta; Shirley Wendell, Phi Gamma Delta; Annette Kaplan, Phi Sigma Delta; Kathleen Mar- tin, Phi Sigma Kappa; Alice Enska, Psi Upsilon; Shirley Gover, Sigma Chi; Eleanor Weller, Sigma Chi, and Lorenz Bagley, Theta Delta Chi. \Storm of Color\ Five men spent nine hours of ;vork setting up the 3,000 pounds of electrical equipment for the \Storm of ·Color.\ Dancers have termed the lighting effect odd be- cause \you see light and darkness.\ Chairman of the Interfraternity Council and Ball, Fred Wikoff, '43, pointed out that 300,000 mirrors were used to obtain the \night club\ atmosphere of the affair. Dancers congratulated Wikoff on staging one of the best Interfra- ternity dances ver held on the Union campus. Tomorrow Union will attend the football game and then engage in a round of house party dances. At this point, tomorrow seems in the distant ages to come. All ques- tioned said that they were having \the time of our life.\

This progmm is one of establi~h­ ing a \l\Ianager's Council\ of fFatemity pur- chasing agents, for the purpose of effectiHg sweeping purchase economies for the several houses. The proposals embodied in this program were worked out by Concordiensis investiga- tors who spent several weeks on the subject of commodity pUl'chasing by the several fra- ternities. They are: ( 1) That the Interfmternity Council es- tablish as an org·anization subsidiary to itself a council of house managers and stewards. (2) That this managers' council make it its business to see that every house manager is aquainted with the economy techniques of every other house. ( :n That this managers' council investi- g· t.l' further the opportunities for economy nmcng the various Schenectady sou1·ces of supply. (.1) That this managers' council consider itself responsible for the further investig·a- tion of the practicability of community buy- ing· at Union. (:>) That this managers' council put into practice immediately any communal buying methods as soon as they are found worth- while, no matter how far these methods may be from the eventual goal: community buy- ing· in every pt·actical way. To implement this investigation, The Con- cordiensis will, in the near future, sponsor a Houndtable on Commodity Cooperation, to which intere:::;ted students and faculty mem- bers will be invited. POLLS OF STUDENT OPINION Printed in tuday's Cunco1 diensis is the second in the series of polls of student opin- ion which are ueing taken by this newspapel' in conjunction with the Student Opinion Surveys of Ame1·ica. Some one hundred fifty undergraduate newspapers now participate in these surveys which have approximately the accuracy of the lm·gel' scale Gallup polls. They V·:ill, dur- ing the course of the year, investigate ques- tions of impm-t to Union students, ranging from the issue of subsidization of college athletics to that of neutrality. TO OUR GUESTS ! ln addition to student opllllOII in genPrnl, The Concordiensis is cooperating with tht' Yale ~ews in investigating opinions held by members of the editol'ial staffs of many of the college pnpers of the nation on the sub- jects uf declaration of wal', neut1·a!ity, and the arming of merchant ships. That we are able tu sponsor such pulls IJr.Hg~; a diotinet sense of gratification; when we make such surveys we m·e again l.Huught to 1·ecognize that we live in the only nation in the world today in which l,SOO,OOO college men and women may freely express their views. SEVE,NTY HOURS OF PLEASURE Fred Waring's song greeting to Union earlier this evening sounded the keynote to the seventy hours of Interfratemity \Veek- end pleasure which lie before you. The wel- come with which the campus greets all of its three hundred fair guests, whose presence is chief reason fo1· the being of this entire event, was most adequately demonstrated to you this afternoon by your individual hosts. We trust that your trip to the college was satisfactory and that you arrived in time for the special dinners planned by many of the fraternities. You have already danced to Sonny Dunham's music and have had vary- ing reactions to the strange lighting effects achieved in the Storm of Colors decoration motif. The rest of the Interfraternity dance, the Ball Bagatelle, the Union-Rochester foot- ball game, the house parties, the picnics and a host of other affairs remain before you. Perhaps the most unusual event which you have thus far observed-and in which you have participated~is the spirit rally which has just ended. Tonight's dance honors Union's football team and the spirit that you noted is typical of the splendid support which the student body has given its team. Inci- dentally, the two most popular cheers are the sing-song and the locomotive-and they are easily leamed before 2 tomorrow. Y uu may find yom escort full of activity. Don't blame him for that-he has only two chances a year to show off his colleg·e, and lnterfratemity Week-end has come early enough this year so that many of the natural beauties of the campus may still be observed and enjoyed. The spirit of good fellowship that you see at tonight's dance will be even more fully emphasized on Saturday at houseparties. If your escort shows signs of staying at his own party all night and you want to get an even fuller picture of the college, talk him into using some of his bids and into going to parties at other houses. Just to reciprocate, let him talk you into seeing the college gar- dens, if they are open, during houseparties- even if you saw them Ball night. Sunday's lunch cannot be any but a happy meal even if you must leave directly after it. You'll be too tired to care about anything mo1·e than your feeling of happiness. Right now, as you return to Sonny Dun- ham's music, Union wants you to know that it is great having you all with us-and that you all look beautiful. HAVE A GOOD TIME!! EDITORIAL 2 Dean Is Administrat,ive Head Of Academic Side of (o.llege By HOBERT HAYNER ~ \All the busine\s having to do i with the academic side uf the cuHege is done by us,\ Dean Cl:atle\ F. F.

Most of Union's undergraduates are familiar with such things as eligibility but how about schedules? The a'bsence of conflicts and its whole smooth-running structme i·s a source of a good deal of amaze- ment to people who have done any schedule making at all. \When I came here, there was no such thing as the schedule of classes we have now,\ Dean Gari~ answered. \It was a hit or miss affair which was very unsuccessful and I was the first to undertake the making of a new one, prin- cipally because no one else wanted to try it.

This program is one of e~tabli~h­ ing .a \;\lanager's Council\ of fraternity pur- chasing agents, for the purpose of effecting sweeping purchase economies for the sevel'Hl houses. The proposals embodied in this program were worked out by Concordiensis investiga- tors who spent several weeks on the subject of commodity purchasing by the seveml fra- ternities. They are: (1) That the Interfraternity Council es- tablish as an organization subsidiary to itself a council of house managers and stewards. (2) That this managers' council make it its business to see that every house manag·er is aquainted with the economy techniques of every other house. ( :n That this rnanag'ers' council investi- g- 1 ,e further the opportunities for economy amcng the various Schenectady sources of supply. ( -1) That this manag·ers' council consider itself responsible for the further investiga- tion of the practicability of community buy- ing at Union. ( :>) That this managers' council put into practice immediately any communal buying methods as soon as they are found worth- while, no matter how far these methods may be from the eventual goal: community buy- ing in every practical way. To implement this investigation, The Con- coediensis will, in the near future, sponsor a Roundtable on Commodity Coopemtion, to which intere:sted :students and faculty mem- ben; will be invited. POLLS OF STUDENT OPINION Printed in today's Cuncordien:sis i::; the second in the series of poll::; of ::;tuclent opin- ion which are lleing taken by thi::> newspaper in conjunction with the Student Opinion Surveys of Amel'ica. Some one hund1•ed fifty undergraduate newspapel'::l now participate in the::;e ::;urvey::; which have approximately the accmacy of the large1· scale Gallup polls. They will, dur- ing the course of the year, investigate ques- tions of import to Union students, ranging from the issue of subsidization of college athletics to that of neutrality. TO OUR GUESTS ! In addition to student op11110n in gem'l'al, The Concm·diensis is cooperating- with the Yale ;-{ews in investigating opinions held hy memuel':l uf the editorial staffs of many of the college paper::; of the nation on the sub- jects of declaration of war, neutrality, and the arming of 111el'Chant ::;hips. That we are able to sponsor such polls lJr.ug::; a Jistiud sense of gratification; when we make such surveys we are again brought to 1·ecognize that we live in the only nation in the \vol'ld today in which 1,500,000 college men and women may freely express their views. SEVENTY HOURS OF PLEASURE Fred Wa1·ing's song greeting to Union earlier this evening sounded the keynote to the seventy hours of Interfraternity Week- end pleasure which lie before you. The wel- come with which the campus greets all of its three hundred fair guests, whose pi·esence is chief reason for the being of this entire event, was most adequately demonstrated to you this afternoon by your individual ho.sts. We trust that your trip to the college was satisfactory and that you arrived in time for the special dinners planned by many of the fraternities. You have already danced to Sonny Dunham's music and have had vary- ing 1·eactions to the strange lighting effects achieved in the Storm of Colors decoration motif. The rest of the Interfraternity dance, the Ball Bagatelle, the Union-Rochester foot- ball game, the house parties, the picnics and a host of other affairs remain before you. Perhaps the most unusual event which you have thus far observed-and in which you have participated-is the spirit rally which has just ended. Tonight's dance honors Union's football team and the spirit that you noted is typical of the splendid support which the student body has given its team. Inci- dentally, the two most popular cheers are the sing-song and the locomotive-and they are easily leamed before 2 tomorrow. You may find your escort full of activity. Don't blame him for that-he has only two chances a year to show off his colleg-e, and lilterfmtemity Week-end has col'ne early enough this year so that many of the natural beauties of the campus may still be observed and enjoyed. The spirit of good fellowship that you see at tonight's dance will be even more fully emphasized on Satmday at houseparties. If your escort shows signs of staying at his own party all nig-ht and you want to get an even fuller picture of the college, talk him into using some of his bids and into going to parties at other houses. Just to reciprocate, let him talk you into seeing the college gar- dens, if they are open, during houseparties- even if you saw them Ball night. Sunday's lunch cannot be any but a happy meal even if you must leave directly after it. You'll be too tired to care about anything more than your feeling of happiness. Right now, as you return to Sonny Dun- ham's music, Union wants you to know that it is great having- you all with us-and that you all look beautiful. ------ ---------------- HAVE A GOOD TIME!! Dean 1·s Administrative Head Of A(ademi( Side of College <By WOBERT HAYNEU ~ \All the busine:ss having to do 1 with the academic ~ide of tlite college is done by us,\ Dean Ct:al'lcs F'. F. G~.Cris told the Con- eel diensis reporter who wa~ seek- ing infon~;atiun on thl' workings of !:is office. T·he dean had g1eeted hin1 with a fl·iendly sn1ite a:; he had cr!tered the office, a not alto- gether unfamiliar expel'ience fo1· students who have occasion to call al the sanctll'm sanctorum of the fh st floot· of the Administration Building. The Managing Editor had or- ~\ered him \to get a line\ on ju::;t what went on in the office of tlite Dean of Students and to find out ii it were reaHy thC' ·beehive of activitv suspected by undergradl!l- ates. So it seemed, for the effi- cient sta:ff of secret.uies wet e set- ting up a mild din on numero1:1s typew1 iters outside. a:nd the sounds ~ould' be heat d in the plain pleasant roo.m where Dean Gm·;s ra·T·, · on. Evidently a good deal of busi- nes:s of one sot t or another was ~oing on all the time het·P. Office Work \Just as all the financial side is ~anied on across thr hall by Mr. Hoadley, all the toutine of schedule- making, scholarship repm·ts, eligi- bility, permanent records, student employment and roughly five thousand othe1· things a:re canied out under our direction,\ hP con- tinued. Most of Union's undergraduates a:re familiar with such things as eligibility but how about schedules? The absence of conflicts and its whole smooth-running structme is a som·ce of a good deal of amaze- ment to people who have done any schedule making at all. \When I came here, there was no such thing as the schedule of classes we havp now,\ Dean Gari~ answered. \It was a hit or miss affak which was vet·y unsuccessful a,nd I was the first to undertake the making of a new one, prin- cipally because no one else wanted tn try it. I didn't hit upon the prPsrnt >ystPm right a\vay, though Like so many ether thing~. it has mon or less rvcl\'Pd O\\Pr a pet iod Dt-an Spnior Prof Pssor SomebC'dy had mentioned recent- ly that Professor John March was \\t ttH' st-niur prufes:;or of tlile Union College faculty_ The I' e- • Dt ter asked the dPan. \That's t·ight... the dean shot bllek. \that title is mine. True, Johnny has been here longet· than I have, but he was nut made a ft:ll pt·ofp-~ol unul aftel I was.\ DPan Garis came here in the fall of 1903, a graduate of Lafay- ette and while first here he took oraduate work at the University ')f Chicago. In 1906 he was made As'>istant Professor, and in 1908. teceived the appointment as Pro- frssor of Mathematics. In 1919 thP position of Dean of Students fell to him. \There used to be three deans then,\ he explained, \the Dean of the Faculty, Dean of Engineering \nd De'lP of Students. I held that position until 1933 when the pPsi- tion of Dean of the College was ~~ e >ted. I've held that post ever since.\ A g1 eat many changes must have come about in 39 years. No col- lre;e in this country is yet old enough to become so thoroughly ir.stitutionalized as have the Uni- versity of Oxford the reporter mid \The many changes which have come about here seem to indicate that the college's course is formed a great deal by the men who come rere.\ the dean pointed out. \In Europe, a new man on a college faculty is fitted into the system, and there is very little ot· no chance for the college to change to fit him. The latest change of course, is the creation of the new Educational Committee of the faculty.\ A November Special from the Golden Pages of Melody by Raymond Paige's Young Americans • Donkey Serenade • Stardust and othe~s on Victor Records at Cluett & Sons 508 STATE ST.

Several newly developed \plow trains,\ working from opposite ends of the line, are burying the cable for maximum protection. They dig deep furrows, lay two cables in them and cover them with earth-all in one continuous operation. Their meeting will mark com- pletion of the first all cable line across the continent. Carrier systems will be operated in the cables - one direction of transmission in each. This vast project is just one of thousands in which the Bell System is now engaged to provide additional communication facilities so vital to Army, Navy and defense industries. e G e 0 e e e e • e e e • e • A hou 10 j Mr .

On paper Union hasN't much of. n chance a~ainst once-beaten Ro- chester. The Garnet has been th1 a shed in five of its six games· and hasn't shown anything resem- bling an 0ffense except when it scored its 1on~> ttmchdown of the: season to ·beat Vermont, 7-6, three w.eelts ago. Rochester has scored 81 points in five games, while holding its op- ponents to 20 points. Union's six fops have 1 un up a total of 90 points to seven for Union.

The 'Jackets, who scored on the third play of the game, completed 12 of 21 passes. The ron test closely paralleled this year's RP.I. game. Union just couldn't get going, though it threatened three times. Fumbles ruined the Garnet's chances. With Rochester banking on pass- inll' as one of its chief offensive weapons and Union 1 elying almost exclusively on this type of attack, the game should be a wide-open affair. If last week's Williams game, which was played in a pouring rain is any indication, the wet grounds will not cut down the volume of either team's aerial attack. Ed Enstice will probably do the toss- ing for Union with Bill Bruckel ex- pected to lob them for the visitors. It may turn into a regular pitch- ers' duel. Union's tosses will have to be better than last week, how- ever, if the Garnet expects to be effective. A wet ball hampered the Union chuckers somewhat against Wiliams. F01 10 Union seniors tomorrow's game will be the last appearance on the Alexander field gridiron. These include Bob pavis, Gordie Semerad, Bob }iallenbeck, Bundy Shaw, Myron Mills, Stew Goldblatt, j Captain Bob Baker, Ed <Stice) En-, stice, Bob Killian and Lee Sher- man. Two other seniors who rated as regulars at the season's start, and who would have been closing their home careers tomorrow a1 e Sherry Billick and Abe Dorsman. Both have left the team. Rochester arrived on the campus ' Kappa Nu Wins Football Title Kappa Nu hauled the motheaten Statue of Liberty play out of the closet to beat Chi Psi, 6-0, fo1· the intramm a! touch football cham- pionship Tuesday. Bob (Pewee) Panoff was the hero, sprinting 50 yards to score behind beautiful blocking by Sy Meisel and two other dependables.

Many of us think that n.o~t. if not all, of this i~ just propaganda. Some of us are get- ting disgusted about it. Mo8t of us, however, are inter- ested in, and anxious to know, what is 1 eaJoly happening in the European and Chinese colleges. We are very sorry that we cannot tell you anything about college life in conquered European nations, but here are some statistics concerning the daily living of a college student in China: Cigarettes sell at one pack of 10 fur $1.40 Chinese money. Chin.-se PricPs These are the cheapest brand ever made. They sold in Hong Kong three years ago at one pack of ten for five cents, while the popular American biands sold for fifty cents for a pack of twenty. Pencils sell at one for $1.80 Chi- nese money. These are of the same quality as we can buy a dozen for 25c at a dime s~ore. They have no electricity, and kerosene is five gallons for $85. While a full professorship lle- ceives $300 a month and grammar and high school teachers get frcm $60 to $120, 1 ice per 100 pounds sells for $75. !The abov.e info1·mation is from the recent letter Yuen received from his cousin who is teaching in a university in Free China.> American Prices Here we are at Union; we pay 16 t'' 18 cents for a pack of cigarettes and a dime for a glass of beer. Get any idea of how much a pack of cigarettes and a glass of beer would mean to a college student in China? Twenty-eight cents will be a little mo1e than five dollars and sixty cents in Chinese money. This is quite a sum for a student the1:e, who has no means whatever to work for an income. Can you spare a couple packs of cigarettes and a couple glasses of beer for your fellow students who are unfortunate to be in such miserable circumstances? The World Student Service Fund is leading a drive to raise $100,000 among American college students. Half will go to European students in prison camp, and half will go to Chinese college students. We sincerely hope that all our college friends will do their part. Pleasant Valley Meat Market House of Sunshine Meat Products 586-592 Broadway PHONE 4-3181-2-3-4 For De Luxe Coaches CALL G. A.

The first in a new series of 15 minute programs, \The Intercol- legiate Newscast,\ will hav.e its initial presentation on the Union Broadcasting Sy-stem this Wednes- day evening at 7:30 p. m. Produced in the March of Time style, \The Intercollegiate Newscast\ is a di- gest of the important events on the campuses of all the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System Members. The new program was produced in the studios of the Columbia Uni- versity affiliate of the I. B. S. It was then recorded for use on other campus systems. Union will be the second campus to hear \The Intercollegiate Newscast.\ News for the program is gleaned fl om the campus publications ovtr 40 colleges. A script is then written in a combination of narrative and drama in a style typical of that used on the March of Time. After being recorded, transcriptions are immediately forwarded to the mem- ber radio systems. Since the na- tional defense program makes it impossible to obtain the exact records formally used for transcrip- tions, \The Intercollegiate News- cast is transcribed on a glass rec- ord. It is planned to make this a regular I. B. S. exchange series. ---01---- 0n to Clinton Tickets are still available for the Hamilton game at the gym office. There are plenty of rides available and inquiries to the Concordiensis will be referred to the l'ight parties. On Union Street Union students met with at least fcur accidents over the weekend. On Friday night an automobile driven by Brett Smither;;, '44, col- lided with another at Union and McClellan Streets. His car was a complete loss as was the other car. Smithers said that he dozed at the wheel and \hit head-on square- ly.\ He got out of the car to talk tu the other driver and collapsed because of his injuries. Taken to Ellis Hospital, Smithers was found to have cracked his teeth in the same place he did last year when he was hurt in a ski accident, in- jured his chest and also his knee. The other driver also suffered knee injuries. Saturday evening Eric T. King, '42, was slightly injured when the automobile he was driving ran into the rear of a parked car. Richard Raymond, '45, leading an Alpha Delta Phi parade back from the Riverwood, pulled off to the side of the road to fix his car after it had developed motor trouble. Another car pulled up to warn Ray- mond that \he had better get off the road,\ and King, coming around a cut·ve, ran into the second car which was parked partly on the· middle lane and outer lane of the road. \I couldn't see him until it was too late,\ he said. His date, who was riding next to him, was not injured. King received two black eyes and lacerations of the nose which required three stitches. pavid Van Dyck, '44, smashed into Raymond E. Aldrich's car as he rounded the corner in front of the Kappa Alpha house Saturday evening. Aldrich's car, parked in front of the house was considerably damaged. Van Dyck was not in- jured. Edward Hull, driving his Bantam, was struck by a hit and run driver who creased his fenders and re- moved the left view mirror. The driver of the car apparently did not see the Bantam. Hull reported the accident to the police who have, as yet, not caught the hit and run driver. --~01--~ Fees Due The third installment of TUI- TION is due and should be paid at the Comptroller's Office on Mon- day, Novembe1· 17.

These administrative proced- ures had been ::;omewhat hampered by the operation of a charter that dated to the eighteenth centm·y. ?\lost important body provided for in the FacultY Constitution is the Committee on Education. This body is expected to wield a majority of the power now held by the fac- ulty as a whole. In terms of administrative theory and practice, this delegation of power from a large to a smaller body is extremely wise. Now that this innovation on the )!)art of the faculty has centered attention on admin- istrative procedure at the colleg-e, it is of in- terest to exam.ine administrative procedure available to the Student Body. Key to student administrative procedure~ at Union is the Constitution of the Student Body, or what has been termed the Student Council Constitution. As with the new fac- ulty Committee on Education, power avail- able to the student::; is deleg-ated to the Stu- dent Council, a body that has a membership only one twentieth the number of the stu- dents as a whole. Like the Education Com- mittee, the Student Council is made up of both elected representatives and those who are members by virtue of positions that they holrl. In terms, the1·efore, of abstl·act adminis- trative o1·ganization, Union's Student Conn- oil and Constitution stack up as well as the Faculty Constitution and its Committee on Education, which were conceived by experts in the field of administration. The1·e i::; one further pmtion of the Student government setup that requires analy.sis, however-the opportunity, or lack of it, for flow of student sentiment to be directed through the Student Council to the nl'le-mak- i·ng· body of the college. Since we are fortun- ate in having an administmtion whose ear is alwars available to the student, there has been a great deal of opportunity !'or thi::; ::;tu- dent opinion to be hem·d. An example is the appointment last year of Professor ·wittner to the Committee on Admissions, after the Student Council had passed a resolution ad- vocating such action. The Student Council, however, like most policr-forming- bodies in the democratic pro- cess ,is too large to be formed of experts on any subject. As in the national Cong-ress, it is virtually impossible to have a majority of members who are, at any one time, experts on any single matter concerning the body represented. Further, the Student Council has only the general ear of the 1·ule-making body, rather than the specific ears of the specific rule- making bodies. This means that it is diffi- cult to make sentiments known to the spe- cific bodies concerned. It is unfortunate, as well, for the bodies which make the mles, since they must often be forced to work in the abstract on student problems, without the direct opportunit~· to hear sentiments of the students whose problems are being- treated. Some more direct form of student senti- ment repre:-;entaliun would, therefore, seem desirable in the current tl'end toward mod- emizing- and making more efficient adminis- trative procedures here. Other colleges, among them Lehigh, have made steps in that direction. It might be of benefit to Union to consider the problem of implementing it::; student rep- rPsentation on certain problems concerning the student body. HOW ABOUT ANOTHER Although the complete returns are not yet in, the recent Interfraternity Ball was evi- dently a financial success. \\'hat is more im- portant-it was undoubtedly a social success as anyone who attended the dance will attest. A great deal of c1·edit for the results must be given to :\Iessrs. \\'ikoff, Stiles, Leland and theil' cO-\\'OI'kers Wh<> spoi1sored the dance and attended to the many laborious details con- nected with such an affair. However, while not attempting to detract in any way from the job done by these men, it seems to us that a house party week-end is to our roman- tic undergraduates like tanks to Uncle Sam and cannot possibly fail with adequate organ- ization. If this is indeed the case an innocent by- stander would immediately ask why Union has only two such goings on per annum. Well, why do we? The spirit for mo1·e is certainly not lacking, and under om system of free enterprise supply should be made to equal demand. Speaking from a purely personal viewpoint it would seem better for all con- cemed if our restless students could work off their excess steam quickly rathet· than go on acting as decoys for a pair of Saratoga juke joints during the whole Schenectady rainy season. Inset·ting a third formal dance into the Union social schedule would necessarily re- quire a little reshuffling of dates . Here is one possible solution. Shift the date of fra- ternity initiations back to Februm·y-where a majority of those concemed would like it to be-and hold the proposed dance the eve- ning following- formal initiation rituals. This procedme has two recommendations. Firstly, it would give a title and reason fot· the func- tion, and, secondly, it would break up thP monotonous and dreaQ' stretch between Christmas and the spring recess. Very well, you may say, but who or what has the energy and ability to sponsor such an affair? The logical answer to this ques- tion is the much maligned Interfratemity Council which this ~·em· is beginning to bounce back off the canvas where it has lain in a subconscious condition since time was. Furthermore, the newly-formed neutral or- ganization-if it ever gets ove1· its labor pains-would probably be willing to lend a hand, especially with a modicum of encour- agement from the Greek lette1· boys in the form of a more liberal open-house policy. Perhaps the proposal outlined so briefly is not the correct diag-nosis of Union's social ailments. It assuredly is not put forth as a cure-all. But, iH repetition, Union could carry another big affair without risking condemna- tion as a \country club\ or interfering· in the least with the academic side of our college life. Those of us who have been here for two years or more will agree that the undergrad- uate's attitude toward his studies has im- proved tremendously. Why not a similar im- provement on the social side of college life? Roy H. Webster, '42 SCENE Con graduations Our heartiest congratt:1lations go t•J the entire Inter-fraternity Com- mittee and to Chait'man Fred Wi-· ltoff for the bang up job they did on this dance.

Sform of Color The Storm of Color was an ef- fective decoration and proved the: oft-made statement that elaborate hangings are not necessary to make either a good or a successful dance.\ The whirling flashes of red, green, vellow and other colors might have made some sick but for others they scr vcd as a wa·rning signal· that it was time to stop. As a decoration it was nothing new. Files of The Concordiensis tC'll us that during the 1925 Junior Prom the same effect was produced with several crystal balls hung from the ceiling of the gym on which several spotlights played. Glamour Plus If any girl was the standout of the ball it was Ray Aldrich's date, Teddy Kahill of New York. A pro- fessional model with a sure knowledge of clothing, she wore a floating white dress, a white tur- ban decorated with jewelry and ex- otic make-up and earrings. So striking was she that many dates asked to be taken to the Ka.p House to catch a glimpse of what she might be wearing Saturday night.

Though you wHI be al1:1mni of Union a good many years longer than you wiH be undergraduates, I assume, hom the lack of response, that you do not now give much thought to your r·elati0n t0 the College after graduation. I must, therefore, guess what will interest Concordy readers most in this matter of being an alumnus.

Not College football carries many different re- wal·ds. To some student bodies, the reward has been an undefeated season; to others ovel'- whelming victories over certain traditional rivals. Still other undergraduates may point to a player who is \going to be All-Amer- ican.\ The Union student body, on the day be- fore the final game of the 1941 season, has none of these rewards from its football. We have had no season in which we have won more games than we lost, nor have we over- whelmed any traditional rivals, nor do any of our players seem to be in a position to be selected for All-American mention. But half of Union's undergraduates will be many returned in those days, and in the stands at Clinton tomorrow to cheer the larger part appeared for their f!·aternity reunions.

THE MANAGERS' COUNCIIl Perhaps this rec0llection of mine i~ the best guide to your interest; su here is a brief summary of what alumni have been doing for you. It would take a lot of study of t1 easurers' reports and minutes 0f trustees and faculty to make any- thing like a complete picture of the aid the alumni organization has brought to the College since that Commencement in 1825 when it was formed. I do, however, know s0mething about alumni help in my own generation, from the founding of the Graduate Council in 1910. The Interfraternity Council this year is a body unlike the Interfraternity Councils we have seen in the past. This diffe1·ence is not explained by the fact that the 1941 body has just completed sponsorship of a successful Interfratemity Ball; there have been Councils in the past which have sponsored such affairs success- fully. This year's Interfraternity Council is dif- fet·ent because it recognizes that its purpose is a far larger one than the sponsorship of a social function; it is different because it recognizes that there are many problems on the Union campus that may be handled only by a strong and effective interfraternal organization that operates on a full year basis. The meeting of the Interfraternity Coun- cil that is scheduled for next Monday night will, we understand, begin the consideration of the new problems with which the group must contend-that of a constitution, that of continuity of membership, and that of problems with which the body may contend. In this latter category, it has been main- tained for some time that one of the chief problems with which the Interfraternity Council should concern itself this year is that of group buying. Since the Council will dis- cuss this problem Monday, The Concordiensis again presents the plan for a Manager's Council which was worked out by investiga- tors of this newspapel' after a consideration of prices paid for commodities by Union fra- ternities. (1.) That the Interfraternity Council establish as an organization subsidiary to it- self a council of house· managers and stew- ards to be known as the uManagers' Coun- cil.\ (2.) That this Managers' Council make it its business to see that every house man- ager is acquainted with the economy and purchasing techniques of every other house, and with the prices p·aid for commodities by th-e several houses, The Plan Asks (3.) That this Managers' Council inves- tigate further opportunities for economy among the various Schenectady sources of supply. (4.) That this Managers' Council con- sider itself responsible fo·r the further inves- tigaticm of the practicability of group buy- ing o:t Union. (5.) That this Ma.nagers' Council put into practice immediately any group buying methods, as soon as they ate found worth- while, no matter how far these methods may be fr·om the eventual gcal which is group buying in every practical way. First of all, there is the Alumni Gymnasium. You can look at Alexander Field and remember that alumni pressure and alumni help led the College last year to make that long overdue improve- ment. You can look farther north and see the Council Field, which i; the result of alumni insistance on more playing fields, backed by $10,000; and the bleachers too were paid for by alumni gifts. Alumni, working through the Council, pro- vided our present lighting system, the Chapel chimes, the north and east gates; (and just before the Council was founded, they had built the Payn.e Gate). There are the greenhouse, many improve- ments in the garden and campus planting, books for the library, cases for the geology exhibit room, and additions to classroom and laboratory equipment for which there was at the time no funds in the College budget. Touching the undergiaduates GARNET PICTURE CHARGES UNJUSTIFIED more closely are scholarships and loan funds. From eight to fifteen boys have been given scholarships each year from this source. All U,rough the depression years alumni gave the extra money to meet the extra demands on student loan funds; and even in the past six years. the total from the Alumni Gift Fund used for Student Loans has been $1~ ,529.00. The next time vou walk about the campus, per- haps you will give a little thought to the benefits you now enjoy .be- cause, thwugh the years, alumni have been working to make Union a better place for you. The Student Tax at Union is designed to cover expenses of those student activities whose costs are borne by the students them- selves. It is reasonable to expect, however, that there will occasionally arise unusual times in which a temporary additional charge may be levied upon certain students. There would and could be no intention on the part of anyone concerned in these \un- usual instances\ to make such instances of additional charges more than temporary. In this light, it is possible to justify the charge of one dollar levied by The Garnet on senior\ for pictures to be carried in the pub- lication. Those concerned with the question of the pictures have stated that there was no photographer available who would take the sittings without the charge of one dollar. The Expectation When the charges were made in the earlier part of the fall when the pictures were taken, therefore, that the money would be taken by The Garnet's photographer as a guarantee against loss from those students who pur- chased no individual pictures. The contract, as we understood it, bore out this proposition by stating that \one dollar will be charged all seniors for their pictures, the charge to be applied to their individual pictures in the case of those who buy individual pictures o1· ---a-- of FRE.\lHMAN WEEKLY DINNERS to be used as a sitting fee in the case st d t h ld' F h w k u en ·s o mg · res man ee \ those who do not.\ ly Dinner tickets for Sunday Eve- This wa£ not an ideal situation, but it ning should use their tickets for the week of November 23d on Sunday seemed that the unusual circumstances of evening, November 16th, as the din- this year would certainly not be repeated ing hall will not be open on the evening of the 23d. next, and that the matter might be viewed in that sense. But What Happened It became evident yesterday and the day before, when individual orders were being taken, that the one dollar fee does not apply to all individual picture orders. Only those orders that are approximately five dollars or more may have the one dollar applied to them. This situation has not the somewhat ra- tionalized justification applied to the original proposition; it is completely unjustified. No student activity on the Union campus has the right to become the vehicle for direct sales- manship, as this year's Garnet has permitted itself to become. The Garnet and its photo- grapher have al>solutely no right to withhold the dollar previously levied from being ap- plied to individual picture orders of any size whatever. We hope that those concerned with this matter will adjust it to the satisfaction of the senior class.

For the weekend at lea:.Et, life with tw0 other fathers is being paraded at our two first run pitchur palaces. Father N·o. 1 is Charles Laughton and the movie is \It Started With Eve\ and the theatre is Proctor's. '!'he star of this ene is supposed to be Deanna Durbin but don't let that throw you, as Mr. L. has the picture aU sewed up neatly in his inside pocket.

Mr. March gives ·an unusually fine performance as the kind, human, and somewhat theatrical pastor, and Martha Scott as his understand:ing wife gives another one of her per- fect screen portrayals. Yes indeed, Father now takes his place along side of Mother, the Spinster Aunt, and the Rich Unc'le as a definite dramatic character.

Scenting an Upset Union and Hamilton meet for the 49th time in 51 years tomor- row at Clinton, cine of the larg- rst, ·if not the largest, Union cheering section in history will .be on hand to urge the Dutchmen to a victory over their time-honOFed rivals, who are the big favorites to hand l:Jn·ion its seventh defeat in eight games. With only 13 p0ints to its credit in seven games, Union doesn't rate much of a chance to stop Hamilton unless it can hold Milt Jannone and his Continental mates to a meager one, or at the most two touchdowns. It isn't conceivable tl:at Union, on the basis of past performances, could do any better than this in a scoring way. Thus Union's chief hope lies in holding the HamHton scme below average while going out after two or three touchdowns for itself. Ten seniors will close their foot- ball careers for Union. Seven of them, Bob Davis, Stew Goldblatt, Gordie Semerad, Captain Bob Baker, Ed Eustice, Bob Killian and Lee Sherman will start. Coach Art Lawrence has an- nounced that he will start the same lineup which played the Roches- ter game last Saturday. There will be one exception. Ken Sharpe will be shiftEd from reserve center to starting quarterback, a post he held early in the seas0n. Davis and Cliff Platt will be the ends. Semerad and Bill Hill will start at the tackle posts and Bruno Schulze and Goldblatt will be the guards. Rejuvenated Bob Baker will go to center. In the starting Baker, Ed Enstice, Bob Killian, Sharpe and Enstice. Hamilton, which is seeking its fifth win in seven games, will bank on its scoring ace, Milt Jan- none, to beat Union almost single- handed, duplicating last year's 13-0 victory over the Garnet here. Union holds a 20-18 edge over Hamilton in the series with 10 tie games down in the records. Union ·beat Hamilton at Clinton in 1939 for the first time since 1926. Then it was by a mere 6-0 margin. The oft-cursed jinx of Steuben field nearly wrecked the hopes of I the 1939 team for an unbeaten sea- son. Ha!Jlilton, which hadn't won a game, nearly scored in the clos- ing minutes after shackling Union b a single touchdown. This jinx has limited Union to only seven victories in 24 games at Clinton. Hamilton, on the other hand, has been similarly futile at Schenectady, winning only six of 24 games.

But any passerby who got the impression that they had joined the rock- ing-chair brigade would be very much mistaken. They were conducting a scien- tific experiment to determine what color lights attract, and what repel, night-flying insects. U NLIKE the famous fell0w who wanted a left-hand monkey wrench, the young man at the window is perfectly in the right if the buckets he wants are the buckets for a steam turbine. For a double- flow turbine for ship propulsion has both right- and left-hand buckets. There's an important reason for using this construction. Though it sounds more complicated, a double-flow turbine oper- ates at higher speed, weighs less, and occupies less space than a single-flow one. All these are distinct advantages when the equipment has to be installed in a ship, where space is at a premium, And in times like these, when turbines must be turned out in a hurry, the smaller metal parts required represent an advan- tage in manufacture, too. General Electric, which has probably built as many naval and marine turbines as any other single manufacturer, is right now making more of them than at any time in its history, And by taking ad van- Results: mosquitoes and most other night- flying insects don't like red lights, prefer blue.

Other speakers decried the fact that students who have overcut have been \put on the spot\ when letters have arrived home overexcit- ing parents. Phone calls and spe- cial delivery letters have resulted while the student has had no warn- ing that a letter was going home. Joseph Furlong's motion that the \executive committee of t·he Coun- cil be empowered to meet with the dean, discuss the situation and make recommendations\ was car- ried unanimously. The Council also voted to allow the Garnet Key to hold a junior class beer party. A petition by the International Relations Club for representation on the Student Council and recogni- tion as a student activity was tabled until next meeting when the Club will have a representative there to explain its functions. Further details of the Council meeting will be found in other stories. Fmt<'rnities ·Inspecte-d Two years a:go a ·colleg.e commH- tee composed of Mr. Wyatt, Dr. C!owe and Assistant Comptroller Macrtwaine inspected both campus and off campus fraternities to check DB living conaitions. Mr. Mac- Dwaine made a detailed study of the fire -protection problem. Besides the college committee, city fire in- spectors regularly check up on the fraternities, Wyatt .said. At the time the committee made their inspection they found that only three quarters of the houses had an adequate number of fire ex- tinguishers. They made recommen- dations and today every fraternity is adequately equipped with extin- guishers. Faulty Wiring Disclosed Mr. Macilwaine checked electric wiring and the loads that the wires must carry, heating systems, evacu- ation of gasses and flues. In one case they found that a house had allowed exposed wiring to run behind the radiators in the living room. In another that the house had defective flues. Recom- mendations by the committee were accepted in both cases and the con- ditions no longer exist. The importance of a clean flue was demonstrated by the recent Outing Club fire at \Skihaben\. The only cause of the fire was said to have been a stuffed chimney. Only the off campus fl·aternities lack fire escapes. Two of the cam- pus fraternity houses, Chi Psi and Psi Upsilon bave inside fire escapes while all the others have outside escape facilities. Both also have fire walls and fire doors. The dif- ference between the houses lies in the fact that the off campus frater- nity houses were built as private homes, ii!Ir. Wyatt said. WATCH AND JEWELRY REPAIRING- ENGRAVING JAY JEWELRY co.

Kappa Nu and Delta Phi defeated Kappa Alpha and Phi Sigma Kap.pa respectively by a 2-1 vote of the judges in each case. Sigma Chi won by a forfeit from Phi Sigma Delta. Next Tuesday evening at 7:30 in Silliman Hall, Delta Phi will meet S.gma Chi in the semi-final playoff round, the winner meeting Kappa Nu for the title. Kappa Nu re- ceived a bye into the finals by vittue of a better pel'fetmance than Delta Phi in last night's competi- tion. The judges for the playoffs Hre Dr. Bronner, Dr. Sylvester and 1\-Ir. Rotundo. Labor Is ,.Topic \Does lhe National Emergency 1 equire further regulation of la- bor?\ was the subject of the de- bates. The sub-topics dealt with the efficiency of existing machinery to settle labor problems and the ca- pacity to cope with those problems, as well as the question of the necessity for further machinery and it~ nature. There was general agreement in the Kappa Alpha-Kappa Nu debate that the government was unpre- pared to deal with the labor problem with existing machinery. It could be solved, it was maintained, either by compulsion or on a voluntary basis. There was agreement on both side~ that difficulties have bEen caused by both labor and business. The loss of disagreement, that is an anti-strike act or a measure enacted against industry, \auld be serious. The right to strike should be curtailed, but labor's rights should not be abol- ibhed. Kappa Alpha was represent- ed by Raymond Aldrich, '42, and Kenneth Payne, '45, while Kappa Nu was represented by Armand Feigenbaum, '42, and Mattin Cap- lan, '44. Machinery Inadequate The fundamental issue is not one of strikes, the Delta Phi main- tained, but rather one of solving disputes between labor and indus- try. Strikes are merely a tool, they asserted. Both Delta Phi and Phi Sigma Kappa agreed that the .ex- Isting government machine1·y can- not adequately cope with the problem. It was finally decided that if the United States adopted a war- time economy, the government should conscript both labor and in- dustry.

LeRoy's Understanding LeRoy, questioned by a Concordi- ensis reporter concerning the com- plaints which have been raised over the sitting fee, explained that as he understood the contract, the photo- grapher is to apply the sitting fee toward any pictures bought by the seniors for personal use. \Evident- ly\ LeRoy added, \the photograph- ers are interpreting that to mean that a total of five dollars worth of pictures must be purchased be- fore the sitting fee is refundable. \I feel confident, however\ Le- Roy said, \that the whole situation can be straightened out. I think that an agreement on this trouble can be made which will be found to be satisfactory by the Seniors\. Garnet staffmen have pointed out that a survey of other photographic agencies in this area has revealed that all insist on similar clauses in contracts for work like that re- quired by the Garnet. ---01---- 'Wings Over Jordan' Here November 24 Wings Over Jordan, sponsored by The George W. Carver Welfare League, will appear in the Union College Memorial Chapel on Mon- day evening November 24. Tickets a1 e on sale in the book- store. This represents one of the best musical attractions to come to Schenectady this year, according to Robert K.

Gould Claims Student Drivers Are Rec:kless Driving on the campus by defense class students is much safer and less confused than at the same time last year, Thomas Gould, campus policeman, reported today. Student driving. however, is worse than at any time in recent years, he added. Chief complaints against students seem to be for failure to observe campus traffic regulations both as to speed and parking, and a refusal to obey in- structions. Let's Go Slumming To our Friends at Union: The Sociology Club of Skidmore invites our Union pals to a Slum Dance, Saturday, November 29th, at the College Recreation Center on Spring Street. Music for danc- ing will be played from 8:15 to 12, so come, either stag or with your favorite gal. The admission is $.35 a couple or $.25 stag. And, in case you're hungry, refreshments will be served. Proceeds from this dance will go to charity. Again we say, get out your very oldest clothes and come slumming Sat- urday nite, the 29th of November! -Skidmore Sociology Club Of those appi·oached, 89~ con- tributed an average total of $1.91, which is three times more than the average amount contributed la·st year. Returns from four fra- temities, one section of North College and from >lix neutral com- muter groups have yet to be counted. Everyone of the 82 neutrals liv- ing in Oldgym Hall, South and North Sections of South College, South and Middle Sections of North College contributed to the Campus Chest. They gave an average of $1.98. Ninety per cent of the 356 frater- nity men who pledged money, pledged more than $2.08. Non- contributors among the fraternity groups approached ·brought the fraternity average down to $1.93 a man. Seventy-three pet· cent of the non-fraternity commuters pledged money compared with only 5% last year. Sixty-three of the 87 con- t<.Lcted gave more than the $1.29 av- erage of the commuters. Individual fraternity house av- erages ranged from $1.10 a man to $4.20 a man. Six houses were nbove the Campus Chest goal of $2.00 a man. Because of Campus Chest rules, the individual amounts cannot be published, but dorm contributions varied from $1.10 to $3 50 while the commuter contribu- tions ran from $.80 to $1.66. Of the senior class who returned t!oe!r pledge cards: 15 gave less than $1, 32 gave $1, 2 gave $1.50, 3::; gave $2.00 and 11 gave more than $2. Of the juniors w.ho have returned their pledge cards: 7 gave less than $1, 27 gave $1, 3 gave $1.50, 43 gave $2.00 and 14 gave more than $2.00. ' Of the sophomore men who re- ported: 9 gave less than $1, 39 gave $1, 6 gave $1.50, 4 gave $2.00 and 17 more than $2.00, Of the freshmen who retm·ned their pledge cards: 7 gave less than $1, 27 gave $1, 3 gave $1.50, 43 gave $2.00 and 14 gave more than $200. The complete returns as well as the amount to be given to each charity which is represented on the campus by the Campus Chest will be announced next week. Bishop reported that he and his committee were highly gratified by the return. He also said that the drive was not ended, as an exten- sive effort would be made to reach those who have not yet been con- tacted by chest workers. ---·0--- College Water Pipe Ablaze; Administration Says 'Rats!' No damage was done by a small blaze in the basement of the Ad- ministration Building at Union Col- lege late yesterday. Pungent smoke, however, filled both the Adminis- tration Building and neighboring Silliman Hall. The first started when Warren Guernsey, a mem,j:ler of the college grounds crew, crawled into the ex- tension of a temporary water pipE: between the two buildings, lighting his way with a match. A large mass of paper said by college authorities to have been deposited in the pipe by rats caught fire. From the pa- per the fire spread to the outer covering of the pipes. Smoke from the blaze was brought into the two buildings through .the pipe conduct. The ground crew quickly extinguished the blaze. Guernsey was uninjured. ---o---- UBS on Air Tonight .

Many unfortunates throughout the nation and the world would thank you, if they could. forts to raise the rest of the cam- pus were in vain. The Game Union made a fine showing with about 300 of the 450 students ex- pected at Clinton the.re. That was a larger Union crowd than had ever before traveled to Hamilton. We do so wish that the cheer leaders would get a new set of cheers. That Hamilton trumpet call was really good and might well be copied by Union. So ought that Nott Terrace che€'r which might be changed to \When :you're up, you're up, when you're down, you're down; and when you're up against U n i o n you're upside down.\ But it was refreshing to see all the cheer leaders there.

FRATERNITY 'RULES' that they led more cheers Satur- comment. which we believe is true. day than they did at the Hamilton- Union game last year at Mont Relations between Union's administration and Union's social groups have always been very healthy. A good measure of this health is based on the fact that the college's fraternities have had placed upon them a maximum of respon- sibility and a minimum of control. There has been only one control device for frater- nity dances, beer parties and the like. That has been the app1·oval of the Dean. As vdth all good things, there has been abuse of this arrangement. Fraternities have, on occasions, failed to obtain permis- sion for functions; the1·e has been a measure of neglect for the \no liquor rule\; and even formal initiations have been held which have not cle<U'ed through the Dean's office. These abuses are bound to arise in the loose check that Union's administration and Union's students agree is, i.>y far, the best arrangement. They are not expected to con- tinue long. Union's fraternities have to recognize that they are just as much parties to the bargain as is the administration, and they should conduct themselves accordingly. A WINTER DANCE General student approval seems accorded the suggestion that has recently been made for a college social function during the slack winter season. That the Interfraternity Council should sponsor this affair seems ap- propriate. a function that would possess sufficient at- traction for men to invite their \best girl\ even though that gid lived at a distance. Other Suggestions Pleasant. After the Game Most o.f Union went home right after the game. A few hung around fraternity houses there vainly seeking to hold forth. Jack Pearson and Joe Jaycox tried to stop the Hamilton bell ringing but weren't successful at all. First they wandered up to the bell tower in the chapel and helped to ring the bell while they tried to think of ways to end the· noise Eventually they went down to the cellar and pulled out the main switch. Then they cut over to the Chi Psi house for a knife, but by the time they were back in the chapel, the lights were on, and the Hamilton beil ringers were sus- pic·wus. Jack, put out the chapel, played \drunk\ and pretended he was asleep in. one of the window nitches along the stairs. Finally the whole episode ended when little Roy Julie, the Hamilton cen- ter and Sig, rescued him just be- fore the rest of the bell crew were going to tie a rape around the \drunk\ and throw poor Jack out of the window. . \ '··.· '.• .. ·. soci!11tion) in article on Arthur in the Dictionat•y of American Biography. \The presidential administration of Arthur was dignified, honorable and as in- teHigently constructive as the even division of politics would permit.\ Arthm· M.

V·l67 When this dance could or should be held, what form it should take-these are open questions. It seems hardly possible that another houseparty week-end could be either ap- proved o1· arranged at this stage of the year. The winter carnival idea that has cropped up time after time must be discarded again for the same reason as always-there are no facilities. Some quarters feel that a formal dance on a Saturday night, without an accompanying week-end, would be too expensive to justify its beiHg. Suggestions have been made for some form of outdoor sports event to be held before or after a Saturday afternoon hockey game that might be scheduled by the college. This, too, would lead to complications. Afterward he and Jaycox went over to a dorm and pulled out 32 fuses to plunge the place into dark- ness. Here, unable to restore the power, the Hamiltonians living there, extended an invitation to at- tend a dorm cocktail par.ty. All was harmonious Jack reports. i. r No Cramming Necessary! A dance might conceivably be sponsored after a basketball game, but this would en- tail the problem of dancing in a gym that is none too large as is, and would have even less space due to the addition of bleachers. A simple informal dance might not accomplish the purpose of the affair-that uf furnishing The fact remains that Union needs one fairly large, or more than one small all-col- lege social function during the winter. Past events have shown that these dances are ex- cellent opportunities both for individual en- tertainnlent and for uniting the college com- munity. When such a function should be held, and what form it should take is a question that is best answered by members of the student body. What do Union'~ students think?

Stew G0ldblatt and Gordie Sem- et·ad, Union gave a fine account of itself even to the poin·t of threatening to pull an upset a.t two points during the game. Miss FiPld Goal Had the Garnet been able to take advantage of the break it get on the opening kickoff, .the whole result might have ·been different. Returning Sherman's opening boot, Ralph Leavenworth fumbled 0n the Hamilton 20. Baket· recovered. Two bucks by Sherman took the ball to Hamilton's eight~yard line. Three plays later Sherman missed a fourth down try for a field goaL Sending Milt Jannone off to the promised land twice on jaunts of 40 and 56 yards around his own l'ight end, Hamilton had taken a 14-0 lead by half time. There didn't seem any stopping the four-roan wedge of interference which guided the Continental star on these romps, and as the teams left the field at the intermission, a rout seemed in prospect. Union surprised the capacity as- semblage by playing a different game in the third quarter. Defen- sive alertness was the key to this improvement. Hamilton didn't get past mid-field once in the stanza. Then the unexpected happened. T.:nion scored. Doug Slingerland, given an opportunity to play a lot ot tackle for the first time in s~veral games, recovered a Hamil- ton fumble on the Buff and Blue 10-yard line. Then Union suddenly decided to pass. Enstice tossed Is your car ready for cooler weather? Are you going to fol- low the team? Get your car in shape at BEEKMAN'S 601 UNION ST.

If Union had been able to con- tinue to stop Hamilton from here. on, the chances are that it might have come very, very close to a victory. Hamilton Scores Union wasn-t quite equal to the situation, though, and Hamilton turned the contest into a rout with three touchdowns in the first five minutes of the final .period. Leaven- worth streaked 40 yards to score after flying through his own right tackle almost faster than the eye could perceive. Hamilton set up another score the very next time it got the ball. Vinnie Hockmyer made a 50-yard 1 unback of one of D0n Quigley's punts before he was finally nailed on the Union five. Two cracks at the line by Leaven- worth produced the score. Once again Hamilton kicked off and once again it scored as soon as it got the ball again. This time Phil Dodd passed 15 yards to \Buzz\ Eberle on the Union 15-yard line and Eberle ran over for the score. With Hamilton leading, 34-6, Union's stands were pretty quiet. 'l'hey had nothing more to cheer for and their team was doomed to go down to its seventh defeat, the worst record of a Union team since 1928. Pa.sses Click Yet Eddie Enstice wasn't giVmg up. He suddenly foun.d the passing range he had been seeking all afternoon, and Union was off to the races. The Dutchmen drove 75 yards to a score with Enstice In complete possession of the controls. He started off with a 13-yard trip around his right end. Then he connected on his next four out of five passes, three to pavis and one to Cliff Platt, and Union was on the Hamilton 10 with a minute and a half to play. Enstice then tossed his best pass at the afternoon. Platt took it un- 1 molested in the end zone, and then Enstice passed to ;Don Quigley for the extra point, after fumbling · an attempt to placekick. Anything you need?

Semera·d Holds First Scrimmage With Varsity Basketball Team Basketball scrimmage started 8:•----------- yesterday and Coach Ralph Seme- rad found it rather hatd to make a definite conment on the abilities of the crop 0f hopefuls or on the chances of the coming season. He sta-ted that, as a whole, the fellows are not lacking in height, but in weight, which is quite un- Ufual in basketball. The veterans, Captain Benny Jakobowski and Whitey Cam- wright, are bearing up nicely in practice thus far. Johnny Clowe, a member of last year's freshman team, has also shown up well to date. Strong on defense and follow-ups ia Ronnie Macomber; Shorty Peer, although doubtful now, should be a starter OJ' an alternate starter by the beginning of the season, Ed Allen and Bob Smolka are working together as guards but are rather spotty on the offensive. Ted Vinick, also from last year's varsity, has a good eye and plays a strong of- fensive game, but needs improve-! ment on his defensive work. . These were the comments of the new coach. * * Greatest disappointment to the tf'am thus far is the handicap of \VatTcn Harvey, on whom Semerad r,as banked much, for his eyes do not focus quickly or correctly.

It was stuff which should have been bt ought out lon.g, long ag0, but 1 set·iously question the judgment of the author in the manner in which he chose to present it, the time he picked to do it, and the bia::; with which he clouds the facts. 8onwont' should -lw shot for tht• unfounded crack about \phony spit•it.\ That hurt. It was al- · most an admission by Pat that hP himst>lf was llhony in thl-' hat•d worli he did to gPt the college bl'hind its football tt•am this fall. It was an tmjustified blow be- low the belt as the rnthusiasm and strength of the chPering section at Clinton proved the nrxt day.

Del'egates to the annu:xl Confer- ence of the ·Second Province of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity, embrac- ing five America:n schools and three in Canada will be the guests of the Union Chapter of the frater- nity here next weekend. The Con- ference, which begins Fl'iday after- noon, will continue throughout Sat- urday, and will include •both social and ·fraternity affairs, as the dele- gates exchange views on mutual problems in the three scheduled business sessions, and attend a for- mal dance at the chapter house Satur-day evening. 76 students now employed ·by this Student Work Progra:m would be directly affected by the possible ~l:Ction of the government agency. The first reduction in the payroll will not affect Union students now employed. However chances for others to obtain NY A employment are exceedingly slim as there will be no new assignment of jobs nor any replacements made. \Any stu- dent releasing his job cannot now be replaced by another student,\ Miss Travis said. Debate Fin a l.ists To Meet T oni·ght Delta Phi vs. Kappa Nu In Last Match Scheduled For Intramural Campaign Delta Phi and Ka•ppa Nu will meet in the final match of the Phi'l- omathean Society Intramural De- bating Program for the college championship this evening at 7:30 p. m. in Silliman Hall. Washburn HalL Reticent at the The story of the Managers' Coun- outset of the meeting, the managers cil, which The Concordiensis had soon \loosened up\ and, when the long urged on the council, is car- meeting officially adjourned, the ried in another column. men gathered in groups, in which the exchange of pertinent informa- tion lasted for some time. This fa:ct in itself is one of the main goals to be accomplished by this newly-formed Managers' Coun- cil, ,called togeth'er this week ·by In- terfraternity Council President Fred Wikoff, '43. Wikoff opened the meeting Wednesday night, with the avowed purpose of \letting it go under its own steam,\ and that is just what happened. With Van Thompson, '43, as temporary chair- man, the councilmen soon were ex- changing bits of valuable and, quite often, highly interesting in- formation. Discussion Diversified Discussion ranged from talk of laundry prices to evidences of \short-weighting\ found in certain of the houses represented. This last development evo!{ed no little interest from other members of the council, until this time apparently oblivious to any possibility of indis- cretions along this line among food and meat dealers. Most obvi- ous remedy for this \evil\ has .been used by some of the fraternities. It is the simple expedient of purchas- ing a set of scales with which occa- sionally to check on dealers' weights. In addition, it was ex- .plained, the mere sight of the scales in the kitchens of fraternities does its part to discourage any more of this sort of thing. It is ·in this sort of informal dis- cussion that the new council ap- pears to be most interested. Co- operative buying, in the strictest sense, appears to be some distance off, as yet. If co-operative buying should come to Union, it will come as a result of the type of meeting held Wednesday. To Met>t Next Wt>t>k Action or a constructive nature was also taken when the council de- cide-d to re-convene next Wednesday evening at which time representa- tives will bring actual price lists on canned and baked goods which will be exchanged and compared. Wikoff also announced that the Ma·nagers' Council was now an offi- cial sub-committee of the Interfra- ternity Council. This announce- ment came as a result of the Inter- fraternity Council's action last Monday night. Fraternities represented at Wed- nesday's meeting were Chi Psi, Kappa Alpha, Delta Upsilon, Psi Up.Eilon, Kappa Nu, Sigma Phi. Phi Sigma Delta, Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Chi, Phi Delta Theta, and Delta Phi. ----0---- Date of 'Smoke Screen' Drive Set for Dec:. 8 Song Contest in Spring No date w!'.s set for the Interfra- ternity Sing which has in former year, been held in the spring. The council did not say whether the dorms would be allowed to com.pete in the sing as they have in former times nor have they made any of the rules for the sing .public as yet. Six new amendments to the Coun- cil's constitution were made. In the future each fraternity will have only one representative. No other brother will be allowed to represent the fraternity in the case that the regular Interfraternity member can not be at the meeting. Definition of Quorum A quorum is to consist of ~., of the members and \··• of the mem- bers ·present will be necessary to pass a measure. Furthermore no measure may be passed without be- ing referred to individual fratern- ities. Should a fraternity refw:e to abide by a measure .passed ·by the council, the measure is temporarily suspended until review. A unani- mous vote is necessary to suspend a chapter or readmit one. Council members, absent from two or more meetings will be eligible for suspen- sion. The office of secretary-treas- urer is broken up into two offices. ----0---- Cheek Reveals All Freshmen Are 'Marked' After a thorough check made at the beginning of chapel Wednesday morning, Chairman Andrew Reilly '42, of the Freshman Orientation Committee announced that his group had found but two freshmen without either hats or armbands. Both freshmen promised to get armbands at once. Mrs. Jenkins said yesterday that the bookstore has sold \about 40 armbands\ to freshmen. The conference, held each year at a different cha·pter in the Province, will be attended by D. U.'s .from Hamilton, Syracuse, Colgate, Roch- ester, Cornell, McGill, Toronto, and Western Reser·ve as well as Union . Two undergraduates from each col- lege are expected. Representing the host chapter and ·acting as president and secre- tary of the conference will be Em- len T. Hutchins, '42, and Robert H. Hayner, '43. ~~~o-~- Plans for Christmas Youth Meeting Scrapped An investigation of the possibil- ities for holding a conference of youth groups during a week-end of the Christmas recess was projected here this week. A questionnaire was distri'buted to dormitory residents asking them if they would .be willing to :xllow the representatives to use their rooms during the Christmas vaca- tion. Besides the ballot at the bot- tom, Dr. Fox pointed out the ad- vantages that woufd come to Union from such a conference. In return for the use of the rooms the col- lege would be willing to launder the bedding which the delegates would use, he wrote. Dor·mitory students did not feel, however, that they wanted their rooms used over the recess, and the information thus obtained was sent the organization in New York City which was planning the meeting. The group replied by thanking the college for its cooperation and r e- ported that the conference w.ill I probably be held at Harvard Uni- versity in view of the unavailability of housing facilities here. Pay Check Slash A slash in each NY A-employed student pay check may be expected after January 31, 1942, Miss Travis said. :She predicted a ·cut of at least 25'/f in the government appropria- tion. Such a cut, she said, would reduce Union's allotment of $855 monthly to $641.25. The· money saved will probably 'be used by the government for national defense. T.he Student Employment Bureau will make public a detailed schedule of the changes .brought about by the slash in the Union NY A appro- priation, Miss Travis said. This will be the second cut the college has had to take ·since the start of this year, At the beginning of the pres- ent academic year Union'·s allot- ment was cut from $1155 to $855 per month. Floodlight to Illuminate ALCO Parking Field .Sixteen floodlights are to ,be erected this weekend on the parking lot which the American Locomotive Company has made from the college pasture which they leased at .the start of the year. The lights will be directed on the automobiles parked thei'e and will muminate every corner of the field. Workmen told a Concordien- sis reporter yesterday that the lights were being built to \pre- vent monkeyshines on the lot by the college.\ The reporter pointed out that \r on the field were a thing of the past since the removal of the tractor. The workmen said that they had \heard different.\ On Wednesday evening Delta Phi defeated Sigma ·Chi in a semi-final contest to determine who would meet Kappa Nu in the finals. As yet Delta Phi is undefeated in competition. Kappa Nu has lost one debate, and that to Delta Phi. How- ever, Kappa Nu accumulated more points than Delta Phi and finished in first ·place in the same league. Partici,pating in the finals for Delta Phi will be Roy Webster, '42 and Frank Thyne, '42, while Kappa Nu will be represented ·by Armand Feigenbaum, '42 and Martin C:xplan, '44. The decision will be announced in assembly on Saturday morning at which time the trophy will be awarded to the winner. This evening a varsity debate will ·be held in Hale House with the St. Lawrence University .society on the subject of the adequacy of our de- fense effort. Representing Union will .be ChaTles Collesano, '44 and Clifford Tepper, '44. ~~~o·-~- Two Eminent Journalists Debate Britains Future Next Sunday's Town Meeting of the Air will bring together two of the best contemporary authorities on the world scene in a discussion ovei' the particularly pertinent sub- ject, \Can Britain Keep Her Em- pire?\ The discussion, part of which will, as usual be broadcast, will .be caT- ried on by Dr. Norman B. Angell, noted foreign journ:xlist, and Alex- ander B. Hadani, a native of Pales- tine, and an authority on economic affairs, .particularly in the Near East. Dr. Angell, who will uphold the affirmative answer to the topic question, is a native of England, although he spent most ·of his youth in the western part of the United States, ranching and prospecting. 208 Students, 39 Less Than Last Year, Achieve Dean's List Average; Seniors Lead All Other Classes with 61 Men, Juniors Lowest with 47 A total of 208 students, 39 les:;:<£•>---------------- --------------------------------- than last year, achieved an index of 3.00 or better during the .first marking period Dean Charles F.

St•J-UWH'l' Tlrit'kmnn UNION AND THE WAR EFFORT President Leonard Carmichael of Tufts College told a meeting of the American Asso- ciation of Colleges earlier this month that he could see no altemative to American colleges' accepting, in the nem· future, some form of the Wm·ld War I plan of \colleges as army camps.\ Agreeing with President Carmichael, who is connected both ·with agencies of the war effort in Washington and with a fine college, we1·e some of New England's leading educatot·s. Dr. Carmichael and his colleagues admitted that the World War I army camp system was fal' from successful in America's colleges and that another pl'Ogram directly similar to it would 'be highly unfortunate for all con- cemed. In their opinion, howeve1·, some im- proved system would be necessary for the continued existence of many of America's colleges as America's war effort becomes mot·e and more intense. Which Means? What does it mean to us when American educato1·s, who have studied the problem, foretell in this fashion another Student Army Training Corps, the reappearance of which was \condemned forever\ by other American educators at the end of the First '\\odd \\' m· '! It means that whethe1· we like it o1· not the students and faculties of American col- leg·es face again the threat to the existence of their institutions that total \Vai\ presented on a smaller scale during World War I. It means that if we do not want a recur- rence of the \colleges a·s army camps\ SA TC scheme that the total war th1·eat occasioned in 1918, and if we want to demonstrate that the lesson of that era has not gone unnoticed we must: 1. Analyze realistically the problems with which American col1eges will probably be faced by a continuation of America's war effort. 2. 01·ganize a means for solving these problems which is college conceived and de- veloped while the opportunity fot· measured thinking yet remains. 3. Put these solutions into effect before agencies of the nation, which are not as keen- ly attended to the collegiate scene nor as sympathetic with it as are college agencies, are forced to take their own steps. Form of the Analysis The analysis would first take the form of 1·ecognizing, soberly and realistically, that the United States is in a war in which both sides realize that defeat will mean complete dom- inaton for the winning \way of life.\ It would recognize that, as time goes on and the pres- sure to win the war becomes more and more intense in America, we, like Britain, will be forced to become more and more \practical\: those features of life which do not have as their immediate r-esults steps leading toward the winning of the wm· will be subordinated to those features that do. It would recognize that the results of this situation \Vould find American liberal arts colleges relegated to an \impractical at the present moment\ category, and those in the colleges having to take the results of such a classification. That this will occur may be predicted \vith at least a minimum of safety, in view of similar results throughout the world. College Privileges Will End The fact of the matter is that American liberal arts colleges would be in that \im- practical\ category right now, were it not for enlightened leaders. While these national leaders have thus far been sincerely and courageously able to force recognition of the great importance of the non-technical school to the broade1· purposes of our war effort, we may have little assurance that they will be able to follow this course in the future. As the nation's needs become more and more those of \war winning necessities\ and as the nation's leadership is composed more and rno1·e of those men who will be able to pro- duce those necessities, the liberal arts col- lege will be seen in the light of an institution in which potential resources are being used in pursuits which, while valuable fot· the fu- ture, \just have to\ be used at once. Colleges will be raided wholesale for the faculty brains they have and a far more ag- gressive policy will be adopted for drafting those students whose college training does not develop a man immediately useful to the nation. A finishing touch to the process might well be lowering the draft age-which the head of Selective Service has long advo- cated. Not 'Right' But 'Necessary' We do not mean to suggest that America's attitude toward her institutions of liberal learning has not become more enlightened since World War I, no1· that every attempt will be made to preserve colleges as they are. But, as the present world situation was forced upon us and forced us to change from a course that was leading to things far more important than destruction and bloodshed, even so would the commandeering of liberal college 1·esources be forced upon us. There would be two means whereby this \commandeering\ might yet permit retention of many of the values and forms of the American liberal college of today. Both would enable retention of most of the courses and some of the activities now available in the colleges. They would also add new serv- ices and courses-military training important among them-which would furnish more di- t•ect benefit to the nation's immediate needs than the regular courses and activities of the colleges. The Alternatives First system would be an SATC, under any title, conceived and developed on a national scale by an essentially non-college group. With the 1918 experience as a basis for an- alysis, it would be expected that this alterna- tive would see an attempt at subordinating regular college functions to the new func- tions, one reason for so believing being that the men who would administer the system would be those who had the \practical\ standpoint of the new functions-military and otherwise. Second system would be conceived by the colleges themselves, probably in conjunction with government agencies, and would be developed and put into practice by the col- leges. Since the group organizing this one of the two alternatives would be one under whose aegis the regular college functions had developed, it would seem that fairly full op- portunity would be afforded for the tradi- tional values of the liberal college to hold at least an adequate place in the new picture. Lack of space does not permit a further discussion of the remaining alternatives·. · They will be discussed in the next issue of The Concordiensis.

This most recent who- dunit tells an involved, static tale of the murder of two Runyonese characters. The whole thing ends up in Inspector Sam Levene's of- flee, with peerless PoweH pointing the guilty finger at the least likely murderer, wh0m you suspected all the time. The suppo1·ting cast is barely adequate, although Stella Adler does make us anxious to see more. 'Bedroom Eyes' Cases two, three, and four are Charles Boyer, Olivia DeHaviland, and Paulette Goddard, whose movie \Hold B?,ck the Dawn\ is currently playing at the State. Bedroom-Eyed Boyer has always been the epitome of the continental love maker, but his past escapades are nothing com- pared to what Charlie the charmer does in this job. In it, he plays the part of a European gigolo who is awaiting entrance ·into the United States from Mexico. This he does by marrying an American school teacher who turns out to be luvly Oluvia whose forte has always been the sweet and unsophisticated hero- ine. Palatable Paulette, one of the screen's most tasty dishes who bas always been unexcelled for just looking tempting, is not required to do much moTe as one of Boyer's ex- flames. The film is good, although it is hampered by wasting too much footage on unnecessary stuff such as a Mexican fiesta and a cops and robbers chase. The dawn was held back a bit too long.
