The Concordie11 sis VoL. XXIV. UNION Q:QLLEGID, MAY 2, 1'901. No. 26. BASEBALL SEASON OPENED. Rochester Defeated by a Score of 10--6. Union gained fiv:e runs before McPherson gave way to Captain Webster, in the middle of the eighth inning. Captain Parker, taking Mallery's place, kept the visitors from scoring in the ninth and the gatn;e ended with Union the winner. The good coacb:,ing received by Union's repre- sentatives on the diamond this spring from Dr. Towne, showed itself repeatedly on the fi.eld last Saturday, when the first game of the season was played with tlle Rochester University team. This game was a ra:ther itnportant one to begin the season with, as the result will help towards the securing of the Baseball Championship of : the N. Y. S. I. C. A .. A. again this year. For Rochester, Love,. McPherson, Lawton and Webster played the best ball. The Roch- ester men put up a good dean game and kept Union guessing until the encl. All of the wearers of the Garnet did their duty and it is hardly , possible to praise one tnan over another. Of ·course, the Witbeck-Griswold combine was in- vincible as ever. The score: Rochester can1e to Schenectady 1ast Saturday with a record of three games already played. She had held Cornell down to 9-6, and h[ld defeated Colgate 8-7, and Hatniltan 12-6. With this showing they had already made on the diamond, the Rochester men could hardly have been otherwise than confident of the result of the game here. Witbeck, Delaney and Terry were all up frotn the Law School. ·'Whit\ was in his usual good form, and it was due tnore to his mystifying twirling that the visitors were shut out fron1 scoring for the ~rst five innings. In the middle of the sixth inning, Witbeck was unfortunately take11 ill, and compelled to retire, after having struck out four men, and allowing the Rochester men to secure only a few scattered hits. Mallery was then put in the box and did good work for Union, though he was some- what inclined to be erratic. The visitors gained only one run until the eighth inning when the wearers of the Ga1·net made several fumbles and Rochester increased their score by five runs, leading Union at that point in the game by one run. McPherson pitched good ball for his college, though the players on the hotne team soon found his cut·ves and hit him quite freely. He, how- ever, shut out Union in the first, fourth, sixth and seventh innings, and struck out five men. ROCHESTER. A. :B. R. lB. S.H. P.O. A.

WITH the budding of the trees and the general rehabilitation of nature, everyone's thoughts and desires naturally lead him out of doors. It is about time that a series of campus meetings be commenced. Other colleges have them. In what way can enthusiasm be better generated than by listening to good, inspiring speeches and by sing- ing college songs? With three athletic meets this spring and a number of important baseball games in the future nothing is more needed to inspire the representatives on the track and diamond than for them to feel that the student body is with then1. Interest and enthusiasm have always been aroused by these campus meetings. Let there be more of them. THE game on the campus last Saturday with Rochester was an excellent beginning for the sea- son. When the fact is taken into consideration that this was the first game that Union had played and the fourth for Rochester, the cause for satis- faction at the outcome is increased. The game was not only the first one of the season but also the first league game. It was clearly shown that the batting practice that the men received in their games with the second 11ine contributed largely to tnake the score what it was. THE fortieth anniversary of the class of 1861 occurs in June and in accordance with the attempt of this paper to stimulate interest in class re- unions we taJ..;e pleasure in presenting in this issue the names and individual histories of every man of that class. Copies of this issue are being sent to every 1i ving member whose address is known and we hereby assure each alumnus of a hearty reception upon his return in June. In next week's issue will be published the class records of '71, and it is desired that all informa· tion conerning its members be handed in at the earliest. possible date. THE NEW YOI{K TRIP OF THE MUSI- CAL CLUBS. The first concert of the trip was given at the Nelida theatre, Catskill, Wednesday evening, the 24th, where the clubs were greeted by a large audience. The nutnbers were well ren- dered and encores were numerous. E. B. Slack, 'or, as Sousa, was initnitable, and car- ried the audience with l1im every time. The Glee Club never was better, the voic-es hannon- ized well and the selections were catchy and full of humor. The n1andolin and banjo clubs played some very snappy music and were called out again and again. The qnartet was a promi- nent feature of the program and was heartily encored. At Poughkeepsie the clubs gave a matinee in the Masonic Temple, which was very success- ful in every way. In the evening a concert was ,, .,

,, ., THE CONOORDIENSIS. 11 given at FishkiU under the auspices of Col. V. E. Stolbrand, '78, who is connected with the Mt. Beacon military academy, one of the lead- ing institutions of its kind along the Hudson. On Friday evening the clubs entertained a large and very appreciative audience at the Fee Academy of Newburg. 'l'he last concert was given at Carnegie Ly- ceum, New York. The house was, as usual, a large one, and nothing but the most favorable criticism was made of the entertainn1ent. The clubs used all their extra numbers in respond- ing to encores. The result of the Union- Rochester game was announced during the evening, and the applause which followed was very gratifying. For the last ntunber on the progra1n the alumni gathered upon the platform and joined with the Glee Club in the \Song to Old Union.''

On Monday evening last occurred the long deferred contest of the Inter-collegiate Oratori- cal League in the Second Refonned church of this city. Syracuse's representative was Lewis Erwin Carter who ~poke on ''Ingersoll and Moody.\ Rochester was represented by Frederick M. Robinson wl1ose subject was \Henry Ward Beecher and his Relation to the Slavery Question.\ Union's representative was John McNab whose subject was \The Am- bition of Aaron Burr.\ Dr. Hale, in opening the exercises, men- tioned the contests as held in turn at each of the three colleges-Syracuse, Rochester and Union. The theme of the firs~ speaker, Mr. Lewis Erwin Carter of Syracuse University, was '\Ingersoll and Moody.\ Mr. Carter said in part : ''We shall not judge these two men from a theological standpoint, else we must condemn the one and uphold the other. Let us judge them by the consistency of their lives with their creeds and the influence on their fellow men. Both were self-made men, both of wonderful genius; each true to friends and the tender affections of hon1e. \But there was a contrast between them. The one witty and in the same breath sarcastic, a negative force, destroying life, the other a positive force, building up. The one a born orator who could not be surpassed by any tnan of his time. \Ingersoll did not argue against Christianity. He htn·Ied stinging epithets. Sarcasm is not argument. He centered his energy on the medieval conceptions of Christianity. The great agnostic did not live consistently. Dis- respect for every one who disagrees with one is the essence of intolerence. His creed: 'To love. justice, to make others happy, cultivate hope, to see the calm beyond the storm, the dawn beyond the night-a noble creed not un- like the teachings of Christ.'

12 '1'HE CONCORDIE'NSIS. ''But because he cou[d not reason i.t out con- cretely, he was tr~ito1· to it. Ingerson, why did you use your grand eloquence and your rnag- netic influence to ridicu:1e the narn:e and refuse the life of Him who made you ? ''Let us turn to Moody. Words do not do him justice. This only can be done by his memory that lives ~in the hearts of men. He was a king on the platform, cleat·, £orcible, sin- cere; a power in pathos; a .m.an that inspired confideace because he practised what he preached'. He preacl1ed Christ, not denomi- nationalism. lie respected those who disagreed with hi n1, Christians and infidels alike. His strength was as the strength of ten, because his life was pure. ''Agnostic or Christian? The influence on men's lives can best answer this question.\ The next speaker was Mr. Frederick M. Robinson of Rochester, who spoke on \lienry Ward Beecher and his Relation to the Slavery Question.\ . He said briefly: \Great reforms show tvvo phases of develop- ment: 1'he one a gradual drifting away fro1n established customs; the other a period of in- tense act:ivity resulting in the overthrow of those principles against which Christianity l1as arrayed itself. The rebellion was but the cuhnination of a long, slow rnovet11ent through years of ceaseless activity. Henry Ward Beecher did not belong to the pioneer band of anti-slavery agitators. But as he hi fllself said he had 'pre- pared for the figl1t throughout bis vvhole life,' beginning in his college days. He had arrived in Brooklyn before his fame as an orator became ptominent. He gave his congregation to under- stand thnt he would be bound by no precedents. The characteristics of his words were vitality, vivacity and velocity of expt~essjon, coupled with cleanness and humor. H Beecher's voice arose above tile stonn of · the rebellion loud and clear through faith in the ultirnate triumph of the right. He went to England and there battled against tl1e tnovement to recognize the independence of the Southern States.\ Mr. Robinso11 then dramatically pic- tured the wonderfu 1 eloquence of Beecher in his memorable speech on the 16th of October, 1863, at the Philharmonic haH, Liverpool. Mr. John McNab, Union, 1901, spoke next on \The Ambition of Aaron Burr.\ He said in part: ''Formation of character is one of the opportuniHes of youth. Youth is the spring- time of life. Because traits of character are formed that influence after life, the child is in a sense the father of the man. \Aaron. Burr was a quiet tnan, endowed with beauty, wea]th and grace ot tnanner. But these proved tnisfortunes in disguise. His parents died while he was but a child. Thus he catne to know, to love nothing but self. ficed his aU at the altar of atnbition. He sacri- He '\\Tould conquer all at the cost of friendship, respect and honor. \The times were ripe for ambitious gratifi- cation. The revolution gave opportunity to Burr's bold and courageous spirit. Washing- ton admired his bravery hut tnade no attempt to love the rnan. Thus adtnired by the people but distrusted by the government he sought new fields and entered the professiofl of law. He took advantage of the tottering condition of the government. ''He entered politics, reverenced by his friend~, held in awe by his enemies. He was defeated for the presidency by but a single vote. Then his t·eal designs became apparent and he lost his hold on the people. \J:'he shot that ended Hamilton's career sounded his own downfall. Then frotn the ambition w l1ich knew no bounds emanated a scheme for the founding of an empire on the lower Mississjppi with himself at its head. At everything sacred or human his atnbition grasped. With the failure of his cherished scheme his arnbition received its death blow.\ The judges were: Rev. John Sheridan Zelie, Rev. Francis E. Brown and Prof. Arthur Mar- vin, all of Schenectady. About thirty undergraduates assisted Richard Mansfield in his production of \Henry V\ at the Van Curler on last Monday evening. Han1ilton W. Mabie, of the Outlook, the well known writer, will lecture in the· college chapel on Thursday, May 9· His subject has not been announced as yet. ) I· :i ·; \ l ~\

) I· :i ,, \ l ~\ THE CON'CORDIENSIS. 13 SE'COND VICTO~Y ON THE DIAM·OND. Vermont B·eaten by Score of 15-9. The second :game of the season with the Uni- versity of V en.ne>I~t again showed Union's teanl to be made up of good material. Union had played Vermont for a number of years, and this victory is espedally to be appreciated because it is the first titne the Garnet has ever laid low the Green Mountain boys. The day of the game was dark and cloudy with a slight rain., but as the weather did not look serious, the game began with Union in the fie~ld. Witbeck did not get down to work in earnest until the second inning, with a result of three runs to Vern1ont's credit, and three men being left on bases. After that Witbeck got in sotne good worlc, especially in the third inning, when, with two ,men on bases, he struck out three batters in succession. When, to save his arm for the Hobart garne on Friday next, he 1·etired, he had n1ade a record of six men struck out in five innings. Vermont's pitcher, Taylor, showed good forn1, the few hits that were made off him in the early stages of the game being easily fielded. One run was scored by the Garnet players in the first inning. The continued yelling on the bleachers at length caused Taylor to lose his head, for, in the fifth inning he was hit freely, and Union took the lead with two runs to spare. When Vennont came to bat in the sixth, Captain Parker had taken Witbeck's place. Mallery followed Parker in the box. \Chick\ held down the -visitors to three hits, though he also gave one base on balls. Three runs more resulted, making the score 9-5. Taylor \went up in the air\ in the sixth. The first man up to bat hit an easy one to the pitcher who easily got it to first. The next two men secured safe hits and the third was given first on balls. With the bases full, the fourth man was put out on an easy infield fly. After that ten runs came in, among them a home run by Griswold, who n1ade a lucky hit over the terrace, bringing in two or three men. The utnpire, at the end of the sixth inning, called the game on account of darkness. The Vermont b0ys played an almost errorless game until the latter part of the game when they went to pieces. The Union players had one less error tha1I ·their opponents. The score : U. OF VERMONT. A.B. R. 1:B. 1 2 2 3 2 2 1 0 1 1 P.O. A.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS. WHAT THE POUGHKEEPSIE PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE CONCEQT. The Poughkeepsie Eagle says: \ The Glee, Banjo and Mandolin clubs of Union university gave a very good concert on Thursday after- ' noon at Masonic tetnple. Either the public has got used to going out in the rain, or else ' old Union' has plenty of friends in Poughkeepsie, for the hall was well filled and the audience an , enthusiastic one, calling forth n1any encores, to which the clubs responded with the best of good humor. The old college songs are always enjoyed, and perhaps necessary to a first class . glee club concert, and to these were added some new, 'funny' ones, which captivated those present. ' Peter Gray' that old standby, with fresh adorntnent, was very atnusit1g, and the ' Mother Goose Medler ' and the 'Jersey Cow' were especially good. Mr. Barrett, the tenor soloist, has a voice of exceedingly sweet quality and the quartet was adn1irable. The banjo and mandolin clubs when playing together were aided by a flute and violincello, which made a delightful cotnbination. They played the best in the 'Mosquito Parade' and 'Fan Tan.'\ Sabas Meneses, who has been a patient at the Ellis hospital, has so far recovered as to be able to be on the hill last week. The friends of Hawn, r 903, will sytnpathise with him in the loss of his n1other, whose de- cease occurred at 01uar, N. Y., Sunday, April 22. IT FATS .ST\IDENTS Of \QNlO!N\ TO 'TRADE WITH \IS.

The comtnencement exercises of the Albany Medical College were held Wednesday after- noon, May r, at Albany, in Odd Fellows Hall which was crowded to the door. This \vas the seventieth comtnencement in the history of the college. The graduating class consisted of twenty-eight young rnen and was the first to pass over the four-year course inaugurated a few years ago by the Albany Medical College, On the stage were seated President Raymond of Union University, Dr. Albert Vander Veer, dean of the college, Registrar Willis G. Tucker, and the members of the facnltJ and trustees or the college. The members of the graduating class occupied the seats of the first row, directly in front of the stage. They wore caps and gowns. · After the overture by Holding's or- chestra Rev. Williatn Force Whittaker, D.D., offered prayer. . The essay was by Dr. Clayton Kendall Has- kell, zd, oi Albany, and was on \The State and Its Relation to the Consumptive. President Raymond then conferred the degree of doctor of n1edici ne on the twenty-eight young men, first giving them a practical talk. He pointed out to thetn the necessity of their having a good character and a sense of obligation, feeling that they must give the very best they have to the public as its servants. Those who received the degrees are : Charles James Brown, Albany; Arthur Joseph Bedell, Watervliet ; George Samuel Burns, Warsaw ; John Wilson Burns, Albany Rural cemetery ; Robert Beatty Cas tree, Westfield ; Joseph Atn- brose Cox, Albany; Thomas Edward Deveny, Watervliet; John Henry Dingman, Stockport ; Edward Gerald Griffin, Rensselaer; John Michael Griffin, Albany ; Edward Joseph Han- non, Watervliet; Clayton Kendall Haskell, zd, Albany; John Francis IIeffernan, Albany; Arthur }i\:'enw.ick Ho~ding, Albany; Thomas Francis. Judge, I'roy; Jan1es Everett Kelley, Dean's Corners ; Joseph Waldron Moore, Co- hoes; John Berttnan Neary, Watervliet; D~niel Duane Parish, Salem.; Nishan Alexander Pash- ayan, Albany ; William Brink Rosecrans, Nas- sau ; Clarence Leander Sicard, Amsterdam; George AI pheus Smith, Lansingburgb ; Michael Joseph Thornton, A.B., Albany·; Jacob Wachs- man, Brooklyn ; Max Wachsman, Brooklyn ; Leland Odo \Vhite, Fort Plain ; Charles Lan- sing Witbeck, Cohoes. The address to the graduating class which was delivered by Rev. Wallace N. Buttrick, D. D., was both eloquent and interesting. He said it was not always the honor men nor those who carried off the prizes that won fan1e in their profession, for ofttimes the brilliant men were those who could not apply their knowledge to practical use. He said genius counted for naught &ave when it was cotnbined with hard work. If a student had a genius for hard work then he was really endowed and should be suc- cessful. In fact success will come to all who work hard and diligently. The valedictory was by Dr. Arthur J. 13edell, of Watervliet. Professor Samuel E. Ward then read the reports on the appointments and prizes. Drs. MacDonald, Curtis and Van Rensselaer, who co-nducted the competitive examination for h~use physicians and surgeons at the Albany hospital, reported that the following had passed the exan1ination in the order named and would constitute the house staff after June I : First, Dr. M.

MEETING OF THE TENNIS ASSOCI- ATION. A meeting of the Tennis Association 'vas held recently, the object of which was to consider the spring's work and to put the association on a finn basis. A constitution read by Prof. Eddy was adopted. The articles provide for dues of $r .oo per year and regulate the fees required of outsiders to play in any tournament. Rules are laid down for the use of courts by club members. Officers were elected as follows: President- of the association, Fraser Metzger, 'o2 ; Secre- tary-Treasurer, D. E. Griffith, 'o2; chairman of tournament committee, A. S. Raytnond, '02 ; chairman of court cotn mittee, Prof. Eddy. Two tournaments are provided for, one in the spring and one in the fall. Another court is to be put in shape as soon as possible. The offi- cers are to be elected during the winter term to hold office for one year. The 1901 spring tour- nament will begin May 13. The Annapolis crew has engaged Ten Eyck, the world's champion oarstnan, as its head coach.

THE CONC·ORDIENSIS. 9 THIRD VICTORY FOR UNION. Game Characterized by Loose Playing. The catnpus was the scene of another game of the series. of the N. Y. S. T. C. A. U. on May 3· Hobart was pitted against the Union aggregation. The gatne throughout was characterized by loose and careless playing on both sides. Owing to law school examinations, Witbeck, Delaney and Terry were unable to play. Mahar pitched for the first three innings and did good work, considering his first trial in the box. He shut out the visitors from scoring in the second inning. Parker and Mallery pitched the fourth and fifth innings respectively. Then Mahar went in· for the sixth. Hobart had Foley and Foster in the box in the first inning. · Rogers took their place for the rest of the game. The winning of this game gives Union two games won to her credit in the competition for the baseball pennant. The summary follows : P.o. A. E. Struck out-. By Mahar, 3; by Parker 1.

The organi- zation has been put on a strong basis and the managem.ent is doing all in its power to promote a higher order of tennis than has existed at Union for the past few years. Five courts are to be put in condition for playing so there is no excuse on account of lack of room, and the assessn1ent is cer- tainly within the veach of everyone. THE classes of '71 and '76 will hold re-unions this year in celebration of the thirtieth and tw-enty- fifth anniversaries of their respective graduations. This paper has endeavored to secure as complete a list as possible of the doings of the members since their graduation. The fraternities have furnished the larger part of the information .. Copies of this issue will be sent to every member of these classes who is living and whose address CoNCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, $2.00 per Year, in Advance is known. 10 Cents Address all communications to THE CONCORDI- ENSIS, Box 218, Schenectady, N.

WHY should not Union University men have some distinguishing badge or pin ? This is a need which has long been felt by all those who look for- ward to better University feeling, for the creating of a sentiment of loyalty to the University as one's . Alma Mater and not to the particular school or department at which a student is an attendant, or of which he is a graduate. Each one of the Albany departments has a different device in the shape of a distinctive badge.. Would not the adoption of a uniform University pin or e1nblem of some sort do more to foster cordial relations between the several departments than so many banquets or smokers ? Other universities have such a button or pin, with their university initial on a background of their particular university color. Why should not some definite action be· taken by Union men with the above object in view ? ONE phase of college life that is greatly neglec- ted at Union and to which especial attention should be directed is the Young Men's Christian Associa- tion. This work is universally recognized as a very in1portant factor in the college life of to-day. With the beautiful new building, the gift of a loyal alumnus, soon to be opened on the campus, this work cannot fail to arouse interest among the student body as never before. And in this connec- tion mention might be made of the annual North- :field conference. The one to be held this year promises to be more successful than any held be- fore, about six hundred students representing more than one hundred colleges of the United States and Canada have already registered. To anyone who has ever been at Northfield nothing need be said of the advantages to be obtained from a brief stay there but for those who have never had that -pleas- ure and who are thinking at all of going it would be well for them to see the special committee in regard to this. Union for many years sent dele- gations and it is especially important this year that she have as large a number as possible pres- ent. ..

Of those who've left her classic gates, Or those in years to come, Her tablets. can record no class More true th.au Nineteen Otie. '' Refrain. '' Union, Union, nineteen-one; Union, Union, nineteen-one; Union, Union, nineteen-one; We sing a song of thee. '' \We've smoked upon thy terrace fair, As told in songs of yore; We've wandered through thy sun flecked woods And none can love thee more. The whispering pines have heard us laugh, The brook has heard us sigh; With hopes and fears, with smiles and tears, We softly si:ng good bye. ' ' Refrain. \And when :the snows of after years Have settled on our brow, Tho' many will have sunk to sleep Whose voice sings merry now, May all who hold old Union dear- Of those who still remain, Come gather 'neath the great elm tree To sing this old refrain. '' Refrain. --John H. Cook, I9or. UNIVERSITY CLUB OF SCHENECTADY.

Our contest is to see who ca:n make the largest list of names (or kinds) of birds from the fol- lowing list of letters: WDOOOCCKQULIAPRTARIDG ESPNIELVEBRDIMWADOHTL We will reoognize as a bird anything belonging to the feath- ered tribe, whether it be a Hen, Crow, Singer or any other kind. You can use any letter as many times to make. a name as it ap- pears in the list of letters abov:e ; for instance, Woodcock, Plover, Snow Bird, etc. To any person who can make a list of 25 or more different names of birds, we will give absolutely l!,REE a beautiful prize, value 1,000 dols. or less. BlG PRIZES AWAHDED DAILY. When you have made out your list fill out the line on the bot- tom of this advt. and send to us with a Stamped Addressed Envelope, stamp of your country will do; then if you are awarded a prize you can, if you desire, get th.e prize by becom- ing a subscriber to Tke Woman's World. We shall award a prize to every person who sends the name of 25 Birds, and our gifts will be as follows: For the best list, received each day, a Gold Watch; for the second best solution each day, a beauti- ful imported Tea Set; for the seven next best solutions each day, a Konrah Sakih Diamond and Ruby Ring; for the next best solution, a Gold Piece; and for all othet· correct solutions, Prizes of Good Value. These prizes will be forwarded daily ; you will not have to wait a long time in uncertainty before you know the result. There is no element of lottery in our plan. It makes no difference whether we get your solution late or early in the day.

The students, faculty and friends of the college had the privilege of hearing an unasually charm- ing and intellectual lecture by :the well known writer and literary man, Hamilton W. Mabie, on the evening of May 9· The lecture was delivered in the college chapel and was listened to by a Jiarge and appre- ciative audience. Dr. Raymond introduced Dr. Mabie and referred to the recent gathering of literary men in New York to do honor to one of America's foremost n1en of letters, Harnilton Wright Mabie. The lecturer in opening called attention to the crowded condition of the life of the average American and to the consequent lack of titne to cultivate those finer and higher influences that come from a close association with books. Nothing is tnore difficult than to judge of a movetnent when one is in the midst of that movement, the judgment must of necessity be superficial. ''Expert opinion we find out so often is not infallible. Matthe_..w Arnold, many had come to regard as infallible in all his opinions and yet we know how mistaken, how superficial were his views of Americans, and no tnan was so conspicuously misled in regard to the conditions of his times than was he. ''This is so because it is not by painstaking thought but by observation only, that we get the true conceptton of life. No man can under- stand his own age if he studies it from the out- side alone. He must share the experiences of it, his heart must beat with it and he must have within himself the possession of all its great hopes. No man can understand life who is not inspired by it, neither .can any rna:tt know his country who is not in sympathy with it in all its trials. Etnerson and Lowell are exam pies of this sort. Both breathed within this higher ideal and the deep tendencies that strive to con- struct of this rough material, higher uses.'' Dr. Mabie here spoke of the wrong impres- s,ions foreigners receive of America and Ameri- cans through their impressions of the people whom they see and meet on the continent. He told several atnusing stories concerning the American tourist belonging to the neau1Jeau rz·che 'Class. The speaker referred to the materialistic view of life held ~y some Ameri- cans, and asked the question, 'Are we .Ameri- cans Materialists?' \Surely there never was a time when so many and such enormous fortunes were made. 13ut is this our ultimate design? Surely this country was not settled that people might be better fed, better clothed and better housed. Prosperity has no charm of itself. The charm of English society is simplicity of character against a rich background, while here we have this rich background without the simplicity of character,. Wealth never of itself excites any kind of interest. ''No ancient or modern people has had a larger infusion of idealism than our own, for as one travels around this continent, in Canada, at Q_uebec, at Plymouth Rock, in Williamsburg, Virginia, when one is in Charleston, or when one is in the historic city of New Orleans, or in the far West, at the Golden Gate, one finds countless ex:atnples of tnen striving not for lust of gain, but for a better, nobler and purer exist- ence. Wherever spade was turned or log schoolhouse erected thete was found an expres- sion of idealism. \Our governmental systetn rests upon the assumption that every man can be trusted. In such an ordering of society there is shown a deep idealism. In Americans there is an instinctive perception that there is something divine in every human being. It is a well-

6 THE CONOORDIENSIS. known truth that if you treat a man as a man, after awhile he will become a tnan. \There is nothing more beautiful in our liter- ary history than the story of Brook Farm.

Blatch- ford prize, 2nd; Ingham., Clark, 1st.

This is always expressed frotn Etnerson down to the poen1s of Moody published the other day. It is all saturated with idealism.\ , at Columbia Law School in 1884; practiced law in New York city ever since; is at present a member of the la. w firm of Nicholl, An able and Lindsay, No. 31 Nassau St. Resides at Livingston, Staten Island, corner Bard avenue and North St. GIFT TO ENGINEERING LABORATORY. Mr. C. P. Steintnetz of the General Electric Co., has recently pt·esented to the electrical engineering laboratory several hundred dollars worth of apparatus. The gift consists of one one-half horse power three phase induction n1otor, a three phase rotary converter, a three phase variable ratio tJ·ansformer besides several 1ninor pieces of appat·atus such as switches, etc. Prof. Eddy some time ago asked Mr. Steinmetz for a temporary loan of the apparatus but when it came a note frotn Mr. Steinmetz accotnpanied it stating that he wished to present it as a gift. The apparatus was his own private property. It constitutes for the department a peculiarly valuable gift and is deeply appreciated. The electrical engineering laboratory has been the recipient of several gifts of apparatus during the year atnounting in value to some- thing over one thousand dollars n1ainly acquired through the efforts of Prof. Eddy. The coach con11nittae fo1· the football team for this year has been appointed and consists of F. W. Hild, '98; S. G. H. Turner, '98; P. B. Yates, '98; H. J. Hinman, '99; W. VanVlack. 19co, and H. J. Brown, 'oi. This cotnmittee has already written and sent out letters to alumni soliciting subscriptions and it is hoped by this . means to secure enough money to insure the assistance of a good coach.

Y., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414: State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THE Concordiensis presents in this issue the histories of the classes of '81 and '86 which will hold reunions in June. The material concerning the class of '81 was obtained from Dr. William M. White, '81, of Amsterdam through whose untiring efforts the reunion of his class will be a success. The records of the class of '86 were obtained mainly from the fraternities. WITHIN the past week a set of bleechers has been erected on the campus due to the efforts of the atheletic association. These seats fill a long-felt want of the college and it is hoped that they will help materially in increasing the number of spec- tators at the games on the campus. And in con- nection with this attention is called to the fact that the old benches will be hereafter reserved for the teams and the official scorers. THE catalogue and prospectus of the Albany Law School for the coming year has just appeared. It is a well arranged, nicely gotten up booklet and sets forth the ad vantages of the school in a most attractive way. Numerous cuts of distinguished members of the faculty brighten the pages, each one accompanied by a short sketch. There are also cuts of President McKinley, of the class of '67, and Justice Brewer, of the U,. S. Supreme Court, a graduate in the class of '58. Full information is given regarding the amount of work to be done before a student is fitted to try the State Bar axaminatiori. Courses of one or two years duration are offered with correspondingly longer or shorter periods of offlce study. '' From 1851-1898 the academic course was one year, pre- ceded or supplemented by one or more years in a law office. In 1898 the trustees and faculty extended the course to two years of not less than eight months creating a junior and a senior year, in deference to requirements of the State Board of Regents.'' During the last three years, consider- ably over one hundred graduates of the school have entered the examination for the bar, only two of whom have failed to pass their first examina- tion.'' A list of the graduates in 1900 is given, among whom we note the name of Turner, College '98. Among the members of the senior and junior class, which number seventy-two and. sixty-four respectively, appear the names of a number of Union men, Eames,. '99; Hinmau, '99; Bender, 1900; Reilly, ex-1900; Bon estelle, ex:- '99; Fenton, 1900; Holcome, '98; Hubbard, 1900; Paige, 1900; Pike, 1900 and Read, 1900. At the suggestion of this paper to Mr. Davison, Secretary of the faculty, the degrees and the names of the colleges or universities attended were added to the names of former college students. Forty-one college men are attendants at the law school and twenty-one different institutions of learning are represented. The formal opening of Silliman Hall will take place probably on June 7, not on May 24, as was given in one of the daily papers. The program of exercises will be announced later. . i t . ' ,'

In the death, on 1\farch 22, i9o1, at his hon1e in Toledo, Ohio, of Judge Joshua R. Seney, Union College has lost one of the most intellec- tual of its alumni, Judge Seney was graduated in ir86o,. with high classical honors; an1ong thetn being ~mem- bership of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. . He was the first Ohio Judge to allow a negro to sit as a juror, and he decided, while judge of the Court of Common Pleas, that a woman was as much entitled to a clerkship as a man. It is due to this decision that won1en a1·e today etnployed in the various clerical positions of the city, county and state of Ohio. Judge Seney was a brilliant classical scholar. His marvelous metnory and great conversational power gave hitn a delightful personality. Familiar with the poets of the world, and with its best literature, possessed of a keen sense of humor, and a heart rich in senthnent he was a rare companion within his home, and outside of it. He \\-Vas a leader at the bar in his own state and an intellectual stimulus to all who came in contact with him. For eleven years he had been a great sufferer from ill-health. During this period his vvife, the sister of Americus V. Rice of Ottawa, Canad~, Union, '6o, proved a more than ordi- nary helpmate. She is known throughout the State of Ohio as the Superintendent of the Reg- istry Department of the Postoffice. Her con- duct of affairs in this departn1ent is quoted as one of the few instances of the kind in the history of the country. Judge Seney came of good colonial stock. His paternal grand-~lather served on the bench as Chief Justice of Maryland, and his great- grandfather on the maternal side was Commo- dore Nicholson, cotnmander-in-chief of the navy during the revolution. His blood was TQUSTEE MEETING. , good and his life was better-a credit to his . At the last meeting of the Board of Trustees held April 30, Instructor Eddy was n1ade assistant professor of electrical engineering. At this meeting leave of absence was granted to Prof. Opdyke for two years of study abroad at the end of which titne he will be taken back and given the full professorship of Mechanics and Physics. Prof. Opdyke will leav·e in June for Europe where he will spend two years in the English and German universities. su·es. We are glad that he was an alumnus of Union. He, himself, cherished fond memories of her, often dwelling upon them in his later years of enforced invalidism. Once he wandered over these old Union grounds-a thoughtful student -going to the class-room of the Professor, or tningling in the student life around him, with youth and laughter in his veins. Now all is over-the student, the scholar, the jurist has reached a better country-but, in departing, he has left a just name and fame it1 the state of which he was a citizen. His excellence of life might stimulate many an alumnus of Union to go and live like him. *' ~. \ ·1·\'. '. I~ ' I. ,. [t I I t

~. \ THE CONOORDIENSIS. 13 GILM.OUQ-· TQUAX WEDDING. A College Affair. Miss Lillian Blanche Truax Married to Jlobert F. Gilmour, ' 1894· The house of Prof. James R. Truax and Mrs. 'Truax was the scene on the evening of May 14, of a beautiful tnarriage ceremony, the con- ttacting parties being Miss Lillian Blanche Truax only daughter of Prof. James R. r.rruax, '76 and Mrs. Truax and Mr. Robert Fuller Gilmour, '94· The historic old house in North College, with its decoration of pink and green, never looked prettier, and it is doubtful if a more beautiful wedding ever took place on the college grounds. The ceretnony took place at :8 o'clock being an adaption from the old Dutch form and was performed by Dr. A. V. V. Raymond. A large number of ii-iends, relatives and invited guests were present. The bride was attended by Mrs. William G. Giltnour, matron of honor and entered leaning on the arm of her father. The groom was attended by his brother, William G. Gilmour, '88. After the ceretnony refreshments were served and dancing enjoyed until a late hour. Mr. and Mrs. Giltnour left on a late train for an extended trip through the East and South. The bride is well known in Schenectady society, having made her debut several seasons ago. Mr. Gilmour is likewise well known in the social circles of the city. He is a graduate of the Union Classical Institute and a graduate of Union College in the class of 1894· He it a member of the Sigma Phi society and of the Mohawk club and holds a responsible position in the Schenectady Locomotive Works. The guests from out of the city were Mr. and Mrs. Allan Gilmour, Mrs. Allan Gilmour, Jr., Mrs. Williatn H. Gibson, Miss Gibson, Mrs. McEwen Pruyn, Mr. Francis Pryun, all of Albany; Dr. Andrew Gilmour of New York ; Mrs. James Gilmour, Fulton; Miss Isabella G. Clancy, Amsterdam ; and Mr. Fred Coons of Troy. The gifts to the bride were of great number and richness. Mr. and Mrs. Gilmour will be at home the first and second Tuesdays in June, at Union College. CHI P.SI DAN·CE. The Chi Psi fraternity gave its annual spring dance Friday evening, May 10, in Yates' boat- house. In spite of the fact that the weather conditions were very unfavorable, a great many of the invited guests were present and the affair was a great success. For five hours the· merry crowd danced to the strains of Gioscia's orches- tra and when it was over they left with regret. Those present were Mrs. Bensen, Miss Taylor, Albany; Niss Rulison, Watervliet; Miss Mc- Clellan, Cambridge; Miss Sligh, Grand Rapids; and from the city, Mrs. J. T. Schoolcraft, Mrs. C. F.
