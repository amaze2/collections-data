The Concordie11sis VoL. XXIV. UNION COLLEGE, MARCH 7, 1901. No. 20. \THE MAN AND THE BOOK \ . . Lecture By Qobert Bridges, of Scribner's Magazine. Mr. Robert Bridges, one of the editors of Scribner's Magazine, delivered one of the finest lectures of the term in the chapel on Friday afternoon on the subject, ''The Man and the Book.\ Mr. Bridges possesses an excellent delivery. His interesting manner of treating his subject and his reputation as a man of letters ·Combined to tnake his lecture of unusual interest. Doctor Raymond introduced him, referring to his appearance here son1e years ago. Mr. Bridges began by quoting from an essay from Stevenson's \'1fen and Books\ in which the author says \Language is but a poor bull' s eye lantern wherewith to show off the vast cathedral of the world.\ ''Literature is essential to life and should be an incentive to arouse man frotn its routine, and the use of men of letters is to reflect the feelings of humanity. HIt takes a great deal to arouse man fron1 the inanity of everyday life and books, above all, should accotnplish this. Any talk about a man or a book should be about the average and not the phenon1enal as the fonner is more common and on this account of more interest. The man who really lives must be active and throw hitnself with his whole energy into the work which he is doing. \It does no one any good to tell hhn what the principles are that governed the life of Napoleon and how Napoleon did when one knows that he has no possible chance of becotning a Napoleon. \You can apply the same principle in regard to the attitude of men to their work in ordi- nary walks to the literary man. There are two kinds of men-those who are in the great pro- cession and who do not know the general trend of the procession, do not know when they pass by noted points. The other class is the one that , stands on the corner and cheers or jeers, encour- . ages or shoots putty at the passers-by. This 'class is the literary class, and the majodty of those who shoot putty are the critics. Here is where the utility of the man of letters comes in. He interprets the procession for those who plod along, the meaning of the whole thing to the procession. He cheers and so helps, he gives to the crowd some intellingence of the tout ensenzble: and he sheds light for the leaders in the great march. And all that he has to do it with is his poor bull's-eye lantern of language. \Language is but a series of inherited pic- tures and the man of letters is the one who puts tl1ese together into a harmonious whole. Pro- fessor Lounsbury in a recent editorial says that the modern newspaper English is the best for it is vital, it is so because the newspaper man is brought into actual contact with men, because he is engaged in watching the stream of life. He is the first to see the new shades of meaning and all this must n1ake him efficient as an expo- nent of the best mode of expression. This is :iln impossibility tor the cloistered man of letters. A real literary n1an has a passion for perfection in phrase. The business of literature is to tnake the flame in the lantern of life to burn as brighty as possible. \The mind of the 1nan of letters is like that of an engineer in its high degree of development. The same principle is carried out in their work, for example, a bridge, in regard to its form, balancing and strength. The judgment is not sin1ply on the beauty but also on the utility.\ Mr. Bridges gave Poe as an example of a genius who was ordinarily pitied, but in fact he is to be congratulated. Rather than being an unfortunate child of genius he was very fortun· ate. Almost a mere foundling he was adopted by one of the oldest and best families in the South, educated at the best University in the South, and afterwards sent to West Point, the

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. best military school in the country, and in all he failed to improve his opportunities. But this has nothing to do with his genius and with the judgment of his genius. , wen as in its unutterable beauty and joy, ar:d i read in this connection Stevenson's poem,. ''God if this were Enough,\ and gave his estimate of , Stevenson in this as being the true a1-tist in the · deepest problem of his race. Mr. Bridges : 'closed his interesting lecture by reciting an \The true man of letters is the one who takes his hard knocks with the rest of his fellows. Tennyson, Longfellow, Parkman, Stevenson, were great men as tne.n, they would have been great men had they never written a line. They didn't go through life whining. They took life , with its husks without the corn, the shell with- out the oyster. \The mere craft of joining thoughts together in such a way as to give temporary pleasure is a ! very common acquirement. This is an age of · ''pianola poetry.\ The land is filled with petty versifiers and magazine offices are flooded with their productions, but the true man of letters is a rare person. There are hundreds of interest- ing books but they are for the most part worth· less as far as any good they do is concerned. A true example of the literary genius who shows depth and natural art is Stevenson. Although ' handicapped by physical infirtnities that would discourage most writers, he continued to write of life as though he could see the beauty and feel the joy in it-all of which he did in spite of his suffering. The man of letters should be able to laugh with his fellows, at them and at himself, and yet retain that sweet and charitable spirit that refrains frotn pessitnistic criticistn.\ Mr. Bridges made the witty retnark that tnuch of his lecture was stolen from a literary person- age, now deceased, known to the \\Vorld as '' Droch,\ whose literary executor he was, and that all that was good in his lecture was his own and all that was bad was \Droch's.\ . alt is seldom the case that an author's tnaster- piece is the one that the author thought to be his best, but it serves as a stepping--stone to later work, is on the way towards the real master- piece. 'Adam Bede' was on the way towards ' Savronola,' 'Kidnapped' was on the way to- wards 'Weir of Hermiston,' 'The ]un1ping Frog' on the way towards 'Yankee in King Arthur's Court.'\ Continuing Mr. Bridges said that he believed in the unutterable pathos and tragedy of life as original poem. SIGMA PHI BANQUET. The annual banquet of Sigma Phi was held at the Ten Eyck last Friday evening. Alumni and undergraduates from Union, Wil- Hatns and Han1ilton attended. DeLancey W.

D~. RA. YMOND'S ~EPLY. His Answer to the '·New York Sun's\ Unfavorable Comment on th.e Engineering School Bill. The \Sun\ recently contained an edito1·ial en the proposition to found a State School ()[ Etec- trical Engineering at _ Union. The wri-ter evidently had hastily examined the bill and its intent, for he could not find a single argu- ment in its favor, and did not present a single argument against it. He simply advised ''kill- ing\ it. President Raymond's attention was called to the article, and he accordingly wrote the \Sun\ a letter in answer, which that pape1· prornptly published. The letter states concisely the arguments for the establishment of the school and is therefore copied below. \An editorial article entitled \A Good Bill to . Kill' which appeared in your issue ofThu1·s(}ay, Feb. 2 r, prompts me to send you a W()rd of explanation which tnay make the bill seem less 'preposterous.' \Your clear statement of the provisions ofthe provisions of the bill leaves nothing to be desired in that particular. It proposes to btti 1 1d and equip a state electrical laboratory at Uni()n college and to provide for its maintenance and for the work of experimentation and instt·ncti()n. The college is to deed to the state the land needed for the laboratory and to offer to students resident in the state one hundted free scholar- ships in electrical engineering. The passage of such a bill would be justified by certain c<>n- sideratioas which I wish to call to your atten- tion. ''Electrical science, still new, and but par- tially developed, is already of comrnandi11g importance to the state, since it enter~ m<>re largely than any other science into indu -stl'ial, commercial and domestic life, and it is certa.in to become more closely identified with public interest by its application to new uses. Evety thought of the future puts an emphasis upon this science that is given to n<> other. We ha-ve but to realize that all the water power .of tl1e state is be.in;g rapidly utiHzed for fhe develop- ment of electrical energy to- see at once how vital is the reilation between electrical science and public ·interests. This alone is enough to justify the state in fostering directly a study of this science on the san1e principle it11at has led ·· to the ·establishment by state ·endowtnent at Cornell university ofa state school of fo·restry, a state veterinary coHege, and a sta;te biological laboratory. ''A second consideration is the increased legislation that will be demanded as electrica·I science progresses. Property ;must be pro- tected and life safeguarded. Fort he enactment of right and necessary laws the state should have an .independent and authoritative source of imforn1ation free from the rivahies of commer- cial interests. \A thit·d and most important consideration is the need of an official standardizing labora- tory for electt·i:cal 1neasuring instruments. No such laboratory exists today and the demand for it increases every year. ''If it is admitted, for the above t·easons, that the state should be justified in establishing an electrical laboratory the question ·of location is still open. Why should Union college be chosen? Because the works ()f the General Electric company, the largest in existence, 1nake Schenectady the most natuJ·al place in the state, if not tn the country, for an experitnental station and for investigation and instruction in electrical science. Union college has the oldest engineering school connected with any college in America. It has already a fitlly organized departn1ent of electrical engineering. It is by its charter absolutely undenominational and, therefore, free from the constitutiona1l provision agai ns state aid to sectarian institutions.\ BASKETBALL SCHEDULE. . March 2r .- V. A.

NEW UNIVEQSITY CATALOGUE. Publication Just Issued a ,Splendid Adver- tisement for the University. 'I'he University catalogue for 1900-1901, has just made its appearance. It is a large b?ok. of 170 pages and is the most comple~e p~bhcatl~n of its kind ever issued by the Untverstty. Stx- teen pages are devoted to the University calen- dar, officers and faculty; 82 to the academic department; 25 to the School of Engineering; · 18 to the Albany Me·dical College ; 14 to the Albany Law School ; 1 I to the Albany College of Pharmacy, and 2 to the Dudley Observatory. The curriculum and requiretnents of every department are fully presented, and complete lists of officers, faculty, and undergraduates are inserted. A count of the undergraduates reveals the fact that 519 students are now in attendance at the various departments, and that the faculty con- sists of 91 men-an extretnely large proportion for any university. The law department has the largest enrolment in its history. A resume follows: FACULTY.

Next year the entrance requirements will be· the same as heretofore, but in 1902 physics will be also required in the scientific and engineering courses. The cata- logue says in regards to this that the following preparation in physics is necessary: \An elementary knowledge of physics, such as tnay be gained by a year's course of study covering mechanics, sound, heat, light and elec- tricity. Preparations should include individnal laboratory work, attested by a note-book, com- prising at least thirty-five exercises, chiefly quantitive.\ Formerlv a man has been admitted into the B. S., B. E., and Ph. B. courses on either one year of French or German. In 1901 the requirement will be in Gennan, instead of French or German. But in 1903 a two year's study in German will be required as the candi- date will have to have read 300 pages of stan- dard German prose and poetry before being admitted which will tnean two year's work for the ordinary student.

Annual Event Takes Place at Centennial Hall on .March 16. The annual concert of the Musical Association occurs at Centennial Hall, in Albany, on Satur- day evening, March I 6. Manager Brown is making extensive preparations to have this con- cert the best attended one given in years. A large number of patronesses from Albany society have consented to lend their aid. A large com- mittee of Union alumni has also been formed. Tl1e managetnent is atten1pting to make the concert a university affair. Several tnen from the professional schools will participate as mem- bers of the clubs. Committees have been formed in the Albany departments to further interest in the a.ffai r. The farce \Found in a Four-Wheeler,\ or \Cabman 93,\ has been cut from the program, as the 1nanagen1ent desit·es to have the concert entirely musical in nature. Tl1e list of patronesses include a nutnber of pron1inent Albany society matrons, atnong thetn being Mrs. Benjamin E .. Odell, jr., Mrs. Tim- othy L. Woodruff, Mrs. John V. L. Pruyn and several others. Well-known Albanians who will serve on the comtnittee are: Charles E. Patterson, '6o, AtnasaJ. Parker, '63, J. Newton Fiero, '67, Andrew Hamilton, '75, Samuel B. Ward, '62, and Willis G. Tucker, '7o. CITY LIB~ARY ON UNION· ST:QEET. The College Sells the City :a Lot in the Pasture for $l2,0:0t0. The $s.o,ooo library which Aadrew Carnegie has promised the city of Schenectady, will he erected upon a portion of the college pasture fronting on Union street. 'rhe negotiations were brought to a head after a number of con- ferences between the resident members of the Eoard of Trustees and a con1n1ittee of the local Library Association. The college originally asked $I5,ooo for the lot, while the Association offered $Io,ooo. A cotnpromise price of ·$r 2,- ooo was finally agreed upon. It is understood that the land would never have been sold for any other purpose. The new :lihrary will be situated at the foot of the hill and will be of such an attractive appearance that the college ·will be none the loser by its erection. The site is an ideal one. Students of the college will have equal advantages with residents of the city in the use of the library. The lot is situated seventy-five feet east of the grounds of Dr. Pearson and is one hundred by one hundred and fifty feet in size. Enough frontage is allowed on Union street to allow of the extension of Quackenbos steeet at sotne possible future titne. The $1 2,.ooo needed for the purchase of the land will be raised by popu- lar subscription and lists for that purpose will be left in the principal stores and hotels in the city. The building when completed will be one of the finest library buildings in this part of the state and will be equipped with every modern convenience. The equipment of the building is in charge of an enthusiastic committee which intends to make it as complete in every line as possible. The men1bership com mit tee has met with great success in the canvass for members and the desired roll of 1,500 will doubtless be obtained in a short time. A sch()ol-children's membership ticket is being talked of and will in all probability become a feature in the near future. The committee is anxious to raise the membership list as high as possible and it is earn- estly desired that any who have not joined the association do so at once.

THE Board of Governors of the University are to be congt-atulated upon the fine appearance of the catalogu.e just issued, and upon the increased space gi-ven in it to the professional departments at Albany. An ex:ap1ination reveals but a single omission which, we believe, takes a\Way from the complete- ness of tll~ book. In the list of students of the Medical College, no menti()n is made of the college from which the fourteen men with academic de- grees ha.ve graduated, and in that of the Law School a.nd College of Pharmacy, there is no indi- cation that the undergradn.ates have ever attended a college. As a tnatter of fact, there are very few such men in the latter department, but in the for- mer twenty-nine have graduated from higher instituti()US of learning. Ha.rvard takes particular pride in pointing to the larg-e proportion of Yale men in her College of Law, an.d other professional schools seize the opportunity of indicating the fact that they attract college men to them. Such infor- mation is of value to the matTiculant. Would it not be interesting to such men. to know that the Albany Law School has stude1.11ts at the institution who have graduated from Ya.le, Rochester, Col- gate, Syracuse, St. Lawrence,. Harvard, Vermont, Wesleyan,. Hamilton, Hobart, Princeton, Amherst, Glascow and Pennsylvania? Perhaps such infor- mation would be the means of ~tfracting addition- al recruits from these or other colleges~ UNION vs. DARTMOUT'H MEDICAL. Fast Basketball Promised for Saturday Evening .. The basketball contest witl1 the five from the Dartnlo'.tth .Medical college at the Armory, Saturday evening, promises to be weU worth witnessing. The Union five showed up in good shape last week when the Victory Athletic club of Schuylerville was easily taken into camp. Dartmouth ha& a fast team which will rnake the men in Garnet work for every basket. John W. H. Pollard, a sophotnore at the Medical col- lege, who arranged the match, pron1ises Captain Thebo a hard contest. The Union line-up will probably be as fol- lows : Forwards, Anders(}n. and Cronkhite; center, Olmsted; guards, M~llety and Pearce. The sub5titutes are Sherrill and Gould. l-Iard daily practice should put the men in the best of condition. SENIOR VACAfiON. The facufty has made the announcement that all works of the present senior class will con- clude Wednesday, May 22. This will give rgor men the vacation of th1~ee weeks usually allowed the senior class. The further announce- ment is n1ade that, in the future, the vacation will be ten days shorter. In that case, senior vacation nex:t year will comtnence on the second Saturday before cotnmencem~nt,

THE OONCORDIENS'IS. 11 ELECTRICAL SCIENTIFIC LABOQ- ATO~Y. What the \Amsterdam Democrat\ Thinks of It. behalf of Union college. It is pro\Vi<J:ed in the , bill that the state is to have the :disposal of a large number of free scholarships in the col- lege's course of electrical engineering, a hun- , dt·ed or a hundred and twenty-five. The -satne provision is in operation at the ' above mentioned state-assisted departm,ents of The few new.spapers here and there in this , Cornell university. As in the case of Cornell, state that have published articles opposing the these scholarships are to be a pportiond among proposed grant by the legislature to Union col- the legislative districts of the state, and to be lege for establishing a departm,ent of electt·icity, awarded to a~piring students in e lrectricity by have based their oppositions mainly on the fear cotnpetitive examination. that if one institution or one branch of science is thus favored, future legislatures will be beset by special educational interests for state assis- tance at this and that college all over the state. In this argurnent no consideration is given to the fact that ahnost all the colleges and aca- demies in the state are excluded by the constitu- tion frotn receiving financial assistance at the hands of the legislature. Such is the effect of the section which prohibits the legislature from granting aid to any sectarian institution. Union college, like Cornell, and a few other universities aud colleges in tl1e state, is abso- lutely undenon1inational, and always has been during the hundred and five years of its exis- tence. l'he san1e newspapers all fail to notice that the principle upon which this Union college bill in the legislature is based, is the satlle as that which the legislature in years not far back found sound, when it voted substantial aid to to the State School of Forestry, State Schoo} of Veterinary Science, and the State Biological Loa bora tory, all adjuncts of Cornell university. Can it be said that any one of these sciences which Cornell is thus exceptionally well pre- pared to teach is of more general applicability to the practical needs of today than the science of electricity? And where else in the United States are such hnportant advantages to be found for the success of an electrical laboratory as at Schenectady, where the General Electric Company's works are established? And the cotnpany has expressed a willingness to lend as~istance in details of the operation of such a department at Union college. lt is not entirely a free gift that is proposed in TIMFS-U·NION EDITORJAL. Albany Paper Approves the Electrical School Bill. The Albany \Titnes-Union a Detnocratic nevvspaper, speaks editorially of tb.e bill for the establishment of an electrical engineering school at Union, as follo·ws: ''A bill is pending in the senate a.ppropriating $I5o,ooo for the erection and equipment of a laboratory of electrical engineering in connection ' with Union college in the city of Schenectady. The state is to have the title to th ~ land and twenty-five four-year free scholarsh.ips annually in electric engineerin'g at the coU ege. The selection of Union college is detenn.i ned by the fact that the great works of the Ge~eral Electric company are situated in Schenectad:r, and from them extraordinary facilities are to be obtained. The bill is worthy of the support of every vote. The object is a good one and it would not be long before its beneficial results vvou 1d be felt if . b 1 \ 1t · eca me a a w. August H. Kruesi, '98, Wednesday afternoon delivered a very interesting address before the engineering students of Union college on the subject \'Speed Regulation of Steam Engines.\ Mr. Kruesi has t·ecently returned from a two years' residence abroad in the interest of the English branch of the General Electric Com- pany, and has given especial attention to the subject covered by the paper.

12. THE OONOORDIENSI8. UNIVEQSITY C:LUB:S. Movements on Foot in Albany and Dorp to Establish Such Organizations. College ~men in both Albany and Schenectady are interested in movements to :establish U ni- versity clubs in both cities. The idea is to organize on a basis similar to that of the Uni- versity club of New York dty, the necessary qualifications for metnbershrp being that can- didates shall be co liege graduates. Schenectady has an extrernely large propor- tion of college rnen an1ong its :residents. Hun- dreds of men in the General E1ectric works are graduates of colleges and technical schools. But one club, the Mohawk, now exists in this city. Those who have the idea in mind claitn a Uuiversity Club would attract a large Inem- bership at the very start. Union, of course, has the largest representation of n1en in town, but Cornell, Yale, Lehigh M. I. T., Stevens, Tufts and Lafayette have !large delegations. Columbia, Virginia, Harvard, R. P. I., Kansas, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Syracuse, Brown, Rutgers, Vermont, Wesleyan, Michigan, Col- gate and tnany others are also represented. The projectors of such a club in Albany call attention to the fact that the pt·oportion of col- lege graduates in the city is lat·ge and that there \-Vould be no difficulty in obtaining plenty of desirable n1etnbers. The idea is to form a t~eg· ularly established club like the Fort Orange or ... t\.lbany or Press clubs, and raise enough rnoney to build a house. Such an organization, it is said, would fill a want not supplied by the Press club, which has becon1e an association of young mercantile men almost entirely; nor the Albany club, which has grown to be the ren- dezvous of political elen1ents, nor the Fort Orange, which is ruled by the older men of the city's most aristocratic families. G. LeRoy Shelley, 1901, has resigned his position as leader of the Glee club. S. B. Howe, Jr., 1903, has been appointed to fi.Il the vacancy. !; PQOF. HOLLIS ON ATHLETICS. The following appeared in a recent number of the ''Boston Record\ and will be of interest to those wbo knew Prof. Ira N. Hollis, who was instructor of mechanical engineering at Union from 1881 to i88f.. It will also be of especial interest as it is the view tal{en by one of the prominent professors of Harvard in regard to athletics. The article refers to a speech he made at aU niversity of Pennsylvania dinner: '' When Prof. Hollis of Harvard talks athletics he does not tnince matters. His statement at the U. P. dinner last night that a university is founded to protnote learning, not to furnish candidates for the arena, is true and it is right. Prof. Hollis goes further in his analysis than any of his predecessors and looks into the prepara- tot·y school for causes. He savs : ol 4 ' 'The object of atnateur athletics in inter- collegiate sports, is one of education. It is only within the last three or four years that we are recovering frotn the old feeling that amateurs and professionals could list together. To day it rnay be. considered legitimate to go into the pre- paratory schools to pluck the fairest blossoms from the athletic field. It seetns to tne there is n()thing more vicious than to go ililto the secon- dary schools and solicit a young giant. 'Of course there is the spirit to win. The system is not itn tnoral, yet it is one step towards the fonnation of teams of gladiators that would be unconquerable. Some universities conquer by failure. It does not decrease attendance for we have failed rnore than anyone else. 'There is great promise betw€en the univers- ities for the future, for the upbuilding of ama- teur sports. It is a work, a system of taking freshmen and telling then1 what is right and what is not. He does not know by instinct, but learns by experience.'

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS. THE ALUMNI COLUMN. '97.---After a vacancy of nearly eighteen months, during which a great many candidates passed in review· before the congregation, the consistory of the North Reformed church of Watervliet has extended a unanimous caU to Rev. Orlando B. Pershing, pastor of the Presby- terian church at Cato. Rev. Mr. Pershing was born at Ashland, Ohio, 1\!Iay 19, 1871. In r887 l1e retnoved with his parents to North Madi,son, Ohio. The thirst for know ledge and a desire to enter the ministry drove hin1 frotn the fann to begin unaided his educational caree·t~. After a brief nonnal training at Scio college he was engaged as teacher in the school district near his hotne, which position he held for two successive years. In r893, having secured a first class scholarship, he en tet·,ed Union, fTO·tn which he was graduated with l1igh standing in I 897. At the beginning of th.e senior yeat\ at Union he was asked to supply the pulpit of the Reformed church of Glen. It was with enthu- siastn, therefore, that he entered the theological seminary of the Refonned churcl1 at New Bruns- \-Vick, N. ]., in Septernber of '97· The New Jersey clitnate not being congenial, the fall of 'g8 found hitn hard at work in H1e Auburn theo- logical setninary. Graduating frotn Auburn, he accepted a call fro1n the Presbyterian church of Cato, and on May 15, 1900, was ordained and installed pastor by the Pre-sbytery of Cayuga. In July of the same year he was n1arried to Miss Kate Cum- nlings of Madison, Ohio, the girl of his early love, now a W())man of rare gifts and literary culture. He bas won a large place in. the confidence and affections of the people of Cato, and it is with keen tegtet that the pastoral t·elations are so soon to be severed. Rev. and Mrs. Pershing will remove to vVatervliet about April first and occupy the parsonage adjoining the church, which is now being fitted up for tbeir reception. CAMPUS NOTES.

Moss, '28, who was con1monly believed to be the oldest graduate of Union and who was the oldest mernber of Kappa Alpha, the oldest college fraternity, died at New Berlin, N.Y.,, on March 2. M·r. Moss was consistently loyal to his alma mater throughout his life and tnany 1tin1es showed his deep interest in her wel- fare. A New Berlin paper says of hin1: \HoraceO. Nlosswas born Jan. 18, r8o9, at White Store, a hatnlet on the Unadilla river, about 12 miles south of New Berlin, where his father,. Mr. Joseph Moss, carried on a trading business, furnishing to the early settlers such things as were needful to them, taking in return their :soda ash, which was about the only mer- chantable product of their toil. \Into the hardships of this frontier life was the subject of this sketch born, and who can tell but that the struggles of those early days, was in part at least, the discipline which wrought the sturdy tnanhood that future years developed? \In 1812 the fatnily moved to New Berlin, where JVIr. Joseph Moss becatne manager of the Farmers & Mechanics Mfg Co., which from a stnall beginning in a wooden cotton tnill, grew to a large and prosperous business and for forty years was the chief industry in this township. During these years of prosperity, there was visi- ble tl1e hand of Mr. H. 0. Moss, who becatne manager and whose business skill and integrity contributed largely to the success of this busi- ness enterprise. \In the early fifties, Mr. Moss established a banlnng house in Sandusky, 0. This business was carried on successfully until the establish- ment of National banks, when this institution was among the first to receive a charter, and becarne the First National Bank of Sandusky. He retained an interest in this bank until his death. \As a business rnan he was successful, having the confidence and respect of all who knew him. Mr. Moss had the advantage of a good education, opportunities for which were not as fav()rable then as now. He attended school at Hartwick Seminary, was a student at Harn:ilton coliege 1825-27, and graduated at Union college in 1828. At the tin1e of his death he was the oldest living graduate of any American uuz\versity. We clip the following from the 'Boston Transcript' of January 26 : \'Mr. Moss resides at New Berlin, N. Y., and gives daily attention to his rnany business interests. In November last was observed at Schenectady, N. N., the seventy-fifth anniver- sary of the founding of Kappa Alpha-the first of the Greek letter college fraternities. Mr. Moss' name was placed at the l1ead of the com- mittee of arrangetnents. Mr. Moss did not ven- ture to participate in the three-day festival, but by several letters, delightfully retniniscent, and each containing a check for expense account, he made it evident that he is still an enthusiastic fraternity and college n1an.' ~'As a citizen be ahvays manifested a deep interest in the welfare of our village. He was one of the promoters of the New Berlin Aca- demy, aiding in the purchase of the site and the construction of the building. He set·ved as secretary of the board of trustees for several years, and often helped to save the institution from financial disaster. He was one of the sub- stantial factors in getting both the 0. & W. and the Unadilla Valley R. R. into our village. It was largely his patrio_tic spirit that secured the beautiful soldiers' tnonutnent which crowns Cen1etery hill-he took great pleasure in furnish- ing the site, and building the foundation for that structure-a foundation that has stood for eigh-

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. teen years without the slightest deHectiou, so well was the work done. \To every worthy object he has been a ,gener- ous contributor. ''He was a .finn fri,end of the governtne:nt in the dark days of the civil war. In poHtics he was .a staunch republican. Above all he was an earnest Christian, wl1ose loyalty to his church ' was proven by his faithful attendance and liberal: support. \Mr. Moss was n1arried Sept. 30, r 832 to Emeline B. Knapp, daughter of Mr. Charles Knapp, one of the early settlers of New 13edin. She died Feb. 23, 1845, leaving two daughters and one son, of wbotn only the son, Charles, residing in Sandusky is now living. In 1.846 he \Vas united in n1arri~t'ge to Isabel White, daugh- ter of the late Samuel White of this place. Mrs. Moss died about a 111 onth ago, thus interrupting only for a few days the happy union of tnore than half a century. The tender devotion with which he cared for ber during her long illness, was only another manifestation of that kindness of heart, which protnpted him to many generous deeds. \Mr. Moss has enjoyed exceptionally good health, and up to within a few weeks was seen altnost daily about ol.lr streets, where his pres- ence was always welcome. He will be greatly missed in this comrnunity, where he has so long lived and enjoyed the 1 1 espect of all our people.', The staternent that Mr. Moss was \the oldest living graduate of any Atnerican university'' will need confirmation. Mr. Moss graduated when but nineteen years of age. Recent news- paper almanacs show that men are still alive who graduated at institutions several years previous to I 828. Every student at Yale is to be taxed $7 annu- ally for the support of the crew, track teatn, golf · and tennis associations. Ten sophornores l1ave been suspended from the University of Iowa for kidnapping the presi- dent of the class of 1904 at the titne of the h~esh­ man banquet. PHAQMACY COMMENCEMENT. Thirty-One Men Graduated at the Albany Department. Interesting cotn mencement exet·cises at Odd Fellows' hall and a banquet .at the Hotel 'Ten Eyck made the graduation of the da:ss of 1901, Albany CollegeofPharn1acyTuesdaynightoneof the tnostdelightiul and metnorable events in the career of the young students. Odd Fellows' hall contained a brilliant gathering, including sisters and other lady friends of the students who likewise joined in the social function which followed at the Ten Eyck. FoUowing the prayer by Rev. J. Walter Syl- vester came the a 'idress of welcome by Dr. Willis G. Tucker. Dr. Tucker spoke in his characteristic happy tnanner and was received with hearty applause. The president of Union University confet-red the degrees. The address to the graduates was delivered by Rev. J. Walter Sylvester. It was an eloquent and itn- pressive discourse, placing before the young pharn1acists the significance of their st1ccess and of the fi1:n1 foundation achieved fot· the fulfilling of responsibilities which confronted tl1em in the business world. At the conclusion of his address the students showed their appreciation by applause. George L. Southworth's valedictory was one of the features of the progratn. He thanked the faculty on behalf of the class for their conscientious training and bade farewell to those who fonned the happy associations of his college days. Dr. Alfred B. Huested then awarded the prizes to the students receiving highest percent- ages in the subjects mentioned. Conspicuous among the winners was Miss Catherine Ross of Hoosick Falls, the only lady member of the class. The prize winners are: For best senior in all branches, $20 in gold, Earl J.

Since last week developments have taken place which tnake the situation of the Carnegie library in the college pasture rather in1probable. Considerable opposition to building the library upon Union street has arisen in several quarters. Sotne people claim that Union street is not a central location, while others say that the library should be built in Crescent Park, the only green spot that Schenectady now owns. The matter will probably be formally acted upon in the near future.

8 THE C·ONCORDIENSIS. STAT'E SCHOOL OF ELECTR.ICAL SCIENCE. \Ogdensburg Journal,\ In a Strong • Editorial, Favors Its Establishment. A bill has been introduced in the State Legis- lature providing for the establishment of a labor- atory of electrical engineering in connection · with Union college in the city of Schenectady. · The bill carries an appropriation of $15o,ooo • for the erection and equipment of the laboratory and $25 ,ooo .a year for its tnai ntenance. In consideration of this assistance from the State, • the state is to have the title to the land and twenty-five four-year free scholarships in elec- ' trical engineering in the college. The cry of paternalistn already raised against the passage of this hill is hardly consistent with . the past action of the State in educational matters. There is abundant precedent for such action . found in our general educational policy ; the State normal schools, the Departtnentof Regents, the State 1\'raveling Libraries all owe their ·existence to this form of paternalistn. That these are distinctly State institutions is no refu- tation of the argutnent. Cornell university received substantial State aid at the time of its establishment. Alonzo B. Cornell, then Gov- ernor of New York, secured the assignment of valuable lands, cotning to the State from the National government. This property becan1e part of the endowtnent of that institution, which in change for the benefaction besto\ved, has ever since granted a free scholarship to every Assem- bly district in the State. It would be impossible to estitnate the value to t~1e body politic of these scholarships. It has furnished a means by which hundreds of intelligent young tnen, ham- pered by lack of necessary funds, have been able to gratify a cotntnendable an1bition for col- legiate education. Other than this the State has established and maintains at Cornell the State School of Forestry, a department of instruction which has been developed in this country only in recent years, and which already promises to become of inestimable economic value. No complaint has been tnade regarding this particular example of paternalism. Every- body recognizes its value and endorses the action of the State in the n1oney therein expend- ed. The proposition of Union college con1es before the people in much the sam·e light as did the establishment of the State School of Fores- try. It may not present so many broad argu .. 1nents in its favor frotn the standpoint of purely State econotnic, but it will appeal to the people as does every proposition which brings educa- tional facilities within easy acqui1·en1ent by the general public. The establishment of a State School of Electric Science is a proposition unique in itself. By so doing the State would add in1measu1·ably to its prestige as an educa- tional center. The school would becotne the acknowledged head of information and develop- ment in this field of scientific research. T'here i~ no department of education ot· field of investi- gation which prornises tnore lucrative etnploy- ment than that of electrical engineering. The unusual and rapid developrnent of the Rcience in recent years with its applications to co1nn1ercial activities has cre':lted a demand for men of high scientific education. For the developtuent and care of a State school of electrical engineering no better instru- ment could be found than ,Union college. It is one of the oldest institutions of the country and has vigorous educational life. Its location in Schenectady is especially well adapted for such a school. In that city is the General Electric con1 pany, the largest establishment of its kind in the world. Its tnachine shops and other build- ings cover nearly forty acres of ground and it e1nploys nearly six thousand persons in various capacities. Already Schenectady has becotne the center of electrical thought and develop- . n1ent and Union college should tnost properly becotne the custodian ar;td trustee of a State School of Electrical Engineering. Iowa University is represented in the State oratorical contest this year by a negro.

THE OONOORDIENSIS. 9 DAQTMOUTH M. C., 18; UNION, 8. Fast New Hampshire Five Takes the Garnet Into Camp. Union men had their first opportunity of wi:t- . nessing the basketball five play on Saturday night, when. the Darhnouth Medical CoHege tean1 V\rere the victors in a fast gatne. 'I':11e Dartmouth n1en, rnanaged by John W. H. Pol- lard, are nutking an extensive trip of two weeks' duration. They have vvon a nutnber of victori~es over fast tean1s. The evening before they played in Schenectady they were defeated by a margin of three points b\' R. P. I., which has turned out the fastest college five in New York state. Union's work, while not retnarkably strong, was a revelation to every student on the Anuory bleachers. It had been cotnmonly supposed that but one or two of the tnen were fast players. 'I' he contrat·y proved true. Each ntan played a snappy garne and used head-work throughout the contest. Tecun-play was always in evidence. Dartmouth showed the greater strength and endurance. rrhough her lnen did not pass tlle ball with greater precision except in the latter part of the second half, they were generally superior in blocking thro\i\ 7 S. The gatne started off at a rapid pace. Union was n1ore alert, and two baskets were quickly scored. Dartmouth soon overcame the disad- vantage and the half ended 7 to 5 in her fayor. The Union tnen tired sotnewhat in the second half and the n1en fro1n Hanover succeeded in · adding r I points to Union's 3· Both fives dis- played brilliant tean1-work in this half. At one tin1e Union bad six successive throws and at another, Darhnouth had seven. Union's only field basket in this half was tnade on a throw from the side-line by Anderson.

Examinations and lack of news are the reasons. THE college welcomes Dr. Wright to the hill after his long absence. The professor has fully recovered his health. May he retain it for many years to come. THE electrical school bill will receive several hearings before the Legislative committee in the near future. Men of prominence and influence will speak for the bill. STUDENTs who consistently bolt the college meeting Monday mornings have no reason to claim that they are showing the sHghtest college .spirit. Every one of them would strenuosly object if the faculty should take a way this important student privilege. The place for every man on Monday morning between quarter past eight and nfine o'clock is in his seat in the chapel. $325 out of the $600 deeded for paying the expen- ses of the baseball nine during the coming season has been subscribed. $275 more is needed. Every student who has not subscribed should do so at once. College spirit demands it. Money is needed to pay the initial expenses of the team. There is no time like the present for paying up. Support the nine! THERE are strong reasons why all track men in college should immediately respond to the call for candidates which Captain Weed has made. Exclusive of the annual State League meet, athletic gatnes are to be held with both New York University and Amherst. Preliminary training in the gyn1nasium and cross country work should be entered into at once. Union's failure in track athletics during the past few years has been largely due to lack of enthusi- asm at this season. MUSICAL ASSOCIATION PLANS. A concert will be given by the musical clubs in Red Men's hall, Scotia, next Friday evening, March 22. Manager Brown is perfecting plans for the annual spring trip down the Hudson, which this year will include Ap1·il 24-27. The first stop will be at Catskill on Wednesday evening, April 24. The stops for Thursday and Friday evenings have not been decided upon. New York will be rea.ched Saturday and the annual concert will be given that evening. New York alumni are promised a better exhibition than ever before. !\ ~' ~~ I l i ' ' . . I·,,

J\ ' ' ' · .. ! THE Q:QNCORDIENSIS .. 11 A STATiE ELECTRICAL COUQSE. THE ELBCTR:I·CAL SCHOOL BILL. \Hudson Qepublican'' Suggests the Number of Scholarships be Increased. That · ''Watertown. Times''' Thinks It a Very Practical Measure. We point with pride to our public school sys- : tern and we have a right to. Massachusetts, . long the exatnple in State education, is being • rapidly overhauled. A fe\¥ years more of the same ratio of gain and the Err1phe State will be · far in the front. A bill recently introduced in the State Senate : is another step, this titne in higher education. It provides for the establishment of an Electrical · engineering laboratory at Union College, by the ' appropriation of $15o,ooo tor the purchase of land and erection of buildings, and for an annual expenditure of $25 ,ooo for n1aintenance.. In , return the state is to own the land and be given twenty-four annual scholarshtps, good for a four year course. Union College is chosen because the General Electric con1pany has its huge plant in Schenec- tady. No better advantages could be offered anywhere than these n1agnificent works will give. There seems to be no serious objection to tl1e schen1.e, except on the old ground of pater- nalisnl which is always raised aginast any bill giving governn1ental-general or specific-sup- port. If the hill does pass a m.agnificent course will be opened, but why not atnend the scholar- ship provision and tnake it one for each county? If this is done, we believe it will sooner become a law. Such an atnendment would enlist each Assen1hlyman rnore earnestly in its support. Each county will have to pay a pro rata share of the expense and by the change we have sug- gested, each county would then have more than a general interest in the work:. Columbia today has four of her sons at Cornell on State scholar- s11ips. By a competitive exan1ination systetn, such as has been adopted in the distribution of the C()rnell scholarships, the best man would go. The Cornell baseball team has nearly thirty games scheduled for the cotning season. What seen1s to he a v,ery practical m·easure in the educational line is before the State Senate, involving a proposition to appropriate $1 so,ooo to erect and equip a laboratory of electrical engineering and pay $25,ooo a year of state money toward its tn:aintenance, in connection with Union college at Schenectady. There, if anywhere, is the place for such an institution, assuming that the state's educational policy is to continue in favor of technical education. Schenectady is the bo,tne of the General Electric company, where an army of skilled n1echanics and electricians are working out the ideas con- ceived in the wonderful brain of Thomas Edison. Union college is one of the old sub- stantial educational institutions of the state, capable of hearing the responsiblity of the charge of such an institution and with a faculty and management which may be trusted to make wise use of the advantages offered. As it is no longer a deno111inational institution, under the control of a church, the proposition seen1s to involve no etnbarrasstnent in that respect. It would put Union college in the same relation to the state as Cornell University. Union college, in return for the state appropriation, is to give twenty-five four-year free scholarships in elec- trical engineering and the state is to hold the title to the land. QUA~TET CONCE~TS. The college quartet gave a concert at Gran- ville last week Wednesday evening. H. J. Mc- Clure assisted with banjo solos and monologue sketches. Tuesday evening of this week they sang at the banquet of the College of Pharn1acy at the Ten Eyck. Tonight, with the as~istance of H. J. McClure, they give a concert at the Memorial Baptist church in Albany. The quartet now c<>nsists of G. LeRoy Shelley, 1901 ; H. A. Barrett, 1901 ; A. H. Hinman, 1902; and C. E. Heath, 1904.

The \Daily Gazette\ prints the following: \ Over half a century ago Atnos K. Hadley, who died at Mount Vernon, March 5, was a student in Union college. lie was born in Waterford, Caledonia county, Vermont, in 18r2. He went to school there and also took a prepar- atory course at \Vitesboro. · He subseque~tly came to New York state and entered Hamilton college. After two years there he secured an honorable dismissal and joined the junior class of l.Tnion college at Schenectady. He went to Troy in. 1835 and cotntnenced the practice of law. l-Ie was a student in the office of Cush- n1an & Seyn1our anJ later a tuernber of the firm of BTitton & Hadley. In 1847 he was elected to the Legislature to represent Rensselaer county, and the next year, under a redistricting, was chosen to represent the city of Troy. In I 848 and I849 he was speaker of the Assen1bly. In I 853 he removed to New York and practised law until disabilities incidental to advanced age caused his retirernent. Wbile in Troy he lived on First street, vvhere the office of Kennedy & Wilbur now is. At one tin1e he was president of the Young Men's association, and was also one of the three original trustees of the Benja- min Marshall estate. He took the first degree in King Solotnon's Primitive lodge, F. and A. ~1., Nov. 8, I 847, and was knighted a metnber of A polio con11nandery Dec. zo, r852. He withdrevv fron1 the lodge April 10, 1856, and snbsequently frotn the con1 tnandery. He mar- ried Miss Hart of 1'roy and is survived by one daughter, Niiss Anna Hadley. \Mr. Hadley was a contemporary of Russell Sage and one of the few survivors of the Whig leaders in this state. It is believed that Mr. Sage is now the only living rnen1ber of that fatnous group of which Mr. Hadley, in his later 1 years, used to talk .about with great gusto. lie retnarked on one occasion that Russell Sage in those days was as great a leader as any of those of the present time. Mr. Hadley was :at Sara- toga in 1856 at the inception of the present Republican party. He styled it a strange gath- ering of the extren1ists of the vVhig party.

The Concordie11sis VoL~ XXIV. UNION ~coLLEGE, MARCH 28, 1901. No. 22. SCIENCE vs. F:QEE T:QADE. Q. A. Benedict's ~ebuttal of Dr. Jones' Answer to His Argument. Writer Points Out Many Reasons for a Policy of Protection. Edltor of the Concordlensis: Referring to the article of which I was the author, published in the American Economist ,of November 30, 1900, reproduced in the Con- cordiensis of December I3, and reviewed by Dr. Jones in the Concordiensis of Januat~y Io, last, it seems to me to be due to Dr. Jones, as well as to the other readers of the Concordiensis, that I make some explanation. The point of n1y argu- n1ent against free trade seems to have been missed in Dr. Jones' article ; for he seemed to regard me as declaring that my pretty checker- board illustration represented the earth as the free traders represent it; whereas tny position is that, in order for the claims of the free traders to be true, the earth tnust be capable of graphic illustration in the manner which I adopted. There is ~1 vast difference between the two pro- positions. The claim which all free traders contend for-and I respectfully include Dr. Jones among them-is that absolute and uni- versal free trade would enable all nations to buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest markets and thus supply all their needs on the most advantageous terms possible to human agency. This is the broad claim. It is a glittering gener- ality. My method of treating it was to reduce the earth to a concrete fact in the light of that effulgent claim. The trouble with free traders is that they have never stopped to think just what this tremendous claitn of theirs necessarily involves. They deal only with the vague and the vast. To attempt to apply their theories to the humble facts and observe the result is too vulgar a business for them to engage in. Now I insist that, ifthe above claim of free traders is true, then this illustration of the earth tnust truly represent it : In order to assist the reader who has not at hand the Concordiensis of Decetnber 13, last, I will repeat here the three propositions from the principles of which this surprising figure of the e~rth is constructed : ( r) Every country rnust excel all other coun- tries in cheapness of producing some things and be excelled by thetn in cheapness of producing other things. ( z) Each country's advantages must equal and exactly balance its disadvantages, so that its surplus products tnay always supply tneans to purchase abroad the things it is not allowed to produce under free trade. (3) Of the goods in the production of which free trade demonstrates its superiority, each conntry must always produce and be ready to exchange a surplus sufficient to supply the world outside. If free trade would enable all nations to supply all their needs on the most advantageous terms possible to human agency, then it must be that free trade would not throw great masses of art- isans out of work. For the greatest disaster which can come to any nation is for any con- siderable portion of its people to be wanting employment and so their daily bread. Nothing so increases crime and depresses the moral level

THE CONCORDIENSIS. of any people as poverty and idleness; as the fact that willing hands and heads are denied the opportunity to labor for the boon of daily susten- ance. Now if free trade would not throw peo- ple out of work, i.t: would be because every country would he found to excel every other country in cheapness of producing some things, and in its turn would be found to be excelled by every other country in cheapness of producing other things. This fact is expressed in the cut by a black squa1·e, indicating cheapness, and a white square indicating dearness in production, each black square being thus supposed to be firmly yoked with a white square ; and thus is expressed the fact that every country is so con- stituted that under free trade it would necessarily both give lucrative employtnent to its own peo- ple and contribute to the employrpent of aU the rest of the earth. But one thing tnore is yet necessary in order that the free trade claim should be true; and that is that each country should be found so endowed that its volume of employtnent and compensation, because of free trade, would at least be as large as the volume of idleness and wagelessness caused by turning over to other peoples the supplying of a large number of its wants. This is merely saying that after the free trade experiment had begun, it would be found that the number of jobs added to the laborer's list of engagetnents because of the increased etnployment of his country in doing things which it could do tnore cheaply than all the rest of the earth, was at least as great as the number of jobs transferred from his country to other countries. And to represent this condi·· tion of affairs, in addition to the color, indicat- ing cheapness or dearness, I propose these exactly complementary squares of black and white, each precisely the size of every other. This represents the equality of the benefits and evils arising under free trade and at least the fact that free trade would do no damage, if it be true that the earth is made up of these exactly complernentary areas of production. And this covers my second proposition in the Concordi- ensis of Decetnber 13th-the proposition which Dr. Jones so emphatically repudiates that \each country's advantages must equal and exactly balance its disadvantages, so that its surp1us products may always supply means to purchase abroad the things it is not allowed to produce under Free Trade\-which is tnerely saying in other language that the jobs gained by free trade mu~t exactly equal the jobs lost thereby. This strict equality between the advantages and dis- advantages resulting from free trade, and the exact balance arising therefrom, is necessary in. order that the other proposition should be true, without the tJ·uth of which the free trade claim would fail, viz., that of tbe goods in the produc- tion of which Free T'rade den1onstrates its superiority, each country must always produce and be ready to exchange a surplus to supply the world outside. Because if its disadvantages were greater than its advantages, the rest of the wodd woul:d be under no constraint thus to cater to it in the supply of the things which it did not produce ; and if its advantages exceeded its disadvantages, it would be under no con- straint to live up to the rule embodied in the proposition, and thus the nice balance between these com pletnentary areas of production 'vould be destroyed and the automatic control of the selfishness at the bottom of human nature, a. control which is indispensable to the successfttl working oi the free trade rule, would be lost, and the favored countries could operate cot·ners on goods which were essential to the life and prog-ress of less favored countries, who might thus be compelled to pay a price for such goods compared with which the highest price ever \wrung'' from a people by the \robber trusts\ would be cheap indeed. Free trade would corne high if this balance were broken. It was a little curious that Dr. Jones should have heartily indo1·sed my third proposition, viz., ''Of the goods in the production of which Free Tra.de demonstrates its superiority, each country must always produce and be ready to exchange a sur- plus to s?pply the world outside,;; at the same time he should have declared to be \altogether wrong\ my secunel proposition, viz., ''Each country's advantages must equal and exactly balance its disadvantages, so that its surplus prod·ucts tnay always supply means to purchase abroad the things it is not allowed to produce

The compensations upon which to construct the third, which he of the one point would be exhausted in neutral- accepts. He says I ma'le no use of the third izing the disadvantage of climate; while those proposition from the fact that I myself realized of the other would retain all their telling effect that it had nothing to do with my argument. because of its having no need to use tll'etn to To my tnind the bare statement of it was its own equalize a disadvantage in climate. It seems to argurnent. Jt is simply itnpossible, considering me that tny proposition is true and that climate the effect upon trade of wind and '\\\eather war is a fixed and unalterable quantity in cost at a and diplomacy, that the proposition could be given point. If this is true, then in order that true; and rny argument is that if either of the / the earth should be a free trade ea1·th and all of three propositions is untrue, then the claim of I the three propositions above alluded to be' true, free trade must necessarily fail. And to the a figure representing the earth be constructed mind of the practical man of business, each one with a straight meridian like a cylinder's and of these three propositions upon which, as upon not with a curved meridian like that of the globe. a tripod, the free trade claim must stand, is The perfectly straight meridian does not tell the absolutely fanciful and unworthy of a tnotnent's whole free trade story, but it con1es near enough serious consideration. To him, the bare state- for practical purposes and weU illustrates the tnent of the three propositions is the reductio aa utter irnpossibility of the truth of the proposition absu,rdum of the sonorous claim that with trade that absolute free trade would give each nation absolutely and universally free, every country all the good things of the earth at the lowest could supply aU its needs on the most advant- possible cost. ageous terms possible to human agency. As The real earth, the earth upon which sensible the late Senator Ingalls would have said, that protectionists stand is like this: claim is an \h·ridescent dream.\ So much for the three propositions and the reasons why the earth in order to be a free trade earth, would have to be divided up into an infi- nite number of complementary parts, fitly repre- sented by the completnentary black and white squares of the figure. Now for the question of clin1ate. Dr. Jones adtnits that my proposition is at least \relatively true,\ that the element of climate is a fixed and unalterable quantity in the cost of production at a given point. But if anybody has as yet dis- covered how to elin1inate clin1ate in any case as a fixed element in cost of production, I have yet to learn his illustrious name. Cotnpensa- tions for clhnate there may be; but they do not alter the footing of the sum. If con1pensations neutralize the effect of climate at a cer~ain point, and 1nake it as good for certain production as some other point with a milder clitnate, it n1ust be predicated of that tnilder climate that it has no compensations itself-no natural advantages in which it excels its rival-or we would still have the tnilder climate just as much ahead of It is round, like a ball, as we were taught in the prhnary class in geogra pl1y. Blackness representing cheapness, and the shading away towards the poles, increasing dearness of pro- , duction, the real proposition we have to deal with is well illustrated in the figure. The cost of subsistence is the cost of production and that varies with the average annual amount of heat dispensed by the sun. It is not necessary to debate the question long, whether subsistence should be cheaper where the fanner raises one crop a ) ear or where he raises as ,many as he can get time to care for in a land of perpetual sumn1er. Under a general free trade combat, the battle would be decided by the cost of sub-

The raw materials of our great industries are pretty i:mpartiaUy distributed ; and we are only a little country of something like three milllion square miles in area as against fifty millions or so out. side of our confines, nearly half of which lies in 20nes of naturally much cheaper subsistence t!J:tan our own, zones which are being rapidly nlied up by white people, with all their tirele~s an1bition,. wonderful machinery and startling ski:ll and ingenuity. Modern hygiene is tnaking th:e tropics comfortably habitable for the white ra.ces. Wet·e this not so, there are ·elevated plateaus in the tropics of sufficient area to locate aU the factories of the earth, where the climate is as salubrious as our own New England and where white people can labor tirelessly with aU th~eir native vim and dash, while but a short distance below are the real tropics where the n1.eans ofsubsistence flourish in prodigal profu- sion. Do we wish to enter upon a free trade C<>fltest with all the earth, uRder these circum- st2nces? Would it not be better to put up the p~rotection bars so high and make the market here so sure that all the accutnulating capital of the earth would pour in and contest the field with the great trusts about which there is so much nameless and aimless fear, than it would t(} tear down the wall and let these very trusts join hands with foreign trusts, dismiss their American laborers, close their shops, and merely do a commission business handling cheap for- eign goods? Our machinery and our skill, about which so tnuch empty and baseless boast- ing is done, will go anywhere on earth they .are sent in search of opportunity. Let us not be deceived by the foolish dreatn or free trade. It is fitly repres~nted by the checkerboard earth. RoswELL A. BENEDlCT, '83. Sanford A. Moeller, ex-1903, is now a mem. ber of 1904.

Stoller ~poke before the Labor Lyceum Sunday on ''The Tw-o Fundamental Laws of Life.\ Prof. StoBer sajd in pat·t : ''In this talk I shall use the term 'life, in the bt:oad sense meaning all kinds of life. The two funda- mental laws of life are these: J?irst the main- tainence of self and second the maintainence of the species. The first concern of the animal is maintainence of self. This is known under the general term of intuition. The other great law is that of maintainence of species. ''If we examine the stmplest organism we shall see how these functions are petformed in the simplest manner. We shaU take the 1 ittle microscopic animal called the amoeba. It is a shapeless bit of geliti!laceous n1atter. When it comes in contact with a hit of food it flows around it and thus forms its mouth and digestive cavity at any part of the body. This is the simplest fonn of digestion. As we go higher up in the animal kingdom we find an animal that is somewhat cup-shaped. The ritn or top of this cup-like sac is the moutl1 while the sac itself is an alimentary canal. Still higher is the worm. The alimentary canal is divided into distinct parts and runs the entire length of the body. Take again the bird, one can readily see that its digestive apparatus is more highly organized than that of the worrn. \What I wish to illustrate is this, that as animals become higher and m()re complex we see a special adaptation for the can·ying out of this nutritive function. ''The other function of life is readily seen to be valuable as the first. Commencing again with the amoeba we will see th:at it multiplies by simple division. A constriction appears on the body and the anterior part separates from the posterior part and two anim~ls are formed. ''If we go higher in the animal kingdom we see that in one animal a certain part is set a side for reproduction.. It is true that many of these

THE CONOORDIENSIS. animals are bi-sexual. This .also applies to the wonn. In the worm we see the pt·ocess of pair- ing. The satne is. the case of the bird, but the bird is not bi-sexual. 1\'be sexes are entirely distinct. Here we observe social life. \When we com:e to man we see that 1nan is made on just the sa1ne plan. In most instances of barbarians it seen1s that they are not much above animals. There is ao fan1ily Hfe. I am inclined to think that in civilized life there are men V\rho are not much a hove the plane of these savages. It appears to tne that if a tnan lives solely for himself his life is not tnuch higher pitched than that ofthe animals. \All men tnust earn their living in one way or another. No man, however t·ich, is exempt from work. It is his duty to mankind. We should not work for ourselves alone, and should take pride in doing useful work. Work is judged by quality not quantity.\ E~\RO~ IN CATALOGUE.

STATE AID TO EDUCATION. Prof. Hoffman Addresses the People,s F:orum on the N·ecessity of Technical Schools in N~ew York State. Prof. Hoffman was the speaker at the People's Forum Sunday afternoon. In the course of his 1·emarks on the subject of . \State Aid to Education,\ the professor etnphasized the modern conception of education, the respons- ihiHty of which lay not with the fatnily or the locality but with the state. The com- parativd y young states of the w,est had maintained thorough state systems of education front the very first. In the East state univers- ities had not become necessary fro1n the fact that institutions such as Harvard, supported by . private benefactions, had proven themselves equal to the occasion. The present crying need in the United States and particularly in New York State was the technical school. In the establishment and maintenance of technical schools Germany led the world. The industrial situation in this section of the country was such as demanded technical schools and such schools should be supported by the taxation of those best able to pay. New York had rna de great progress in the direction of right and just taxa- tion and the speaker believed that the clay would com.e when inheritance and similar taxes would be tbe only ones imposed. An electrical school in Schenectady supported by the state was called for by virtue of the industrial conditions and needs of the state. Y. M. C. A. PQESIDENTS.

As a result, Mr. Woolworth a&ked that the game be played in Sche- nectady next fall. The football manager of Wil- liams in turn asked that the game be again played on the Williams campus. No solution of the ques- tion could be reached, and therefore no game was scheduled. The game in the fall of '98 resulted 5-0 in Union's favor. Williams was victorious the next fall by a score of 12-5. In the past season, Williams again won by a score of 5-o. Union has every reason to University will be interesting to Union's men.

rf}l THE CONOORDIENSIS. 11 HEAQING ON ELECTRICAL BILL. , No Opposition to Measure Presented to the Senate Finance Committee. The Finance Committee of the Senate gave a hearing last Tuesday afternoon on the proposed act to establish a School of Electrical Engineer- ing in connection with Union College. Four men were present to speak for the measure. Those who appeared were: President Raymond, of Union; the. Hon. Simon W. Rosendale of Albany, President of the Board of Governors of the University and forrnerly Attorney-General of New York; the Hon~ Danforth E. Ains- worth, a trustee of the Law School and Deputy Superintendent ofPublic Instruction; and 'Cap- tain Edward P. White of Amsterdatn, one of the college trustees. No one was present to argue against it. THE PRESIDENT'S ARGUMENT. Dr. Rayn1ond was the first speaker and he • detailed at length the needs of such an institu- tion and the reasons why it should be established at Union College. He first called attention to the official relations existing between Union College and the state government. This is that the governor, lieutenant-governor, secretary of state, treasurer, comptroller and attorney- general are all, by virtue of their office, members of the board of trustees of the college. By reason of this relationship the college is entitled to this recognition and the propriety and constitutionality, as far as it discriminates against other institutions, is apparent. Dr. Raymond then spoke of the special reasons for locating the proposed electrical school in thii city rather than at Cornell or any other college. These are the exceptional advantages afforded for the study of the electrical science by the presence of the works of the General Electric company here. No one who has visited this city in recent years, or v\rho is at all familiar with the condi- tions that prevail here, can fail to appreciate this. Even a single visit to the shops of the General Electric company is considered of such importance that professors from distant technical schools bring students to Schenectady for one day each year. By a special arrangement the electrical engineering students of Union College are privileged to visit the shops each week, dur- ing their senior year, and are thus enabled to study in detail the various .applications and uses of electricity. .H.e said if there were not already an electrical engineering department at Union College it would seem advisable to establish one there on account of these exceptional advantages. Aside from the purposes of instruction such a school would be used to meet the three following definite and legitimate needs of the state : It will be an official standardizing laboratory for electt·ical measuring instruments. No such laboratory exists today anywhere in this country. Such tneasuring instruments 11a\'e only recently come into use, and the need of testing them by sotne uniform and accepted standard tn!..lst be appreciated ,by all consumers of electricity. It wi~l be an independent and official source of infot·mation upon all questions of electrical science involved in legislation. As the use of electricity becomes more general the need of leg- islation will increase. Property and life must be protected. The state should not be depen- dent upon the expert testimony of rival com- mercial interests. It will be used for investigation and experi- tnentation in connection with questions of direct moment to the state, such as the application of electricity to canal navigation. OTHER SPEECHES. The other speakers hriefl y touched tt pon the needs of such an institution as the bill provides for, and pointed out why Union College was the proper location for it. All earnestly advocated a favorable report on the measure and its pass- age by the legislature. Herbert L. Fuller, ex-1901, has returned to college and entered the class of 1902. Archibald A. Lee, 1903, has been forced to leave college and go to Colorado for his health.

The rules cot11mi1ttee of the National league has made five important changes in the baseball rules for this year w·hich are designed to prevent the pitcher's delaying a game. Already con- siderable oppos;iHon has been raised against some of the changes, parti:cularly against the third rule printed below. The new rules are : 'The catcher must remain cl·ose up to the bat, or not over ten feet back, the distance to be marked with a line. The first two balls fouled w Hl go as strikes unless caught out on fly. A pitched ball hitting a batsman will count as one ball. The t1mpire shall call a ball each Hme the pit- cher delays the gatne more than twenty seconds. Ifthe ball is thrown to any one but the cat- cher by the pitcher with the batsman up, unless in an attempt to retire a base t·unner, the utn-· pire shall call one ball. INTE~COLLEGIA.TE O~ATO~ICALS. The annual oratorical contest between Roch- ester, Syracuse and Union will in all probability be held on Monday evening, April 29th. Rochester has agreed to that date, while Syra- cuse is as yet to be finally heard frotn. The name of the Syracuse contestant has not yet been received by the comtnittee in charge. INTER-CLASS CQOSS COUNTQY QUN. Captain Weed of the track team is planning for a large intet·-class crosi country run for the we~k following the Easter vacation. Points are to count 'in a novel t-nanner. If, for instance, there are fifty entries in the race, the man finish- ing first will be given fifty points, the second man will be credited with forty-nine, etc. It is hoped that this contest will be the means of bringing out some capable men for the long- distance runs.

THE CONC·ORDIENSIS. 13 H ALBANY JOU~NAL, FAVO~S BlLL. ' Influential Qepublican Organ Speaks Favorably of the Establishment of an Electrical School. The ''Albany Evening Joul·nal,\ a paper · that is as accurate a prophet of state legislation . as any other newspaper in New York, says that • the Electrical School bill will be favorably . reported. Its publisher, WiHian1 Barnes, Jr., . . chairman of the Republican State Executive •. Committee, is an earnest supporter of the measure and is lending his aid to assist in its passage. The \Journal\ recently said : \Senator Brackett went befot~e the finance · con1mittee this afternoon and asked it to report . his bill, which provides for the establishment of . a state electrical school at Schenectady. There has been very little opposition to this bill, and it is expected that it will be reported. The friends of the bill point to the fact that there is an actual demand for the ~establishment of a school for the study of electrieai engineering and say that no other place in the world is as well fitied as Schenectady, which is the hotne of the world's greatest electrical industry. If the bill becomes a law a site for the proposed college will be given to the state.'' INTE~COLLEGIA. TE. Cornell and Syracuse are having considerable trouble over their athletic relations. Co1·nell doesn't like the \ spirit of animosity\ which was shown by Syracuse men in the football gan1e last fall, and is afraid that there is profes- sionalism in Syracuse athletics. ''The Syracuse University \ 7 eekly\ denies both accusations and claims that recent victories over Cornell in tencing, baseball and basketball, make her a \worthy rival.\ The reports that Greek wiU go ere long as an entrance requirement at Yale are substantially confirmed by the word of President Hadley at the dinner of the New York Alumni, where he stated that the change would probably be made as soon as the secondary schools were ready to furnish a really ,effective substitute.
