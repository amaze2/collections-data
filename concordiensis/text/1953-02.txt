We wish him all kinds of success in whatever his next undertaking may be and hope that he makes himself a place in tile cua~hing world. His record here as cuacll was good considering· the material he has i1ad in his years at L'nion. \Vhen height controls the game w; it does today, Pete had to lead with five men 1 only two or three ot whom were ovet· six feet tall. His recurd over the iirst l. wo years he was here was more than satistactor,\', and only late, when material has gotten scarce, haYe the lJasl~etlmll fortunes been rough. Our opponents ale generall.Y :-;chuols \vho have programs suppotting athletes, while Lnion does not. We re- member talking to Pete last spring after basketball \vas over and he 1·emarkeu that for this season we'd have no height, and no l'e.:;el·ve strength. There might have been some promising ua.llplayers who were interested, but when they realized that no 1 inancial us,istance would come their way for playing l.Jasketllall, their interest waned, and so also did the chances for tile team this year. We'd like to see Pete get a hold of some good material in h-is next job and then we can see the results. The Con- cordinsis speaks fo1· the enhre scl10ol, Pete, when we wish you all the luck in the world. -A.L.G. A New Course The school has finally seen fit to ease the problems of the freshmen Ly substituting a requirement called \Formal Thinking\ for the mathematics requirement. Math is not abolished by the ruling. but merely placed as one of the two courses that can sntist'y the course in Formal Thinking. The Concordien~is Ita:-; backed the numerous sugges- tions made on campus for tl'!e past few years that the math requirement IJe S('lappe<l, ur sun.elww relieved. As a result of the latest_ faculty meeting. these pleas have not fallen on cleaf ears, and tile college has acted wisely. Key course in the new 1equirement is the newly organized course in logic or SS 1 o. Professor Larrabee has .spent much time in setting up n course which would benefit ·the whole division more than it dues tt~day, and which car- ries more formal logic than has lleen the practice in the :past. Plan-s ful' the cuu1.sc t,;all ;ur uue-tltinl more formal logic with a proportionate amount of social studies ma- -terials taken out. Freshmen who choose not to pass the Formal Thinking requirement by taking either J\lath I or 2 in their freshman ;':em>, have the alternative of taking the revised logic course when they are sophomores. This l~aves the liberal arts sturlents virtually only one require- ment in the field of pure sCience during their four years at Union and that is the completion of a laboratory science by the termination of their fi1·st year in college. Psychology, -which can be elected to fulfill the college's technic&.! re- quirement of two laboratory science, does not generally pass as a pure science. The school has been hit recently with a wave of fresh- man deficienc;v in studies. Not a small pm't of this difficulty can be attributed to the :\futh course, as it has proved rather trying to some members of the college student body. By keeping a requirement, yet inserting a choice within that requirement, the colleg·e has performed a useful pur- pose. It is theii· intention not to make any easier the courses at Union, but to bring them in line with the needs of the hour. We think the new SS 10 should be the answei' to many of the PI'oblems that confront the freshmen today. Too bad the college doesn't offer the new lQgic course before next year's fresh become second year men. We think there would be a rush. -A.L.G. Mo,ving Horses,hoes By ])on Sl~nons Having started upon the. gun-lap of undergraduate ad~catjon, it is true that mo;,t of the collegiate· arguments of another day :seem, for me, to have lost the full fire of importance which they once as- sumed. The heated controversies over the college, its nature, and- present condition, its we:;Lknesses and their correction, which once consumed so much of our time seem to have dwindled until they are now the subjects ,for quiet, almost disinterested, discussion, New changes in the routine of college will no longer affect eit:her the majority of my friends, or my- self and this factor is omnipresent in any consideration of college life. Nonetheless the subject natur!).lly remains a popular one, and even if it is tinged with a rather pes· simistic cymcism, this must he ex- cused as the nght and pet·ogative of the blase, eighth term semor. Enough has been satd about the apathy of the undergraduate body to make us all heartily sick of the subject. It is a feature of the col· lege, in its present situation, and gradually it is coming to be recog- nized as such. We can entertalll hopes that the administratiOn 1s taking steps to combat this atmo- sphere and that 1s about all, But beyond this, there is another more basic problem which seem11 to exist This is the absence of a collective and. individual pride in the very fact of being a college student Union is a tine college. It is cer- tainly not the best college in America, but it is an extremely good one and here there are all the necessary requirements fOI' achieving ex c e 11 en t education. Where then is the pride in the uni- queness of 'his situation, which this should engender in the student'! In appearance, the student body at Unjon is motley, and its actions seem very ID'IJGh the sarrra. In actual truth there is little that WOUld differentiate a group. of Stl,l- dertts outside Bailey f.{all between classes from a g:t:oup waiting for the change of shifts at G.E. '11here s)l.ould, be. We are not factOJY hands; and we ,are not mill work• ers from the north woods. We are col'lege students, at a good col- lege, and· there .is a vast diffet:ence between the two. Personally I should like to see decent dress ; meaJ;ling, a coat! clean dress snort, and tie, required for attendance at classes and all other college functions. 1 would like to see this, not ·because it has any meaning in itself, but rather in hope that it would be the first step toward a recognition of the unique position that we l;l,re in. Perha,ps a change in appear• ance might go a short way toward a commensurate change in atti• tude, and that would be wholly desirable, At any rate, aJ;lything which could be done to enect a change in the direction of pride and a feeling of solidarity in the stu- dent body, would be valuable. The woeful effects of too httle educa- tion at·e entirely too evident in the United States today to be >ignored. In our position as persons who may some day be able to claim the distinction of being educated men, I think we show too little respect for the value of that position . .1:-'er- haps dress is toe picayune a mat- ter to make any sense in this re- spect; I really don't know. But 1 am sure that even as pride may be a very dangerous thing, its value to the student at Union College, at this time, cannot be underesti- mated. Letters to the Editor Writer Disagrees with President's :Statement Dear Dr. Davidson and Editor: My purpose in writing this letter is to let you know that I and many others on this campus do not agree with the statement which you made in chapel January 13. 'fhe statement to which L am referring is the one which you made con· cernmg the adoption of the present deferred rushing program. You said that the Interfraterr.ity Coun· cil adopted this program without being forced to do so by the ad- ministration. Well, if you don't call Mr. Bill Ketz's statement at the I.F.C. meeting last year force, I should think that one of us does not understand the meaning of the word force as it applies to this situation. I was present at that meeting because I was interested in -hearing the arguments for and against deferred rushing and I knew that the decision was to be made that night. As the discus- sion proceeded it appeared to me that the deferred rushing prog1·am did not have the hearty approval of most of the delegates. It was then that Mr. Ketz stated that the administration had instructed him to tell the I.F.C. that the only per- missable courses of acion would be a deferred rushing program or a ru:>hing program which would all take place during the first week of school in September. I contend that with this unreasonable choice before it the I.F.C. was forced to appi'Ove a deferred rushir.g pro- gram. I have also heard that the ad- ministration sent a news letter to tne sub-ueshmen stating that there would be a deferred rushing system in etfect ~hen they arrived at Union last September. 'l'hts news letter was sent before the deferred ruf!hing system was fir.- ally approved by the l.F.C. If thil> information is true it certainly in- dicates that the admimstration knew beforehand that the deferred rushing program would be ap- pl'oved by the LF.C. How would they have known unless they had an important part in making the decision about deferred rushing? It will be interesting to look back at this deferred rushing pro- gram after pledging in March and see just how much better than the old system it has proven to 'Qe. J-udging from the mid-term reports the scholastic standing of the class of 1956 was not improved by de- ferred rushing. I am sending a copy of this let- ter to the editor of the Concordi- ensis and I do think that it should be published. I feel that the stu- dents at Union should know that the admiinstration, in spite of what it claims, uses force to ,influence decisions in the student govern- ment organizations. This letter does not officially ex- press the sentiments of any group on the campus. It is my own opinion.

College EXclul,nge Student at St. Andrews, Herb Spira. Since this epistle was received before the Eisenhower Formosa decision, B1·~tish thought at the time of the writing of the letter might be ma- terially changed now. Dear Editor: I ju.st had a seizure of thinking and because they are so rare these days, I thought I should record it for prosperity-aren't I consider- ate? If you are hard-up for an editorial, you can (full permission from the author) paraphrasP it and run it under the title: I Say \What's going on ovah theah ?\ An exchange student can look at the American scene with the ad- vantages of distance and perspec· tive. .Although he understands the bacl$ground and machinery of American politics, he nevet· quite knows what is going on because he is divorced from the strong and shadowy currents of America's all important third force - \public opinion.\ The exchange students' climate of opinion is created by the British influences around him. For in- stance, the British Public Opinion Service picked Stevenson to win by about two to one. Making the debatable assumption that these polls were acurate, we are left with the Inescapable counclusion that on grasping Amet ican feeling or outlook, the British are foreigners. The isolated exchange student can be likewise misled. From this cor- ner of the world, however, it looks like a more dedicated, enlightened, and determined \public opinion\ is rising with the new presidential standard. It appears that President Eisen- hower has resurrected things like equility, unity, public service, In- ternationalism, and resolute action to the status of national policy. He has brought them out of the darkness and cobwebs of political compromise ahd skeptical heckling and personal self interest. He phrased them in terms that at least FERRo•s RESTAURANT Good Food & Beverages PHONE 6-9554 FREE PARKING * 1115 BARREn STREET understand. .And now it looks as if they can stand the light of day. Lt is one think to talke the ele- ments of this policy. We have all done that for a lung Umu, ..::ven' the cynics who substitute sarcasm for curiosity. Eisenhower's words and actions can leave little doubt about his being guided by and working actively for unity, liberty, and justice. We fervently hope that United States \public opinion\ is with him.· We hope that the day of the cynic in the Conp·es and in the frater- nity house in waning fast. In the past. the stupid have been cock- sut·e while the enlightened people have been full of doubt. It is about time that the proc<'ss started being reversed. It seems that Dwig-ht Eisenhower typifies the combination of practical political action and the cherished American ideals that we know are the best in human nature and in the his- tot·y of man. These ideals have been challenged in every age by bigoted rulrrs and igrorant sub- jects and just plain selfish people. Eisenhower has phrased the answer to America's grPatest chal- lenge aptly and eloquently: \The Future Belongti to the Free.'' To this, I add \Fre('dom belongs to the Educated.'' To make the enlightened decisions that lead \public opinion\ you need facts. But to sort and apply facts toward a rc•solute conduct of American <intra, pan-etc.) affairs you need to know theories. Its strictly up to you over there. Is \public opinion\ swinging be- hind Eisenhower's policy? Is Union College succeeding in mak- ing \opinion\ more enlightened? The world is waiting for an answer. I say, chaps, what is go- Ing on over there. Cherio, Herbert Spira, '54 Ed. Now: This E'lpistle was writ- teon before Eisenhower's Formosa decision, which was weighed with some doubt through the British Empire. ~1111111111111111111111 lUll 1111111111111111111111.

The topic of graduation ::;peaket has been mentioned once bet'o1·e in the Concordiensis by columnist Eliot Loshak who recommended Adlai E. Stevenson. With all due respect to the erstwhile Illinois stateman and our parakeet loving columnist, \\'e feel that we have a candidate who would more adequately fill the demands of the situ- ation. For four years we Seniot·s have been aiming toward that day in June when it becomes known to God and man -that we have completed the pleasures and pains of under- graduate life. As far as we are concerned nothing could symbolize this majo1· event in nur livPs more adequately than an imprc;:.::sive graduation ceremony. We earnestly appeal to the Administration to weigh carefully the nom- inees fo:r the po~t and appreciate the necessit\· of an ap- propriate speaker. • We consider the following attributes essential fo1· an effecth·e orator and successful speech. This person must have the understanding am! sympathy of the modern gen- eration. This person must come forth in ceremonial mdi- ance v;ith a dramatic speech well calculated to arouse our consideration. The speaker must !mow our bl:lsic needs, must shmv an understanding· of ou1· basic problems, and by the speaker's mere presence indicate the answers to these problems i.e., show us what we may lool< fol' in life. The wot·ds of thi::; speakel' must be filled with promise -promise of things yet to come. The voice of this person must be co1~pelling- and daring, offering- full weight behind the speakers bold challenges. The delivery of the speaker must be of such a nature to keep oul' minds on the platform structure before us where all the action is taking place. The speech it!'elf must ht> in:;;pimtional in that it will cause the graduates to furthee their ambitions. The speaker must be so well ]mown that our g'l'1!rtuation will receive n~tion-wide publicity-every angle getting full coverage. Fmally, the speaker mu~t enhance the whole graduation ~cene-;-be it indo?rs or out. It must be a seen~ in keep- mg w1th the architecture of l'nion, the traditions of Union and the spil'it of our distinguished alumni-like our Foun~ der's day celebrant.

Class Spirit Congratulations to the Class of '56 for the great show of interest in their class elections this week. This interest in something other than fraternity activities has been sorely lacking at Union for several years and must be re- vived if we are not to degenerate into eighteen separate institutions. It would not hurt if some of the spirit shown by the neophyte class were to rub off on their upperclass colleagues. A class spirit that was impossible before the institu- tion of deferred rushing was shown by the 70 percent of the Freshman class who turned out to vote, and by the numerous candidates who in their campaigns showed an ambition and originality unheard of in previous years. Perhaps the candy bars, posters, and baby harmonicas which prevailed during the campaign appeared juvenile and high-schoolish to some, but to us it demonstrated that school and class spirit is still a possibility at Union despite the barriers offered by outside interests. Upperclassmen, taken a lesson from the Class of '56 I Look around you at the faltering activities and the poorly attended school functions and devote some small amount of time to bolstering them. If we do this we may once again be proud to wear the name-Union men. ~P. T. A. Letters to the Editor An Open Letter to the Class of 1956, II In this letter I \\ant to continue my discussion of son.e points \\hich I hope freshmen ·v. ill give caretul thought to Vlhen constder- mg joining a fraternity. l preface I 1\ ant to clarify one point on wh1ch some men at Union nave nnsundet·stood mtJ, l fear. l an1 not writmg these letters as an attacK on the fraternity system or a~ an attempt to dtsctedit any par· tlcular houses. Nor is. it my 1nten· twn to di:;suade freshmen froLl.t pledgmg. J:o'ar from that. Many of my most \\orthv.hile days have been spent in connectiOn with a fraternity. But there 1\ ere some things about fraternities which I had to learn from experience sim- ply because nobody had told me about them beforehand. And I hope that by callmg them to the attention of prospective pledges now, they may thinlt about them ahead of time, and perhaps do just so much more to improve and strengthen the houses v, hich they join. I hope the question has arisen at one tin;e or another in every fresh· man's mind, \What does fraternity 'brotherhood' mean?\ I'd like to pass along some of my observa- tions in the hope of being helpful. J:o'irst of all, freshmen, don't be too idealistic about \brotherhood be- cause some practical modifications of the ideal are necessary. I fear many fellows forget that joining a fraternity means not only ac- cepting and being aCGepted by a number of fellows you've made friends with, but also forcing your- self to get to know !j,!;Ld to accept as brothers some fellows you might never get to know if you didn't belong to the house. And in the case of the national fraternity, it means accepting, to a more or less limited extent, people all over the country as your brothers. With that acceptance goes a certain amount of loyalty toward and re- sponsibility for your brothers' ac- tions. Bear in mind that when you join a fraternity you will be enter- ing a close-knit little community, and for harmOI1Y to reign within it, you will have to adapt yourself to the oUter members so that you cart all get a,long together. Thus learning to ·be adaptable is good experience, naturally, and rather necessary on our crowded planet, but don't forget that you will have to make adjustments. And you v-iii have to be adaptable as a brother, too, ,for you can't black- ball everyone you don't a;bsolutely like if you expect to keep up your house's membership. Joining one of these little com- munities means a certain accept- ance of responsibility, too. There is a lot of jo!{ing about pledge tasks, but the physical work that pledges generally do is a small part of running a house. The fel- lows who have to make plans, bal- ance the budget, sweat out rush- ing, and so forth, are the brothers, especially the house officers, and probably half of you will hold a responsible position in your fra- ternity before you graduate. The opportunities for good prac- tical experience in living and for frienilship at·e great indeed, though certainly not unobtainable outside of fraternities. But these opportu- nities can be seriously impaired if you make a poor decision. Frater- nities are good, but not perfect. Keep your perspective when con- sidering them, and judge each house by the fellows, not the phys- ical plant-you have to live with the brothers. Perhaps the best practical advice I can give on this line is find out what classes the fellows you like most (and least) belong to. If they are seniors, you'll never live with them; if they're juniors, you'll live with them only a year. Actually, the class you should examine most keenly in any bouse is the sopho- mores; you'll rub elbows with them. quite a bit. One of the most important de- cisions you'll make while at col- lege is choosing a fraternity, if any. Don't be afraid to ask ques- tions; don't be afraid to wait awhile if you can't make up your mind. There is probably a place for you in· some fraternity at Union, but be sure you fit before you step into one. Dick Hoffman, '54 For Your Information FRIDAY, FEB. 20--No assembly.

That is, that war is no long.er to be l'e- garded as the . worst of all pos- sible alternatives. During his Presi- . dential campa,ign, in his tion and the Union sages, and ly in his of the se·ver1th Fleet from mosan waters, President Eisen- hower has shown a marked organi- zationa1 and executive ability~ But he has also shown that he intends to ge tougher with Russia; to \call the Communist bluff.\ In prac- tical terms, this seems to me to mean that we will now know much sooner whether we are to have World War III or not. During the campaign, President Eisenhower promised to .go to Korea for a first-hand view of the war while Governor Stevenson, no doubt motivated in the main by political considerations, said that there were no panaceas for the Korean war and that the root of the trouble lay not in Korea but rather in Moscow. Time, it seems to me, has borne out the Gover- nor's position. There are, indeed, no panaceas. The basic question, however, still remains-is the root of the problem .in Korea or in Moscow? The President's view of the war remains basically a mili- tary one. The ultimate objective of our Korean \police action\ is to stop the communists militarily. The test of war, to a general, is always victory. The test of war, it ·seems to me, should be the attainment of those political goa;ls for which the war is .baing fought. Moreover., war should. be the absolutely last means used to attain political goa:ls. In short, the root of; the problem does seem to lie in Mos- cow and no~ in Korea. Perhaps more important than President Eisenhower's views to· - wards war is the attitude of the American ·peopl'e toward war and' specifically, the attitude of ·US ,the youth who have ~o fight the wars. Too many of us think of war in terms of bands, parades, pretty girls \doing something\ for the boys, rneda.ls, and triumphant heroes. The movies have glam- ourized wars and warrio:vs. We Americans are naive in the ways of war for we have not had a war on our soil since 1865. The Euro- pean atitude toward war is simple and sensible-avoid it at all costs. If the French and the Gevmans, with their long history of animos\ ity for each other, can even think of uniting to a-void w:;tr, it becomes obvious ·how basically unimportant politica:l and even economic con- siderations become when compared with the bloody horror of war. Let us be realistic and see war as It is-a brutal and ugly process of killing and destroying. The root of our problems does not lie in Korea. It lies squarely in -Moscow and Washington. The Korean. war, even if militarily suc- cessful, will not stop communism nor will it diminish the possibility Gf all-out war. The only way to solve the Russo-American conflict is through peaceful discussion and arbitr~tion among the big powers or th'\lough the United Nations.

Street scene in Tehachapi after last Julr's earthquake. • • • EARTHQUAKE • • In the predawn of last July 21, the most severe California earthquake since 1906 struck the small town of Tehachapi. , Walls were collapsing, buildings were fold- ing. The town's telephone office shook to its foundation. But the night operator remained at her switchboard until it went dead. Main cables to the office were pulled to the ground when a nearby wall caved in. This was at 4:50 A.M. By 8:30A.M. telephones were set up on the edge of town for use by the Red Cross and other emergency workers. By late afternoon, the telephone switch- board was working. Tehachapi residents were able to contact friends and relatives concerned about their safety. By 9 P.M. two TV stations were sending live telecasts of the damage. Telephone men had established a radio-relay system in less than 12 hours. It was· a typical disaster- brutal and un- announced. But telephone men were prepared. They q:uickly restored communication when it was needed most. They demonstrated the resourcefulness and technical skill typical of telephone people.

Founder's Day We waited until after the Founder's Day exercises to comment on the choice of the cel2brant l>ecause we felt it was right. Founder's Day happened last Wednesday, in case any of the Concordiensis t~eaders didn't know or attend the college convocation. As President Davidson said, the purpose of Founder's Day exercises is to celebrate the founding of the college, which now incidentally is 158 reaTs old, and to tie it in with some informative talk about a man, a Union Alumnus, v•:ho shall be considered a Union Worthy, and thus have his paint- ing displayed on campus. For the Union Worthy tllis yem·, the college chose Fitzhugh Ludlow, of the class of 1856. Ludlow led an in- teresting career as a feee lance writet and as a traveler, which he did mainly for his health. His career was brought out unmistakeably well in talks by Professor Carl Niemeyer of the Union College English De:partinent and Professor Morris Bishop of the Cornell \Cniversity Department of Romance Literature, of which he is chairman. Their speeches were good, and ver;y informative, and that of the main speaker, Van Wyck Br(){)ks, was, if one could hear him, very interesting. The program was set up well and y·et there was quite a lot missing. We didn't originally think much of the choice of Ludlow for the Founder's Da;y celebrant. As Prof. Bishop said, he wrote tel'1'ible short sto1·ics, his poetry was second rate, and the only work of lasting valuE: that he had to his credit was his book about his \experiences while under the influence of Hasheesh. That book tvday though, even in Union College American Lit courses, scarcely, if at all, re- ceives notice. It is very rarely noted in any mention of pre-civil war American p1.1ose. Even the administration, apparently, found the choice somewhat hard to take. In the initial passages leading to the introduction of the topic and the speakers, remarks were made about Ludlow to the effect that here was a gem, al- though a bit tarnished, and that he, Ludlow, was only one of the two Union men, with John Howard Payne, to be con- sidered a man of letters. That seemed to be by way of say- ing that for want of someone better, Fitzhugh Ludlow was chosen to be honored at Founder's Day. His \Ode to Old Union\ is considered good stuff, as is his Hsaheesh tribune. But tll:at seems about all. Oh, he told Mark Twain once that he sh()uld not be content with merely being a journalist, but I daresay that that sentiment was echoed before, at least by a few people. However, as we said before, regardless of the choice, Foundr's Day ex- ercises were good, and the speakers very entertaining· and enlightening. Yet, we'd like to ask this question_ Did the celebrant for these exercises have to be in the field of letters where Union is admittedly weak, or could he have come from an- other field, where Union has many more than ten or a dozen, oT even one hundred men who have made themselves famous and their school, too. Of the rnany graduates in engineer- ing, or in the law, or in government service, ()Y in teaching, many Union men have risen to the absolute heights they can attain. While \ve've been at school, first William H. Seward, and then Seaman Knapp were honol'ed; these men had every right to be considered as Union worthies and the college convocations wre events of interest. But, to quote Prof. Bishop once again, . . . \I wish 1 could say Ludlow was a great man of letters, but I can't.\ Again, we'd like to emphasize the excellent program that was prepared for this Foilnder's Day, and with it t'he edifying speeches of Prof. Niemeyer, Prof. Bishop and Van Wyck Brooks, all of whom presented their material well. We do howevrer, believe that some thought can be given now to next year's Union alumnus who shall be honored on the 159th birthday of Union College. • By Alfred Ri:ngdon Back in high school I lmew a fellow named Elihu Linder. His relation to me was tenyous--some- where between acquaintance and friend. He was the kind of guy I never could get to know too well; one of the reasons being that his father made about ten times the money mine did. His father is the subject of this column. Leo Linder was at first glance the American success story. 'He was a distinguished corporation lawyer-his salary was well into five figures. He had a sumptuous horne, designed in the finest taste. It was decorated in \modern\ style with dramatic clashes throughout. His library covered one side of the living l'oom and was ample with books on every topic imaginable. The other side of the room was covered with a phonograph record collection the like of which I have rarely seen. It had about three hundred or so albums (the d\ays of the 78's). Things lilre the Picasso's covered the walls. Leo Linder's family was a close knit group-all endowed to a fairly high degree in art <they all painted), music <they all played alA instrument), and ex- traordinarily well versed in the letters. Most of their activities to- gether had as a chief result an en- joyment of each other and an im- provement of their position in so- ciety. Their house was all that I could hope for-their horne appar- ently a model one. Is this n-ot a picture of a model family? Not quite! Isn't this a complete picture of Leo Linder? No-there is one important piece missing. Leo Linder was and to my knowledge still is the head of the American Labor Party in Brooklyn. When I knew him he was kneP deep enhancing the cam- paign of Henry Wallace. He had just made a stirring address before the Lawyer's Guild in Chicago <now branded ultra-red by McCar- thyites. l Whenever and wherever he could Mr. Linder espoused the cause of socialism, the class strug- gle, an iminent revolution and the inevitable triumph of the exploited masses. There are those, who are great in number, who attack with gusto the idea of a Leo Linder as a J eklyy and Hyde character. They would castigate Linder as an inte- gral -part of the system in which he is pa.rasite by day, termite by night. Contrary to popular sentiment today the Linders are not anomal- ous to the American way of life. Disagreeing as I firmly do with many of Linder's ideas and ideals, he rtevertheles is commanding of more of my respect than most of today's self appointed, self styled guardians of our .American herit- age. Leo Linder desires a change in our system. If this change comes about Leo Linder will lose all of his material wealth and his prestiJ;e, and a! !that he can now give to his children. Yet, in every way Linder is LIVING <and that means bearing the responsibilities as WE'll as accepting the benefits of American life as we know it today. Linder works, pmvides a home, provides an education for his chi!• dren, is a sympathetic and under- standing man, will always listen to the other man, is socially con- scious, and unilke many of his fel- low citizens-he votes. Any change he does desire to make in our sys- tem he will do in no other way but by the means guaranteed by our Constitution. And, after all, is this not the prime function of demo- cracy-lawful progress. Deeper than the tides and times of 1953 is not Leo Linder the ex- ample of the\ well educated man? For here is a man that by any value system used as criterion in America today is not a failure sponging off of society, but on the contrary, he is an outstanding suc- cess. For Leo Linder has learned the golden rule of community liv- ing-that you must adjust to reality i.e. accept and accomplish all of societies' pre-requisites and live by societies' mores before you can rationally conceive and effec- tively execute changes in it. Out of this formula comes not the ill reputed, unaccepted, deviants such as John Brown, Wendell Phillips, Joe Hill, and Eugene Dennis but time honored liberal heroes lilre Jefferson, Lincoln, Darrow, Gomp- ers. and Brandeis.

.. . FRIDAY. F.EBRUA.RY 27, 1953 On. The Sidelin1es By Martin Hauser Union is a college of less than 1000 men, located in Schenectady, New York. It was founded in 1795 :py the Reverend· Dirk Romayn. It is one of the most richly endowed . small schools in the United States, with over •$11,000,000 neatly stowed·· here and there. It expects one man to coach three or perhaps four sports. Pete Nistad 1·eslgned as basket- ball coach a couple of weeks ago and immediately applications bt>- gan -to pour in for the job. At the present time · 39 have been re- ceived. However, the list is now . down to about ten possible men. · Ifs our guess we lost quite a few prospective hoop savants, when they learned that ~ addition to basketball,. iJV Football and Tennis were also taclte<l on ·to the job. Garnet Cagers Pictured above is this year's varsity basketball team. lntramurals Near Finale This past week saw many a heated contest up in Alumni Gym, as the Intramural basketball and V:<;JlleybaH _campaigns swung into their final two weeks. . In basketball, Kappa Nu retained their unbeaten streak when they ran to their fifth win over Phi Delta Theta, 52-44. This win lifted the K.N.'s into a tie with Delta Phi who aiso stand with a 5-0 record. The division title will be ' decided this coming Wednesday when one of the two teams must drop from t-he ranks of the un- beaten. By way of spectator inter- . est this game should .provide the viewers with a very fast and well played contest. Delta Upsilon with a 6-0 record · has now cinched the American loop title, while in the Eastern division Phi Delta Theta, at 5-1, will be playing Kappa Alpha, with a 4-0, in their -effort to regain the first .place that they had held or been tied for, most of the year. A good many of this year's games have found quite a few of Basketball now a days is re- garded as one of the two major college sports, the other ·being of course football.

Delta Phi, as in basketball, maintained its un- broken streak at 5-0 and will have only to extend its streak to seven to beat out Phi Delta Theta, who have been very hot as of late, with a 4-1 record. Delta Upsilon leads the American · volleyball league with a 5-0 mark and is trailed by Beta Theta Pi with four- wins and one loss. The Eastern league finds the closest race of all with three teams tide with a 4-1 mark.

LEADER, Lafayette College, 1954 Two answers to this question, given at a student information meeting held in July, 19.52, between G-E personnel and representative college students, are printed below, If you have a question you would like answered, or seek further information abou.l General Electric, mail your req,uest to College Editor, Dept. 221-6, General Electric Co., Schenectady, N.Y. G. C. HOUSTON, Manu· facturing Services Division ... While this is a rather broad question, I am sure it is one of real importance to any young man starting out in industry and looking forward to a position ohesponsibility in any of our successful in· · dustrial enterprises. E. S. WILLIS, Employee and Plant Community Rela- tions Services Division . . . A successful career with a company like General Elec- tric is built on !the same qualities that contribute to success in any endeavor. However, in G.E., there is additional opportunity to de- velop these qualities because of the wide variety of.t:rain· mg sources and openings which are available. Basic qualities needed for any successful career include an open ·mind, willingness to accept responsibility, per· sistence, adaptability, co-operativeness, and conunon sense intelligence. Others such as. physical well-being; ability of expression, and soimd inquisitiveness also go to make up a truly qualified individual, AT M. B. GRAUBART & SONS The mere asking of this question indicates that the in- dividual has a definite goal or objective. This is important since progress can be made only if we attempt to reach a well-defined objective-even th9ugh it may be modified to some e~tent in the light of later. experience. In G.E. we are looking for young men who have not only deter- mined their objective but who are ready to work for it- who accept responsibility and have ability to get things done-who work '1·ell with others--to be a part of the team. This calls for other qualities essential to long range success. We look for the enthusiastic individual, one not easily discouraged, and who can inspire the confidence of his co-workers. We desire individuals who show im- agination and good judgment-particularly the ability to look ahead and maintain perspective beyond the imme- diate situation. Finally, we cannot overlook the qualities of loyalty and dependability since these· are important in steering the individual through periods of discouragement whirh occur in every career. Most important is the fact that General Electric offers a wealth of opportunity to develop special capabilities and talents. The broad selection ·of training courses, in any chosen field, gives you a chance to sharpen your basic training and abilities. By decentralizing operations into about 70 different businesses, there is opportunity to see-in comprehendable' dimensions--the full opera· tion of the business. It means, too, that senior managers and young employees are more closely associated--:a real advantage for the young man on his way up.

Thus, there are equal chances for success for .those who concentrate in particular fields such as re· search, design, accounting, and planning. So set yoilr cap for a goal.
