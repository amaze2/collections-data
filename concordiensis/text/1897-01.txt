Briggs Lynes would in the future assist Dr. Ripton in the department of History and Economics. Mr. I_Jynes will be well received by the under- gl·aduates. His few weeks of work last term in tile department to which he has been appointed was most acceptable to the students, many of whom were in college during Mr. Lynes' senior year. In behalf of the student body THE CoN- CORDIENSIS extends to Mr. Lynes a welcome. The department of History and Econoinics is an im- portant one and will in the future, as it has in the past, be most ably conducted. WE PRESENT this number of THE CONCORDIEN- SIS in a somewhat altered form. We hope that the change will meet with the approval of all who :are interested. It is our intention to make THE CoNCORDIENSIS as good a publication as our finances will allow. Financial support is necessary to the success of a venture of this kind. We, there- fore, urge the payment of all subscriptions ~till ·due and will be glad to place the names of others on our list for the remaining months of the college year pro rata. The alumni and undergraduates could add materially to the interest of the paper if they would promptly submit any matter of collegiate interest which may come to their notice. THE CHltiSTM.A.S vacation is over and the long ·' winter term is about to comm.ence~. Doubtless a large number of students have already started Upon the new year with a determination to work ·. harder and accomplish more than they have done in the past.. Such resolutions, which, alwaya accompany the first day of January of each suc- ceeding year, are not without their value. They may or they may not be persev:ered in, but never- theless the world is better for their existence. THE CONCOltDIENSIS has a fellow :feeling with all of yon. We have also made our New Year's reso~ · Iutions and we trust that they may not be short- lived, but that they may cast a beneficient influ- ence over all with whom we come in contact. We most sincerely desire the good will of all of you. and in return wish you a profitable and happy New Year. · THE COLLEGE authorities have carried out the suggestions which were made last term by several members of the faculty and some of the students regarding an official bulletin board. The ready response which has been made t9 the suggestions which found expression in THE CONCORDIENSIS is indicative of the good \\\till of the college author- . ities and shows their willingness to grant all reasonable requests. It rests with the students now as to whether or not the new arrangement will be e:ffi.cient. When the coveted board, which is in course of con- struction, is placed in position, the students must recognize that it is for their benefit that it has been constructed and must refrain from covering it with student notices or from mutilating it in any way. BoSTON, Jan. 5. -Gen. Francis A. Walker president of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech~ nology, died this morning. His death was unex- pected. He had been in good health up to the time of retiring last evening. Just before mid- night he was stricken with apoplexy. Mrs. Walker was awakened by the General's bard breathing. She summoned several members of the family, attempts were made to restore him to consciousness, while a messenger was sent to sum- mon a physician, but they were all in vain. The General died before a physician arrived.~New York Sun. The followng extract is a record of the death of one of the ablest college presidents in this country. General Walker has been identified with educa- tional institutions during the grea.ter part of his life. .As a statistician he is without a peer in the United States. He has written many works on scientific and economical subjects. His work on Political Economy is used at the present time as a text book on that subject in this college.

THE CONOORDIENSIS. 7 · AT ';fHE alull,).ni meeting h~ld in Schenectady, J un~ 23, 1896,. 4-. S. Wright, '82, offered the follow- ing resol:ntion ; , Resolved, Thaat a committee of three be appointed by the Alumni Association of Union College w~ose duty it shall be to send out annually two bulletins; one in the fall, giving the transactions .of the pre- ceeding annual meeting and other matters of general interest to the alumni; one in the spring, informing the a.lumni of matters to be considered at the alumni meeting. A. S. Wright, '82, A. C . :Bennett, '87, and A. MacFarlane, '84, were appointed as such com- mittee. As a result of the foregoing resolution the first . number of the Union College Alunlni Associa- tion. lias· recently made its appearance. It is a pamphlet of about fifty pages and con- tains an accurate account of all the affairs of the .college under the following headings: Alumni Meeting, Commencement Exercises, College News, Alumni Notes and Necrology. The pamphlet has been well compiled and con- tain& much ma.terial which, in time to come, may be of historical value to the college. The publication of such a pamphlet, twice a year, supplies a much needed means of preserving inter- esting matter concerning the college and its alumni. Its publication should be carefully looked after each succeeding year and long before Union celebrates her second centennial anniversary she will have an interesting record of college events; that is, unless the succeeding numbers of the ''Bulletin\ follow the course which many college publications have taken in the past. ~olle~e ptl]letie ~ules. The constitution of the Intercollegiate Asso· ciation will this year undergo many changes, which, it is thought, will tend to improve their annual field and track meeting. Among the changes which will be submitted to the executive committee, the following are the most im- portant: It is made mandatory on the secretary of each college association to send evidence of at least one athletic meeting during the college year. Heretofore the association has assutned con- trol of college bicycling, although it was not stated in the constitution. This will also be provided for in the new constitution. Members of the executive committee must be undergraduates at the time of their election. The vice-president, who formerly succeeded the president in case of a vacancy, will not have that power under the new rule. A new presi- dent must be selected, and in the place of the former vice-president, two honorary vice-presi· dents are provided for. The secretary will have no vote under the new provision. The rules governing the field and track tneet- ing have been entirely changed. The annual meeting is to be held on the last Saturday in May of each year. The preliminary heats of the dashes, hurdle races, in fact all runs except the mile, when in the opinion ofthe referee the number of entries shall render it necessary, shall be run on the previous Friday afternoon. This will leave for Saturday, only the semi-finals and finals of the dashes and hurdle races and the finals in the quarter-mile and half-mile runs. The field events shall be treated in the same manner, in each of which not tnore than five . men will be left to compete on the Saturdays. The first three of the two afternoon contests shall be allowed three additional trials. The bicycle races, although considered as a part of the annual meeting, will be held on the second Saturday in June. Article 14, of the new constitution, gives the executive comtnittee power to suspend when it is not necessary to expel, any college not con- forming to the rules. Hereafter the referee shall be a non-college man, but he may select the other officials from college men. The selection of a manager of the annual ga1nes from among college graduates is a very itnportant change. This manager will have control of the meetings but will be subject to the will of the executive committee. His work has fonnerly been done by the secretary. Sorne suggestions governing the bicycle races have been tnade, the principal one of which is for a time limit on the races. A new constitution has been drawn up embody- ing these changes and some minor ones. This will be submitted to the executive committee at their next meeting which takes place on J anu- ary 8.

Mr. Lehman expects to return and take charge of the crew again next March. Mr. Lehman is an able writer as well as athletic enthusiast. He acts as correspondent for several English papers. His report of the Harvard-Pennsylvania foot ball game, which appeared in the London .Daily News, was excellent anfl shows an Englishman's appreciation of An1erican foot ball. During the year 1895-6 ninety-one profeisors and instructors at Cornell printed 495 book and magazine articles. According to the latest report of United States Commissioner of Education Harris, there are in this country 48 I colleges and universities. These enjoyed during the past year a total income of $r6,783,638, employed 8,459 instructors, and enrolled 63,402 undergraduates and 4,273 graduate students. President Raymond, at the close of chapel services, Tuesday morning, announced several changes 1nade in the curriculum of the under classes. The chief tendency of the changes is, to give more time for the natural science studies in the various scientific courses. Biology has been tnoved forward to the Freshman year, calculus has been similarly treated and hereafter French will be required in the first-term Fresh- man work of classical students. pmus~meQtS at tl]~ VaQ Curler.

.. ·~· i • The Concordicnsis VoL. XX. UNION< COLLEGE, JANUARY 13, 1897. No. 14:. f5rao~ flt~leties. A picture of the track team was t~ken last Saturday. It was intended to cornprtse t.ho~~ men who would have been on last Spnng s team. Consequently it was som<ew hat restricted in numbers as quite a few have left college who would have otherwise been counted in. This picture is intended for this year's Garnet and another will be taken in Spring comprising all men who make this year's team. Those who were in last Saturday's picture are as follows: Captain O'Neill, '97 ; Price, '99 ; Hinman, '99 ; MacMillan, '98; Crothers, '98; Fisher, 98; Hartnagle, '98; Sylvester, '99; W. Yates, '98; Cotton, '97 ; French, 99 ; Vrooman, '98 ; Wright, '99; Deyoe, 98 ; Hoxie, '98 ; Hegeman, '99; Hild, '98. There are undoubtedly others in college who will be added to this list before the year is over, and it is hoped the number will be greatly in- creased. If the fall meet had been counted the number would have been increased by quite a few and we are glad to notice that the freshman class would have had its share. Too much en- couragement cannot be given to those who are inclined towards track athletics. By a proper course of training they can not only benefit themselves physically but have the opportunity to do something for the college. It is with great hopes that we look forward to this year's meet. No definite schedule has as yet been arranged. The reason is that the for- mation of the new league has not been com- pleted. The regular mid-winter meet will be held sometime in March. For two consecutive years in-door meets have been held whh the Cooperstown Athletic Club. Two years ago we were beaten only with diffi- culty by them. I.Jast year they were but five points ahead of us and this winter if a meet can be arranged, we expect to win. We hope to send a strong team to the intercol- legiates this Spring ; no doubt Manager Herring will have several other important meets sched- uled for us before long. The team in its present condition as a. whole is very strong. Every event is well sustained. In the dashes, O'Neill, Price, Hinman, French, Gage and F. R. Davis are the most promising men. O'Neill and Hinman will vie with each other in the quarter-mile run. Nothing especially strong has as yet devel- oped for the half-mile but it is hoped, that French, who has signified his intention of train- ing for that event, will turn out as good a man for that as he has already in the dashes and quarter-mile. In the mile, Wright, Hartnagle and Multer are at present doing the best work. The hurdle races will be well taken care of by Crothers, Pearse, Vroman and Sylvester. Walbridge is expected to develope into an excellent man for the bicycle races. He and Hild can be relied upon to do good work for the college at their first opportunity. In the shot put and hammer throw, Mac- Millan and C. Vrooman are improving rapidly and records will undoubtedly be much improved by next Spring. Fisher, Deyoe, Sylvester and Miller will con.;. tend in the pole vault and Schofield, W. Yates, Deyoe, Fisher and Davis in the high jump. Cotton, Hegeman and Guttman are three good men for the mile walk. Schofield, Jones and Davis have shown them- selves to be excellent broad jumpers. The fact that a large number ~f men have · signified their intention to try for the te~m · should sthnulate the interest rather than dis- courage anyone from trying for a position. Freshmen will have the same chances for making the team as the members of any other class. Captain O'Neill will ?e only too g~ad to help along any and all beg1nners and gtve them the benefit of his experience. A trainer will undoubtedly be hired in the Spring. <

4 THE CONCORDIENSIS. fl Sy1Jopsis of preslde:Q't f1ayrno~Qd's ftd-· dress 8uqday .flfterQOOQ. A peculiarly appropriate and forcible dis- course was preached in the chapel last Sunday afternoon by President Raymond, the subJect of which was, ''Essential El·ements in a Success- ful College Association., A large body of students and m·em hers of the faculty was pres- ent. In presenting the case of the college Y. M. C. A., Dr. Raymond said two questions at once presented themselves. First, What is a suc- cessful college association ; and second, Are the elen1ents essential to such an association differ- ent from the elen1ents essential to other success- ful associations. The speaker expressed it as his conviction that the success of any college association is measured by the extent to which it makes Christian discipline desirable by every student who is seeking to make the most of himself. In other words the successful col- lege association makes Cbristianity a dominat- ing influence in the institution. In regard to the second question the speaker said that only in degree were the elements the same. College men formed a class by them- selves and were indeed little understood by the outside world, and appreciated less. In con- nection with this he cited an interview with General Miles; in which the great Indian fighter tried to prove to him that the college yell and the war-whoop of the plains were an expression of the same wild nature. A primary condition of Christian work in colleges is sincerity. A man known to cheat in the class room talks into tpe air whenever he attempts to persuade others to believe in Christ. Nothing would do more for the cause of Christi- a-nity a.mong students than the suppression of such men. Moral distinctions must be clear and absolute; otherwise they have no inti uence. Much of Christianity's weakness today lies in calling things wrong which are not wrong in them- selves. Fal$e distinctions never foster righteous- ness. Evil i$ all in the heart of man and we . shall never make any advance in righteousness, until in our teaching we put it there, for not till then will we put virtue where it belongs. There must be more preaching of this truth . before there·will be more genuine righteousness ; that men must learn how to use this world rather than simply how to let it alone. This is the only Christianity that .is authorative, for it . is what Christ himself taught and practiced. He did not avoid men and for purposes of holiness, flee to the mountains. This has an intensely practical bearing upon · our college work. One of the essential ele- ments of successful association work is that the members identify themselves thoroughly with all college interests; showing how to enjoy and . use social life without degrading oneself or de- &troying studious habits ; how to engage in athletics without sacrificing character or scholar- ship; i1ow to share college enthusiasm .without being carried away with it into foolish and un- . worthy practices. One practical result of this kind of Christian work will be to increase popular respect for Christians and a greater willingness to listen to their words. Dr. Raymond spoke for a half hour and touched upon many subjects which were .ex- . tremely interesting and of vital importance to the student. Lack of space prevents a more ex- . tended account. l51]e flew l?~ermometer. The large thermometer which hangs to the left of the main entrance to Washburn Hall was given to the college by Gilbert K. Harroun. Its usefulness is manifested by the large numbe.r of students who inspect its readings daily, so as ·to detertnine whether it is policy for them to shiver in hopes of getting a bolt. Dr. George Alexander, '66, waa in Sche- nectady, Monday, January 1 I. He was in attendance upon, the semi\'centennial annivers~ary of Dr. Day's pastorate of the Baptist Ch'ut·ch.

The Sophomore soiree·committee held a tneet- ing at the Phi Gamma Delta house W erlnesday afternoon, Jan. 6, and decided to hold the annual soiree at the Van Curler. Opera House, Friday evening, Feb. 19, 1897. The floor at the Van Curler will be repaired and relaid and covered with new crash previous to the dance. The private boxes will be disposed of at auction and in order to accornodate the large number of parties who have signified their inten- tion of purchasing boxes, the cornmittee will have the two front rows of chairs in the ot·chestra circle ren1oved and the space divided into boxes by means of screens. Complete arrangements for the tnusic have not yet been completed, but it will probably be furnished by Gioscia's full orchestra. Several parties frotn Albany, Troy and Sche- nectady have bid for the privilege of ftn·nishing refreshments a:nd the tnenus subtnitted are of an exceptionally high order. The contract will be awarded at the next tneeting of the cornmittee. The invitations are now being printed and will be tnailed as soon as possible. The Roiree will be '99's first appearance socially and they are putting forth evel'y effo1t to make it a success long to be rem em be red at Union. This will be the only lat~ge dance at Sche- nectady during the winter, and as it immediately precedes vVashington's birthday and Lent, it will be largely attended. 'l\'he comn1ittee consists of F. J.

THE college musical organizations are billed to give their Schenectady concert on Tuesday even- ing, J\ an. 19. Every student in college should attend. There is not the slightest reason for any student to remain away as the price of the tickets is within the means of all. The support of college affairs such as the one in question should be re- garded as one of the necessary expenses of a student. A profitable and enjoyable evening may be had by any one in attending this concert. The students belonging to the clubs have worked hard to accomplish what has already been done and the least their fellow student can do to show their appreciation is to go and hear them. A REPORT of President Raymond's address de- livered to the students last Sunday afternoon ap- pears elsewhere in this paper. This report calls attention to the series of short sermons by which the students have been favored in the past and to which it is hoped they may continue to listen in the future. Last Sunday the attendance was unusual. There were fifty-eight students present which is about double the usual number. No student ever attends these Sunday afternoon services and listens to the carefully prepared remarks of the president with indifference. He immediately becomes in- terested and his interest continues until the ser- mon is finished. His appreciation ,of the address which he may have been listening to is followed by regret that he had ever failed to atten.d in the past. The foregoing remarks are addressed to the students of this college, in furtherance of the work of the Y. M. C. A. and for the interests of tbe students then1selves ·who through thoughtlessness · rather than indifference have failed to appreciate the efforts which 1·epeatedly have been made to make these services of interest as well as profit. INSTEAD of building a ne'v residence at the- junction of Union Avenue with Union Street as was at first planned Dr. Potter has made arrange- ments with the college authorities to move into his former residence which is at present occupied by Professors Landreth and Hoffman. Instead of the original plan he will construct two houses which are to be occupied by the before mentioned professors. There is no doubt but that this new arrange- ment from the standpoint of accommodation is an improvement upon the original plan. \ How MUCH is there in it?\ The foregoing question was asked a few days ago by a student of this college who had heard that the editors -of THE PARTHENON desired some one to draw a black and white poster for purposes of advertising. We regret the necessity of having to state that there is '' nothing in it.\ We do not wish to criticise any person for desiring to make an hone.st dollar, but we do criticise the lack of collegiate spirit manifest in such a question. If the college p~blieations including THE GARNET, CONCORDI- ENSIS and PARTHENON were able to pay for such matter as the students furnish they would be veritable gold mines. A little experience however in the ~ctu~l business, foll<?wed by a little paying o_f de~c1enmes wot!ld convince these people that they hold an entirely erroneous idea regarding such matters. ''How much is there in it?\ The words, the sound, the very form of the sentence is so entirely opposed to a healthy collegiate sentiment that it is a wonder any student should have expressed it. The spirit which is Inanifest in this sentence is the same which fosters professionalism in athletes mutilates books in the library, subscribes to col~ leg~ affairs and then forgets to pay, it is the spirit which makes good tradesmen but indifferent scholars. ·

THE CONOORDIENSIS. THE tnerchants of Baltimore ha.ve subscribed $239,500 to Johns Hopkins University to tide the institution over the difficulties· of the present, which are largely due to the issue of its invest- ments in Baltimore and Ohio railroad stoek.-Ex. And in 101 years Schenectady has given to Union ·College $7,000. IT SEEMS to be necessary to again call attention to a flagrant violation of the lib1·ary rules. Some members of the Freshman class are the principal offenders. The library corridor and alcoves were constructed for library purposes only. Students who use the lib1·ary as a study hall are lacking in a just appreciation of the rights of others. It is absolutely impossible for any person to do any serious reading 'vhen there are eight or ten ·students walking noisily about the tables, talking to one another as though they considered this building as an annex to the gymnasium. Further- more, the chairs and tables are placed in the alcoves for the use of those who are using the books of that particular section. It is extremely annoying to find students in the English or Philo- sophical alcoves studying their 1nathematical text- book. They a1·e oecu pying the chairs as well as the roorn which belongs to others. The place for students to study text book lessons is their rooms or the chapel. Any place rather than the library. WE UNDERSTAND that there is some dissatis- .faction among the students who have been d1·illing for the various musical clubs over the prospect which is held out to them as members of these <>rganizations. It is the intention of the manage- ment to include as large a numbe:r of those who have been practicing as 'vould be practical in the .Schenectady, Albany and Troy concerts. The impression that the number is to be cut down to half as many when the clubs give a concert out .of town is erroneous. From twenty to twenty-five will be included in nearly eve1·y concert given out of town. There is certainly two sides to this question. Those who are dissatisfied say, the organization -should be the sante on all occasions, and that if the managen1ent cannot afford to take a large number on the out of town trips then the number in the Schenectady concert should be reduced .accordingly. They ad vance as reasons for this, the fact, that the drilling required of the students for the first concert is but little less than that re- quired for the whole. And also, that any aggre- gation of musicians after drilling for the purpose . of producing the best results with a certain num- ber, must necessarily fall short of that result when the number is. altered, particularly so if redu~ed. The management on the other hand knows best what he can afford. If he can talie only a limited numbe1· out of town and be certain of clearing expenses, then it would be folly for him to take more. Furthermore, it is not always the intention. to take along the same men. Some may be taken on one trip and some on another, and the only way to be able to judge who are the best men is to give a large concert such as the one given in Sche- nectady is to be. And last but n<>t least, the rnost important test of a man's ability is that whiich. comes when be is actually confronting an audienee. One who may have stood the test before may he:re fail. ~one~e Notes. AN ALL-AMERICAN FOOT BALL TEAM.

GIFT TO THE GEOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT OF LEHIGH. The department of geology in the University has just received a Qollection of triassic shales and saodstones of the Connecticut valley. These shales and sandstones have long been noted fol' their impressions and ripple marks, rainprints and the tracks made by the reptiles of tha. t period, which are from time to time found in quarrying the stones. The shales obtained by the University contain foot-prints varying from several inches in spread to but a portion of an inch in width and are atnong the most hnportant of the acquisitions t<> the museum for many years. These fossils are a gift to the University f~om the Philadelphia Lehigh club whose members generously con- tributed the money for their purchase. No college has a more enthusiastic and loyal body of alumni than Lehigh. The practical illustra- tion of this loyalty, shown by the Philadelphia club, is worthy of all praise and imitation.- Brown ancl Whlte .

In 1 867 Dr. Perkins engraved the names of his class in chemh;try on a pane of colored glass and had it placed in one of the laboratory windows. He has kept up the practice every year since until it has become an established custom. The present class will make the thirtieth consecutive one. This novel collection of autographs is highly valued by Dr. Perkins and has been the subject of many magazine articles. On the ev~ning of Jan. 6, '97, Rev. Edwin Waite Miller, A. M., a graduate of Union, was inaugurated as Hyde Professor of Ecclesiastical History and Church Policy of Auburn Theo- logical Seminary. Prof. Samuel B. Howe, of Schenectady, likewise a graduate of Union College, represented the Board of Commission- ers. The ceremonies took place in the chapel which was filled by faculty, commissioners, trustees, students and friends. Emeritus Prof. Samuel Miles Hopkins, D. D., delivered the charge to his successor, who was also a pupil of Dr. Hopkins. Last year, 1894-95, Mr. Miller acted as instructor in that department. He was elected professor last May.

The concert given in the Van Curler Opera House, Tuesday, by the college musical clu.bs was a decided success. Every .number on the programme was rendered with har.dly a flaw. The audience, while it was not .as large as it . should have been upon such an occasion,· was an appreciative one and applauded heartily. The curtain rose at abou~ 8 : 30 o'clock and hntnediately the Glee club filed in and took their place. They forn1ed a large semi-circle which neatly filled the front of the stage. The first selection, '' Union Eeside the Mo- hawk Vale,\ written by C. E. Franklin, '83, ; was well rendered. 'This was followed by a selection, entitled ''That Little Peach,'' ·which highly pleased the audience. As the ~lub £led off the stage they were loudly applauded. They responded with an encore. The second number,\ El Turia,\ by Granada, was rendered by the Mandolin club in such a manner as to call forth h~arty applause, in re- sponse to which an encore was rendered. The singing of Messrs. Greene, Hinman, MacMahon and Eames, who constituted the quartette, was thought by many to have been one of the main features of the evening's enter- tainment. . They responded to the generous applause which followed by singing H Tenting on the Old Camp Grounds.\ The Banjo club, always a favorite . among collegiate musical clubs, t·endered their · first selection, \Coat of Arms March,\ without a flaw, and received well merited applause. They also responded with an encore. . Mr. Cook created a great deal of laughter by his rendition of the character sketch \Casey in Court.\ The audience insisted that he should return which he did giving a pathetic reading which, in conclusion, .dt·opped from the sublime to the ridiculous. \Wah Sid\ (Chinese ~arch), by Lautz; was fairly well rendered by the Mandolin club. In this piece the Guitars sounded .somewhat louder than appeared necessary. The audience, how- ever, were · pleased· with the · selection and expressed their approval accordingly. · · \Three.Doughtie Men,\ which was sung in parts by · the Glee cl uh, was one of the best selections of the evening. \Popular Pot--Pourri,\ arranged by Mr. O'Neil, '97, was well rendered by the Glee and Banjo clubs. · It was in many respects the best number on the progtamtne. Hearty applause followed but they could not be induced to re- turn. . The \Ideal Serenade,\ was the tnost p1easing selection given by either Mandolin or Banjo club. . Mr. Heinz and the Glee club did excellent work in the number entitled\ Wot Cher.\ They had to come back and give part of it over again. \ Love and Beauty Waltzes,\ by the Banjo club was excellente '' The Hoarse Singers,\ was acted as well as sung and in a mannet: which fully merited the hearty applause which followed. ·Mr. Cook again appeared and gave a reading entitled ~'Jimmie Brown's Prompt Obedience.\ ~Ir. Cook has a fine enunciation, and an easy manner upon the stage. The Glee club sang the \Terrace Song\ with spirit. Mr. MacMahon in . the solo parts did well. The '' Drinking Song \ as well as the \Song to Old Union\ were rendered with true college spirit. Altogether the concert was one of the best that has ever been given in Schenectady by the college musical clubs. . On .January 22·' the. clubs._will give a concert a~ Canajoharie .. A ~arge. crowd· of students is expected to accompany the clubs on·this trip.

THE CONOORDIENSIS. 5 The fencing club has been reorganized and expects to purchase an entire new equipment of foils, masks, &c. There will be fencing bouts The Rev. Theodore 8. Brown, '44, of Chat- ham, died Thursday, Jan. 14, at the Albany Hospital where :lie had undergone a surgical operation. He had co.mpleted the sixteenth year of his pastorate at Chathatn and next spring would have completed his fiftieth year of service in the pulpit. .Mr. Brown graduated from the Princeton Theological Sen1inary. His five charges have been at New Concord, N. Y., Plainfield, N.J., Brooklyn, N. ¥., Dunellen, N. J., and Chat- · each week in the gym. and those who become proficient wil[ have an op,portunity to enter the mid-winter meet to earn points for their re- spective classes. It will be remembered that the mid-winter meet in 1895 was decided in favor of the class of '98 through the points wort in the fencing contests. ham, N.Y. He graduated from Union in the same class with Gen. J an1es C. Duane, Chief Engineer of_ the Army of the Potomac, Ex-Governor Rice of Massachusetts, Prof. Lamoroux, Col. Samuel T·. Richards, and Gen. Fred. Townsend. ,· \rl\ The Hon. Joel T. Headley, '39, another of Union's oldest alumni, died Saturday morning, Jan. 16, at his home in Newburg, N.Y., after a lingering illness of several weeks.. He was born at Walton, Delaware County, N.Y., Dec. 30, 1813, and after graduating from Union pur- sued a course at the Auburn Theological Semi- nary. Mr. Headley was famous both politically and as a man of letters, having been assemblyman in 1854 and secretary of the state of New York in x8s5-58, and author of many historical works. He was in early life pastor of a church at Stock- bridge, Mass., but illness caused him to resign. He went abroad and while there wrote ''Letters from Italy.\ He returned and becatne associate editor of the New York Tribune, then published by Horace Greeley, and after a year's service he resigned to devote his titne to authorship. His principal works are, '' Napoleon and his Marshals,\ \ Washington and his Generals,\ ''History of the War of 18 I z,\ \ Sacred Moun- tains,\ \The Great Rebellion,\ \ Grant and Sherman,\ '' Life of Farragut,\ and \ History of the Great Riots/' Mr. Headley has been president of the board of trustees of the Newburg Washington Head- quarters Association for over twenty-five years. Every man in ·c<;>llege should subscribe to the general welfare of the fencing club by giving it the benefit of his membership. A new set of officers has been elected as follows : President, Charles J. Vroontan; secretary, William D. Reed; treasurer, R. S. Hoxie; steward, Walter M. Swann. 5~e JlllisoQ-foote prize. The Allison-Foote prize was founded in 1895 by George F. Allison, '84, of New York city, and the Han. Wallace T. Foote, '85, of Port Henry, N.Y., for tl1e encouragement of debating in the literary societies at Union. 'l\he prize consists of $100 in cash, and is to be awarded as the result of a public competition between the members of the Adelphic and Philomathean societies. $50 will be awarded to the society presenting as a whole the strongest arguments and $5o wiU be awarded to the debator who makes the best single speech, regardless of his sQciety relations. The prizes thus far have been won by the Adelphic society and its members. The Philo- matheans are wotking very hard to win this year and an exciting debate is anticipated. Two very interesting articles from the pen of Prof. Ashmore have appeared in the New York Tribune recently on Spanish atrocities. The last one, in the issue of Monday, Jan. r8, should be read in connection with the first to be appreciated ..

THE INSERT which we have published this week is an excellent picture of the musical clubs of the college. Subscribers will undoubtedly appreciate the efforts of the Board of Editors to make THE CONCORDIENSIS as attractive as possible and will therefore send in their subscriptions at an early date. IN ANOTHER column we print a letter which touches upon a ve1·y important matter. The care- ful selection of patronesses to college affairs might result in much benefit to the college. It certainly would be more apt to create a kindly interest in the affairs of the college than would the mere re- printing of a long list of names which have been listed for the past ten or fifteen years. IN EARLY times what is now Ireland was called Scotia, and its inhabitants were known as Scoti; or Scots. A branch of this Scotic stock invading north Britain ultimately gave its name to all of what is now Scotland.-JJaily Gazette. From Scotland they came to America and settled on the banks of the Mohawk, when in time they were invaded by Mohawk Dutchmen from Schee nectady. What is our Scotia across the river, Irish, Scotch or Dutch? THE DECISION of tl1e Court of Appeals in refer- ence to the Fairweather will contest was handed down Tuesday. Union is again unlucky. The decision of the last court affirms the decision of Judge Truax who set aside the deed of gift made by the residuary legatees whereby Union w~s to have got $1:06.;000. Such a sum of money would have been very acceptable to the college in its present financial condition. IT IS rumored that a number of the Sophomore Soiree committee favor holding the annual. ball, given by that class, in the Edisori Hotel Dining room. Such a radical change should not be made without the most careful consideration of all those factors which go to make up a successful dance. Any change, which would tend to lessen the expense to the individual, wGuld be a great ::td- vantage, but if such a change would, at the ,same time, lessen the attendance, the danger of running behind would be nearly as gr~at. The experiment, however, might be well worth trying. IN .A. previous editorial, mention was made of the dilapidated condition of the windows in the round building, and it was saggested that they be repaired so as. to prevent injury which might come to the interio1· of building. We notice that repairs are at present in progress. It should have been done before this. During the strong wind which was blowing last Monday, one of the students saw a large portion of one of the upper windows blown out and broken into small pieces. The windows may not be of much service and hardly worth the expense of repairing, but the. interior would be very seriously damaged if the windows were not covered so as to prevent the wind and rain from entering the building. The method of repairing may be more serviceable than ornamental. A little dark paint, however, would serve to cover the ansightly patches. THE STUDENTS tu1•ned out well to the concert. We compliment all of those who went, upon their college spirit and evident intention to support college affairs. It is to be regretted, however, that there we1•e any who stayed away. Perhaps some of those who did were obliged to on account of other more pressing engagements. If such was the case they will probably hand the manager the price of the tieket, notwithstanding the fact that they were not there. So far as the towns-people are concerned, with the exeeption of five or six and perhaps a few more

A large number of ·Chi Psi fraternity men will attend from Union .and a general good time is expected. There will also be a large delegation frotn Williams College and Cornell University where the fraternity is especially strong. There will also be delegations of Chi Psi men from Troy, Hudson, Kingston, New York, Utica, Binghamton and Buffalo. ~~arter Day. The one hundred and second anniversary of the granting of the original charter to Union College will be celebrated Thursday, Feb. x8, with appropriate exercises. The Rev. Henry Van Dyke will lecture in the afternoon and the annual Allison-Foote prize debate between the Adelphic and Philo- mathe~n societies will be held in the evening. The anniversary vviH be further commemorated by the Sophomore soiree the following evening. Charter day w.as celebrated for the fin;t time last year and the success of the undertaking warranted making it an annual event. The faculty of t11e Albany Medical College have made the following appointments for the '97 honor stage : Reuben H. Irish, Elizabeth- town, N.Y.; John W. Travelt Troy, N.

But · he won on the point of delivery, the judges · having marked him down on composition and thought. He was expelled but the judges were · beyond discipline.- The Cornell Dally Sun. The students of Lehigh University have be- come interested in debating to such an extent that it was necessary for the two clubs to have . en]arged quarters. Last week took place the dedication of the Agora and Forum Debating Hall. Appropriate ceremonies were held which included an address by Dr. Brown, president of the university. Delegates were appointed from the two clubs to make arrangements with the annual Lafayette-Lehigh debate. In the intercollegiate chess tournament held in New York this vacation Harvard proved her- self an easy winner. A very enjoyable musical was given at the University of Pennsylvania last term in aid of the Cuban fund, in tnemory of W. D. Osgood, '94· AMERICAN SCHOOL AT ATHENS. The fifteenth annual report of the American School at Athens has just been published. It is announced that Professor J. R.

'Twenty- two American colleges and universities now belong to the association which supports this school.- The Exon-lon. COURSE IN RAILROADING. It has been proposed by several rail way pres- idents to establish a college course for the edu- cation of young men in the science of railroading. This would be a new departure in America but would tend to raise the standard of railway work in the future. The proposed course is to embrace most of the branches of study which lead to the degree of Bachelor of Science, together with the fund ... amental principles of civil and tnechanical en- gineering. It is proposed to add to this a large range of special study in railroading; covering history, organization and administration, law accounts and rates, the relations of the railroads. to each other and to ~the states, and the history of associations and commissions. Many railroad presidents have expressed opinions that young men can no longer get sufficient knowledge of the various departments. of .a railroad in the office., and that managers are handicapped by the fact that the ranks of. r~il­ way employes are not filled by men of tratntng. and ambition. It has been said that it is itnpossible to find enough subordinat~s with broad intelligence and trained minds. NEW ENGLAND COLLEGES. According to statistics gatberd by the World's Almanac for I 897, the colleges and other institu- tions of learning in this country have had con- siderable growth during the past year, notwith- standing the prevail in~ '' ha:d times.\ T.he New England colleges 1n particular show, wtth only a few inconsiderable exceptions, an in- crease in the number of students registered. Benefactions in 1896 were, as a rule, smaller than usual, but the larger colleges, such as Har- v·ard, Yale, Technology and Brown, have all received considerable financial aid. In round numbers, Harvard has been the gainer to the extent of $250,000; Yale, $290,000 ; Mass. In- stitute of Technology, $86,ooo; lvit.

The ·Concordicnsis VoL. XX. UNION :COLLEGE, JANUARY ·27, 1897. No. 16. The Musical clubs followed their concert in Schenectady by appearing in Canajohane, Fri- day evening, Jan. 22d. The concert was given in W~gner Opera Hall. The hall will com- fottably seat about six hundre.d. The acoustic properties are splendid. The home concert was ... considered an excellent performance, at which all tried to do their best ; but the concert at Canajoharie was thought by all who heard both to be far superiot· in every way. This can be . explained in part by the absence of the nervous- . ness which is generally present at the first con- cert of the year. In a great degree it was due to the excellent acoustic properties of the hall; and also to the hearty applause by which the audience expressed their appreciation. The Glee club was the principal attraction. The \Popular Potpourri\ which was received with. so much favor at the Schenectady concert made an exceptional hit at Canajoharie. The Banjo club is always a favorite and was · unusually popular last Friday. The only diffi- culty was in their inability through lack of pre- paration 'to respond to the call for encores. The ''Coat of Arms March\ was received better than theb: other selection, but both were loudly ap- plauded. The Mandolin club made great i tnprovement ovel' 1heir pia ying at Schenectady and received merited and hearty applause. The quartet selection, rendered by Messrs. Greene, Hinman, Eames and MacMahon, was received with un- usual fervor and they responded with an encore. Mr. Cook's recitations may be said to have been one of the most popular features of the en- tertainment. He did far better than at the first concert. His selection of encores was better and he pleased the audience so much that he was compelled to respond again and again. As usual the concert closed with the ''Union\ songs followed by a rousing good cheer. After the concert, the floor was cleared and an informal dance arranged by the ladies of Canajoharie and Palatine Bridge was given. Q.!1ite a number of the college students who do not belong to the clubs went along with the clubs and enjoyed the dance afterwards. They all had a good time. The girls of Canajoharie and Palatine Bridge will always he remembered for their cordial hospitality and the pleasant dance which all enjoyed very n1uch. Some were unfortunately obliged to leave on an early train. Light refreshments were served. The dance broke up about z o''clock. The Patronesses were : Mrs. G. W. Van Vlack, Mrs. Fraiser Spraker, Mrs. Benjamin Smith, Mrs. Frank Kirby, Mrs. D. S. Mon·el, Mrs. Homer Williams, Mrs. James H. Cook, Mrs. W. N. Johnston, Mrs. A. B. Frey, Mrs. Martin L. Smith, Mrs. N. S. Brumley, Mrs. E. Lipe, Mrs. J. C. Beach, Mrs. C. H. McKins- stry, and Mrs. A. G. Richmond. The ushers for the concert were : Miss Bertha Lipe, Miss Carrie Frey, Miss Laura De Clerque, Miss Clat·a Lewis, Miss Florence Smith, and Miss Jes&ie Cook. A meeting of the Shakespeare Club was held last Thursday evening, at 7: 30 o'clock in Prof. Truax's room. Work was planned for the term. New members and the following new officers were elected: President, Hotaling't '97; vice- President, Swann, '98 ; Secretary, Hartnagle, '98; Treasurer, MacMahon, '99andan Executive Committee consisting of Nelson, '98; D. Wood, '97 ; Hotaling, '97 ; MacMahon; '99 and French, '99·

4: THE CONOORDIIDNSIS .. ·-Day of prayer ~:elebrated. The annual Day of Prayer for colleges was celebrated in the chapel last Thursday morning by an eloquent and impressive sermon by Presi- dent Raymond. ':rhe Reverend Messrs. Sewell and Stevenson assisted in the services. The auditorium was well filled with students, the faculty and their families, and friends of the .college. . Dr. Raymond took. for his text, the words of Christ as recorded in Matthew IV: 19, \Follow me.\ Every complex system, the speaker said, :has at its core some simple principle; the modern locomotive for example, the expansion of steam ; calculus, the plain arithmetic. So religion, when freed from all the intricacies of scholastic theology, has for its very foundation, the simple vvords of Christ, \ Follow me.\ They are especially significant for when fitst used, they were addressed to young men. And to young 1nen they make their strong~st appeal to-day, for they offer a personal relationship with Christ. It is our personal relationships which make us, not our theories nor intellectual requirements. Through associat.ion, the apostles learned of Christ, caught his spirit, became like him in their attitude,. both toward God and men. This is the sutn and substance of the blessedness offered by Christianity, and anything that makes this blessedness sotnething exterior to ourselves is mockery. A weedy tract is only reclaimed by supplanting the weeds with wheat. Our 1ives are redeetned in the same way. The character and conduct of every man are determined by theauthoritywhich he recognizes; and even in this age of liberty, authority is in- evitable. This directs study to the character of 'Christ to learn why we should heed his com- mand, \Follow me.\ There is only gain in this, for the better he is known, the greater will be his power. What virtue can be named not found perfectly developed in this Jesus of Naza- reth ; honesty, kindness, cout~tesy, courage, truthfulness, unworldliness, unselfishness, purity, reverence, gentleness, charity, and with all these ~wisdom so profound that all the thought of the world has failed to exhaust the meaning of his words. So he who responds to the claim of Christ ·simply follows the truest, holiest itn- pulses of his nature. He who rejects this claitn stifles these impulses and condemns hin1self. The sermon was closed with a strong appeal to all young men to heed the example of Chtist, ·.and thus become the noblest men possible. The discourse throughout was , one of \'exceeding power and beauty. We regret the want of space that forbids a fuller account. 'J'lew Yor~ State II]ter~~oHeqiate jltl}letie UQiOI). Last November representative~ from Roches- ter, Hobart, Syracuse, Hamilton, Colgate and Union came together at Utica to discuss the organization of a new athletic association. The work of preparing a constitution and by-laws was only begun and the details were left to a committee of one from each institution :repre- sented. The commi.ttee had its first m.eeting last Saturday at Baggs' Hotel in Utica. Rochester was represented by Cub ley, '97, Syracuse by Fikes who is well known to the students of Union, Hamilton by Prof. Squires, Colgate by Prof. Crawshaw, and Union by Birch, '97· The meeting was called to order by Mr. Glass of Hamilton, secretary of the previous conven- tion!~ and Union's delegate was tnade chainnan. After some prelitninary discussion as to the powers of the committee, the work of forming a constitution and by-laws was entered upon. As there appeared to be a New York State Inter- Collegiate Athletic Association, in track athletics, consisting of Syracuse, Rochester and Hobart, it was decided to call the new organization New York State Inter-~ollegiate Athletic Union. The union will be for the purpose of purifying athletics and raising the standard of scholarship. The management of the union will be entrusted to an advisory board which shall be made up of three representatives from each college. Of every delegation one must be a mernber of the faculty, one an alumnus, and one a student. Every college wi~l be represented on all com- mittees of the board and also the committees will have an equal number of professors, alumni and students. The de£nition of an amateur as given in the constitution and by-laws of the Inte1·-Collegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America was adopted, but this article as well as the others will not be retroactive. The article which will affect the number of colleges that will compose the union is the one requiring of every contestant that he must be a candidate fot a degt·ee or taking at least twelve hours per week of recitations. Hamilton, Colgate and Union are in favor of it and in fact would desire the limit raised. Rochester and Syracuse are verv much opposed, as it will cut off tnany spe .. cial students. Hobart is in doubt. More

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 5 than two term conditions will debar athletes from participating in games. Provision is rnade · for the enforcement of the payment of guarantees and also penal ties for the violation of the rules :are stipulated. Much credit is due to Prof. Squires of Hamil- ton for his efforts in bringing the colleges to- ~ether. He is enthusiastic over athletics giving liberally to the support of the teatns of his own in~titution, yet, at the same· time, keeping in m1nd tha~ the colleges stand for scholarship first. It 1s to be regretted that all the colleges cannot mea~ure up to the requirements pro- posed, but the professor will find no more en- thusiastic co-laborers than at uold Union.\ The Chi Psi alumni association of eastern New York, held their annual meeting and ban- quet at the Kenmore Hotel, Albany, last Friday evening. Union sent its entire chapter and there were goodly representations from Wil- liams, Hamilton, Rutgers and Cornell. The following officers were elected': President, Dr. Cyrus S. Merrill, of Albany; vice-presidents, W. Scott Hunter, of Schenectady ; Col. W m. H. Fox, of Albany ; secretary, Jatnes H. Calla- han, of Albany; treasurer, Edmund C. Knicker- bocker, of Albany; executive committee, the Rev. Free born G. Jewett, of Albany ; W m. C. Vrooman, of Schenectady; H. Miles Nims, of Troy ; Gen. James G. Rogers, of Sandy Hill, and Chas. H. Van Auken, of Cohoes. The next banquet will be held in January, 1898, and probably in Albany. Bound volutnes of the Butterfield course of lectures are for sale at the Registrar's office. The price has been reduced for students, from $3.00 to $r .50 per volume. Chancellor James R. Day, of Syracuse Uni- versity ; Andrew V. V. Raymond, President of Union University; Francis Hovey Stoddard, of New York University, and Prof. G. M. Forbes, of Rochester University, have forwarded to the regents for consideration next March, resolu- tions embodying their views on the L. T. B. degrees. Gl]e 8opl]omore Soiree. 'The arrangements for the Sophomore Soiree, which will be held at the Van Curler, Friday evening, Feb. 19, are rapidly approaching com ... pletion. The comtnittee is putting forth every possible effort to make the '99 Soiree one to be long retnetnbered as a successful college dance. August Elgie and his excellent orchestra of ten ' pieces have been engaged to furnish music for the event. Elgie's Orchestra has played at all the principal society events in Albany during the past year, and given entire satisfaction. Five different bids for refreshments have been received frotn the leading caterers of Albany, Troy, Utica and Schenectady, and the contract has been awarded to Colburn of Albany, whose menu was superior to any of the others. The two front rows of seats in the orchestra • circle will be removed, thus making room for three more boxes. The boxes will be disposed of at public auction, on Tuesday afternoon w ' Feb. 9; no bid of less than $ro will be accepted. The floor will be thoroughly renovated and covered with new crash before the Soiree. The patronesses are : Mrs. Andrew V. V. Raymond, Mrs. James L. Patterson, Mrs. I. B. Priee, Mrs. Olin H. Landreth, Mrs. James R. Truax, Mrs. Edward Everett Hale, Jr., Mrs. Sidney G. Ashmore, Mrs. Maurice Perkins, lvirs. C. P. Linhart, Mrs. James H. Stoller, Mrs. George W. Gibson, Mrs. Elton D.

Smitley, Mrs. Bonesteel, Mrs. James K. Strain, Mrs. Clinton C. Brown, Mrs. Charles S. Prosser, Mrs. D. Green and Mrs. L. Gibson. L. D. Russell, '97, and H. A. Hinman, 'g8, of Middleburg, and L. D.

IT IS a pleasure to note the complimentary notice which appeared in the Canajoharie news- paper of this week regarding the concert given by the musical clubs of this college. It is evident that there is a strong feeling of good will for Union in that neighborhood. It has already been reflected by the students, who unite in praising the people of that locality for their most hospita- ble treatment on Friday last. THE P .A.RTHENON appeared this week in a new cover. If you like it, tell your friends you do ; if you don't, keep still. The object of the editors in making the change is obvious to a.ny person who has any artistic taste. The contents of the 1nagazine are sufficiently varied to satisfy most of its readers. If you have any criticisms to make they are not wanted. Sug- gestions along with manuscript for the February number will be gladly accepted by the editors. THE second volume of a small publication. en- titied ''Cap and ·Gown,\ and containing original college verse, is about to be published. The editor of THE OONCORDIENSIS has been requested to send a ntunber of poems written by Union OoUeg~ students to the editors of this volun1e. If there are any students in college who have written any verses .appropriate .for this book, and desire to have them published, please to mail such v·erse to the editor of THE 00NCORDIENSIS at the earliest date pGssible. WE understand that it has been definitely de- cided to hold the Sophornore Soiree in the Van Curler. Now that such a detern1ination has been reached, it behooves all conceTned to spa1·e no pains to make the dance a success both financially and socially. The difficulty in the past has been due to ill-considered extravagance and to a lack of business foresight in the sale of tickets. The principle source of revenue is derived frorn the sale of tickets thus tickets must be sold. It is useless and foolish to speculate upon how many will be sold and then make no effo1·t to dispose of thmn. Such a method will as it has in the past, result in a large deficit. We would call the committee's at- tention to the letter which appeared in last week's CoNCORDIENSIS and advise that some of the sug- gestions therein contained be followed. IN ANOTHER column of this paper is found a de- scription of the new water supply for Schenectady. Such an innovation is rightly hailed with delight by every resident of the city. For years Schenec- tady has borne an unenviable reputation as a typhoid fever center, due to its infected water supply. The Mohawk is a beautiful river to look upon but it bas always proved itself to be a re- lentless destroyer when used as a beverage. The benefi.cient effects of the change from Mo- hawk to spring water is certain to be enjoyed by the college. Union has suffered immeasurably in. the past from the justifiable supposition by out- siders that every student who entered must for four years be subjected to a more or less intimate acquaintance with the typboid germ. Such a condition of things is now of the past. Good water, an efficient system of sewerage, good air and plenty of exercise for the individual student will make Union as healthful an institution of learning as can be found in the land. IT SEEMS necessary again to refer to the abuses which continue to exist in the use of the library. About two-thirds of the student body seem to think that the '\'\lay to obtain privileges is to ab~se tpose they already have. Tbe college furnishea a building for library pu.rposes. · It is aston~~~~~

THE CONOORDIENSIS. 1 how many students are ignorant of what is meant ,· by ''library purposes.\ Some think the ball is a · place in which to take an hour's daily exercise. ' They promenade from one end to the other and .are not the least careful regarding the sound of their footfall. Every day Dr. Nott's old stove is i -critically examined. The lid is removed and then : replaced with a bang.. The portrait above the : mantle is studied from all points of advantage. The tablets on the center table are read for about the fiftieth time by some students and lifted by way of e~ereise by others. A large majority never -thinkofspeakinginawhisper; they abhore silence. When they sit down they make a racket and when they get up they make a racket. They observe only one rule and probably would not observe that if it were not the cast iron, non- breakable rule of the librarian to keep your hats off regard- less of drafts and frigid temperature. persoQals.

The people of Schenectady since Friday last have been enjoying a bounteous supply of clear, pure spring water. The new water supply station which i:s located near Rotterdatn, about two miles outside of the city, has been com- pleted and at the present time about 6,ooo,ooo gallons are being putnped fro1n the new wells which is about four titnes as 1nuch as the city needs. The surplus is allowed to run away by . wasteful consumers, who allow the water to run from the faucets so as to prevent them from freezing. 1'he impurity .of Schenectady's water supply has for many years been the cause of her high death rate and that directly due to the typhoid germ which was always present in the water taken from the Mohawk rive1A. The existence of the large spring on the site of the new water plant was known to have ex- isted for many years. The immense volumn of water however which finds its way by this underground channel into the river was not ap- preciated until after the tests n1ade in the spring of r895· It was then ascertained that there was sufficient water running under a comparatively thin stratum of gravel and clay hardpan to sup- ply the entire city of Schenectady. It is not necessary for the purposes of this article to enter upon a detailed account of the actions of the various administrative bodies of the city of Schenectady tending towards the acquirement of their new water supply.. It is sufficient to say that a chemical and biological analysis of the water shows it to be absolutely free from impurities. For some time it was supposed that the water reached into the wells from the neighboring river. The geological formation of the river valley and the nature of the earth deposit which tops the solid rock at this locality, makes such a condition improb- able if not in1possible. About two feet of gravel and· clay intervenes between the river bottom and the wells and the dip of the rock at this point is away from the wells and toward the river rather than otherwise. Chemical analysis shows the water to he two points harder than the river water and to con- tain one-third less chlorine. This shows the water to be entirely different in character to that which flows in the river. Dr. Perkins is making a very careful analysis of the watet·. He says that if the supply continues unabated, Schenectady will have the finest water used in any city east of the MississiP.J?i river.

8 THE OONCORDIEN·SIS. The University of Tokio, Japan, has 1300 • students. Pri nee ton received gifts of over $I .,ooo,ooo at · her recent ·sesquicentennial. Hamilton has recently received a gift of money with which to build a science building. The Harvard faculty have refused to allow the Glee club to make its annual western trip. A woman's gymnasium, to cost $5o,ooo, will soon be built at the University of Michigan. Vice-President-elect Garret A. Hobart has presented $5000 to Rutgers college, of which college he is an alumnus. When Stanford University shall have received its final share of the Stanford estate it will be · three times as rich as Harvard. The University of Paris is considering the establishment of a degree especially for foreign students.-Cornell Dally Sun. Postmaster-General W m. L. Wilson, on re- tiring from the cabinet, will assume the presi- dency ofWashington and Lee University. The will of the late· Dr. Gardiner H. Scudder bequeaths a portion of his estate to the Harvard University Corporation, but provides that it be not used for scholarships. Of the men who have made up the All American Foot Ball teatns since the first one in 1890 Yale has had fifteen, Princeton thirteen, Harvard ten, Pennsylvania eight and Cornell one.-Pennsylvanian. The committee of college graduates who have had the management of the annual Yale-Prince- ton foot ball game in hand for the past five years, after careful deliberation, have decided to urge the colleges to hold their annual games and all their athletic contests on college grounds. J. P. Hamilton, a blind stunent of the Uni- versity of Michigan, holds seven first prize medals for catch-as-catch-can wrestling. He has never been beaten at wrestling inside of his own class. He won the state championship at the intercollegiate meet. Professo1 4 Emerson, of Amherst, will visit St .. Petersburg next August as a delegate to the International Geological Congress to be held in that city. The delegates will be guests of the· Czar, and arrangements have been made for a trip through the Ural Mountains, and an excur- sion to the Caspian Sea. In the New TOrk Tlmes of Jan. 9, Sir John Lubbocl1 says that a tnistake is 1nade in limiting· elementary education too closely to reading,. writing and arithmetic.. He told the Modern Language association, at its recent me~ting in London, that a knowledge of one or more foreign languages vastly increases a young man's. chances of securing remunerative employment,. and suggested the acquisition of ~panish as especially important just now, owing to Eng- land's keen desire to secure trade in South America.

Curves of 14 inches in 70 feet are obtained by a simple device, whereby the ball in passing out rubs against a piece of rubber on one side of the barrel, the friction giving it a rotary motion. It has been found that after a little practice, balls may be pitched from the gun much more accurately than from the human hand. The gun is an im- provement on the pitcher in two ways : That
