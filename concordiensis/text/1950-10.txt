L YAMITY AIU18'1141VII.D FRIDAY, OCT08ER 6. 1950 My Word! by r had originally planned to discuss another topic this week but~ by la d d I am g oing to comment on the Tuesday cb,apel talk by · popu r eman , . J. Edward Carothers. · . . , FOR THOSE who did not hear h1m, Mr. Carothers argu~ent was that college graduates do not as a group assume the . p~ace m __ society .. for which their ability and training makes them .el~g~ble. .A:l~hough I disagr'ee with the gentleman~s apparen~ Implication_ that gomg to · college by itself puts a person in a superxor· class,I Wlll go along en- thusiastically with the idea that most _college graduates, f).! even most college students, could play a more her:olC role_ than they at present do. Mr Carothers went on to point out .that college educated people • are ge~era;lly satisfied with merely appreciating the exfstence: of a problem and are loathe, ·because of person~! conservatism an_d rehcence, to trying to alleviate it. He ~en.t on to g1v~ exa.mples. of th1s tendency, . mentioning politics and the wmmng of elections m wh1ch so-calle~ ward · heelers have traditionally held the balance of power; but he d1d not, ' I feel, go very deeply into the reasons w~y these circ~stanc~s are· so, : probably because of the limitation of time. In thlnkmg th1s matter . over, I have come to the conclusion that there are thr~e outstanding reasons. , FIRST unlike American society at large, college students are not divided ev~nly between the relatively well-to-do and the relatively needy. · and hence to a fairly equal ·degree between ·con~;Iervativ:es and .liberals. . .Although there has been a definite and praiseworthy trend in recent · years toward admitting deserving students to college regardles!') -of financial means, it still can be trutl;l.fully said, I think, that moiSt stu, · ·dents, especially at the small independent colleges, come from 1,1pper middle class homes where the tone is essentially conservative, More'- . over, many poorer students aim, by getting a college education, to raise themselves to the social-class of which the majority of their fel~ows are- members and, therefore; adopt the prevailing conservative attitude·, . Second, there is rarely a shift in the control of college executive· power, as In American government, from conservative to ·liberal and : back again. Tl).is fact is due, of course, to educational institutions Jllt-df Ult.-f • blind elate!

Although many graduates have to take further training at .. special professional schools, the -preparation they receive as under- graduates at what are called liberal arts colleges is usually narrowly : specialized.

By Don Schwartz For better than 59 )nintltes of old fashioned. football, it appeared as though the cherished 13 defeatless 1:1treak, : nurtured a.t Union since t h e t hi r d game of .the 1948 season, was going to stick. Then big. Jack Metraw, St. L4l. w r.e n c e full~ back,. took a deep pitchout from q\Uartel~back Jack O'Lau g h lin and cut back to the Garnet 20. There two tired Union forwards charged him, but couldn't 'hold him. Metraw was on the 5 before he was stopped and Bobby ReyeU crashed over tackle on the next play to ~?core. Three plays later the game was· over and so was an era in Union football. The tables were turned in that gam,e. No longer was lJilion send- ing. iD: flock'!f of fresh substitutes to wear down the opposition. Now· it was a weary Dutchmcan forward wall which was holding off re· peated touchdown bids. It was in· eVitable, though, that the hard run• iling of halfbacks Reyell and John Ya:nnes woW.tl eventually pay off. Coach Sam Hammerstrom stated a:fter the game that he was pleased with his defense. The offense, which was supposed to be the stronger of the two, was disappoint- ing as the statistics will show. Run- ning and passing the ·Garnet ac- cumulated 79 yards and gained 5 first downs to· 14 for the winners. Not every team will be as tough as St. Lawrence !Jut W~s is one of those that will. The Ephmen were slaug]ltered by Princeton, 66-0, last Saturday, but a glance at their lineup indicates tl)at they'I'e loaded for small college football, What's more, they're deeper 'in capable re- serves than St. Lawrence. Traditional rival, RPI, tomor- row's opponent, doesn't rate with either of the above mentioned teams, but they do have a heavy line. I think that will· count more to their advantage than the fact that this is a traditional rivalry. Hammerstrom came· up with some good defensive pla.yers who hadn't bee11 in the limelight pre- viously. Dick Nemeth played a fine game backing up and up front, John Kennedy was impressive. Ed Lel\lay, pa.rticularly on his touch- down run, proved he was .a good pass defender. The old standbys were as good, or better than ever. Cookie Sherwin was magnificent. 'Nuff said. Jerry O'Laughlin, Gerry Parker, and of course, co-captain Chuck .Abba who played 60 minutes, were all out- standing. An offense, the team just could not get rolling. 'rhe pony backfield was. no match for a fresh, heavy defensive Larrie line. Scott Jack· son was the leading ground gainer, but Bill Snyder was the workhorse.

(If the President does not sign a bill Within ten days of its passage, and Congress adjourns within that time, the bill does not become law.) If Truman had pocket-vetoed the Mc- Carran Bill, it would not be law today. The American people would have bad the opportunity to express their will In the November elec- tions before Congress reconvened. Or perhaps the veto was a political maneuver to allow HST and the Democratic Party to stand on both sides of the felice at the same time. L a.

OCTOBER 13., 1950 'My Word! by Son Cregier Last week I noted briefly that the c:~mnec~icut chapt~r ?f J;>hi Epsilon Pi fraternity had been censured by 1ts nat10nal orga.mzabon for Initiating a Negro student, and tha:t th_e local. ~hapter had gwen the na- ti\onal two weeks in which to reverse 1t.s dec1s1on or the chapter would withdraW from the fraternity. There have _been furt)ler dev.elopments ln the case, includ\ing the indefinite suspens1on of the ConectJCut chap- ter; decision by three other local chapters, at City College (where_ the fraternity was founded in 1904), NYU, ~~d Queens Col:e!\e to disaf- filiate if the national continued its oppos1t1on;_ and~ petttlon _endorsed b fifteen eflstern chapters to the grand councrl urgmg recqns1deration. y THE COLLEGE social fraternity is a typically- American institution., 1 si!Ytilar in n.any ways _to other fratern~l g:o~tps tbe _world over ~ut in many resperts very dtfferent. The ch1ef mduence m Hl:e. crea;t10~ _of college fraternities was, I think, the spread of. RomantlCJ~m m liter- ature and thought to the United States from. Euvope and.

Union Co\llege was an exception, and ::t _Union the fraternity:, with its secr•et ritual. exo~i\c emble:r;ns, and, or1gma:lly, Bo- hemian tone had its birth and has smce flourtshed. Since 1825, however. American society has changed, . college cur\ ricula have been expanded, and the status of the fratermty ·has as a !'esult been altcrP.d. No longer a source of agitation .and revolt against the faculty and administration. the fraternity has over the years become · an accepted part of college life: Nevertheless, although the fraternity system ·has grown physica·lly to Iarge proportions. its intellectual growtll has not kept pace. Many of tl::)e characteristics of society' and especially of that :part of society which furnished most coll\ege students duri._ng the fraternity's childhood and adolescence, such .as a distrust for minority t·aces and religions, a feeling that wealth and culture were mutually dependent, and a desire to uphold a ·set of traditions at all cost, are no -longer in keeping with the spirit. which exists today.

More Centralization FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1950 My Word! by Don Cregier Last week I noted briefly that the c:onnec~icut chapt~r ?f Phi Epsilon Pi f.ra·temity had been censured by 1ts national orgll;mzatwn for initiating a Negro student, a-nd that th_e local_ ~hapter had go~.ven the na- tional two weeks in which to reverse 1!:> dec1s10n or the chapter would withdraw from the fraternity. There have _been further dev~lopments 1 th se includ·ing the indefinite suspension of the ConectJCut chap- . r~r; ~<'~~sio'n by thrPe other local chapters, at City College (where_ the fratt>rnity was founded in 1904>, NYU, ~~d Queens Col~e~e, to dtsaf- filiate if the national continued its 0ppos1twn;_ and ?- pehtwn _endor~ed b . fifte:en eastern chapters to t·he grand councl'l urgmg recons1deratlon. ) THE COLLEGE social fraternity is a typically American institution, similar in n 1 any wrrys to other fratcrn~l g-ro~ps the _world over ?ut in many respects \'Pn' ·di.ffN<>nt. The ch1ef mduence m th_e. crell;tw~· of college fraternities was, l think. the spread of Romant1c1~m m liter- ature and tltou;.;ht tc. .the Unit~d States .from_ Euro_Pe and_ 1ts contact, and conflict with thr clRssi<'al curriculum whtch st1ll obtamed at most American c~lJpgcs. Uniol'l Col!Pge was an exception, and at Union the fraternity, with it~ secret ritual. exotic emble';lls, and, originally, Bo- hemian tone had its birth and has since flounsh<ed. Since 1825, how~vrr. Amel'ican society has changed, college cur- ricula have bet•n <!Xpand'ed. and the ~tatus of the fraternity has as a result l,ecn alterPd. No longer a source of agitation and revolt against the faculty and administration, the> fraternity has over the years become a·n accepted part of collrge life. Nevertheless, although the fraternity system has grown physically to large proportions, its intellectual growth \ . and what did you do last weekend?\ · has not ke>pt pace. Many of the characteristics of society and especially of that ·part of society which furnished most college students duri_ng the fraternity's childhood and adolescence, such as a distrust for . minority races and religions, a feeling that wealth and culture were mutually dependent, and a desire to uphold a set of traditions at all cost, are no ·longer in }{eeping with thtl spirit which exists today. THERE ARE many people, usuaHy not connected with fraternities, who hold that they are useless if not harmful anachronisms; while most fraternity membe1 s hold the Greek system in uncritical veneration. Neither vie\\· is sound. Group action is usually more effective than individual action; and for this reason if for no other fraternities should Meet Wilifried Hofmann By William Hoffman Wilifried Hofmann is the,.name of the H.E.L.P. student staying at the Psi U house, but he will appreciate it if you call him \Bill\. Bill was born in Aschaffenburg, Germany, \\'hich is 26 miles cast of Frank- fort. Bill lived in this Bavarian town for all of his 19 ye>ars, and the milk they have in Aschaffen- burg must be good because it has produced a 6'1'', blonde-haired, brown-t>yt>d, 157 pound lad. AFTER t>ight ypars in high ~C'hool, Rill graduated this past Jut~·- H<' had to lt'arn three foreign languages during this eight year tenute, nnd selected Latin, French, and Engli~h.

Thr first qut>stinn this reportE'r '\l<t·d wa, thP traditional \\\'hat do yuu lhmk of An!<'rtl'a?\ The things that 1m pressed Bill most was the casual and frien<\}y air of the American people. THE AMERICAN girl, however, is a problem to him. Bill said that it is easy to change a habit like style of dress, but it is hard to become used to the American girl. He finds her, however, more ag- gressive, more mature, and more· vivacious than the German girl. ·The point that impressed him most about Union College was the way in which the freshmen are supervised. In Germany, the stu- dents have academie freedom. They may ·change a subject and no one will know the difference. He was also surprised by the '54 buttons. In Germany, you cannot be sure when you will finish your education. TURNING to the world situation, Rill is positiVE' that Russia will at- tack Wc•stern Europen and that if East Germany had the chanc<', it would overrun V\'est Germany. American help is definitely needed in this vital sel'tor. \Vhc•n hP r..turns to Germany. Bill hopes to become a lawyer, and we would like to add our \good luck'' to an ever-growing list.

The HELP plan at Union is a familiar example of worthwhile contributions by fraternities, and there are many others. The bad side of fraternities has received more publicity, however. Intolerance, snobbery, racial discrimination as in the case of Phi Epsilon Pi. and general looseness and ineffectual- ness are inherent singularly or collectively in many fraternities. If they are to be effective, or merely if they are to survive, fra- ternities must bring their principles and actions up to date. This may even mean the abolition of the secret ritual which, though harmless in itself, represents an exclusiveness which is not generally appreciated. Th black ball totally inconsistent with group democracy, and the hazing routine of Hell Week, pointless H not actually sadistic, must go by the board in favor of a broader outlook. Service both to their members and the college community is the only valid reason for the continued existence of fraternities and, if they are to survive as other than fossils, they must meet the challenge. The Connecticut t>hapter of Phi Epsilon Pi and the three chapters which supported it. are to be l'ommended for tlle positive approach they have taken.

Through his vision and his con- tinued effort in gathering the fin- ancial resources, the chaplain made always bcl'n open to us all, and many have come to know him and his wife as close personal friends. Students, faculty, and guests met often at tpc Browns, not only for friendly meetings and bull sessions, but usualy also to share some of Mrs. Brown'::~ delicious cooking. it possible for six Union students to ta:ke part in reconstruction and semina·r programs in Europe and two to develop community and medical centers in South America in the past two years. The fund now contains over one thousand dollars for the continuance of this vital work. This activity represents a unique program among the small colleges and has already done much to further international understand-· ing and social insight on our campus. The Sunday Church services have brought to our students some of the best of contemporary religious thinkers of the many different sects. ' The Tuesday assembly programs have presented outstanding men in expression of forthright opinions on current controversial issues and re- ligious thought and represents one of the few all-college public plat- forms at Union which has been continuously devoted to the prin- ciples of free inquiry and the fostering of mature social responsi- bility. THE HOSPITALITY of Chaplain Brown's office and his home have Chaplain Brown also di~ected the extra-curricular school of religion courses, was advisor of the Chris- tian Association, and was responsi- ble for the stimulating Religious Emphasis Week program, besides his regular duties as professor of religion and personal counselor. THE RESPECT which the chap- lain has engendered here at Union was expressed. last prize day when he., received the Lonard Suskind .Award for the promotion of liberal- ism in inter-racial activities, good will and freedom of speech. Such awards can only convey in ·part our recognition of Chaplain C. Vic- tor Brown's great contributon to Union College.

Sober Minds Gone? \The next fellow who wants to· .pledge has no personality, no looks, no social grace but, let's not fot•get his old man owns a distillery.\ · HELP Student Wonders .At Our Cutting .system By Mike Kahn '· FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, ~950 My Word! by Don Cregier The recent pronouncement in respect to deferment from the draft of superior college and university students eliminates one serious inconsistency ·but creates an ·even worse one. In World War II, it was the policy to defer certain scientific and ·engineering ·students whose continued training in these fields was· essential to the war effort. A similar provision is authorized by the Selective Service Law of 1948 but has not been widely applied because , the need has not arisen. The new plan, approve_d \in th main\ by General Hershey, is. entirely different. Instead of deferment being : limited to technical stude:ht.s, coll~ge men with \suprior· ability,\ re- .gardless of course, will .be permitted to proceed with their. education . uninterrupted. On the surface the ,plan looks good in one way. Many men Wll6; because of choice and aptitude, wel'e liberar al;'ts students failed to · see the logic in technical students being allowed to blissfully conUnue their studies while the former went off to help fight World War II. Now only the best students in all fields will stay in college while their less able and fortunate brethr.en will shoulder arms. . A· closer look at the various deferment proposals should, however, arouse considerable trepidatien in the minds of people who respect the dignity and worth of the individua1.

Yester- day another near serious accident occurred on campus when a student riding on the running board of a moving car fell off to be severely cut and bruised. o'clock neither the students nor the professors arrive before 8:15. This custom of arriving for appoint- ments fifteen minutes later than clock time is ·called, \Akademin- asche Vertetstude.\ , Hans has been very active in the Boy Scouts. While Hitler forced all the young men into the Nazi Youth, Hans joined the under- ground Boy Scouts. In 1947, he at- tended the International Scout Jamboree in France. (This year the Boy Scouts are holding their What's wr~ng with these prol?~s~ls? In th.e first place, they divide draft age men mto two rather artifiCial categories based on educational status. Men who are not qualified f?r or who do not want to ~o to college would, unlesft p~ys1cal!y unfit or exempted, for occupat-ional reasons, have . to serve m the armed forces. College men would thus occu~y a preferred P.o~ition which they do. not necessarily deserve. Th; . effe~t of such selectivity on the morale of draftees would certainly be detrimental. Secondly, those who did qualify for educational deferment would hav? to participate in a frenzied rat race to stay in the upper half of their class if deferment were to be extended. College life would be reduced to a dull grind in which interest in high marks for their ?wn sake would. pr.evail to the exclusion of other activities of equal If_ not greater Importance. · Thirdly, there would be the technical HANS STERNICK Have we lost our safety consciousness? Perhaps we are getting to be too ca1·eless or it is that all the sober minded and careful men left last year when most of the veterans graduated? A Good Choice We would like to publicly thank Dr. Stefan Osusky ·for corning, to Union for the past week. It has been a decided pleasure to have had such a clear thinking and well informed guest on our campus.- The College ought to be commended for making such an excellent choice and we hope that the other speakers this year will be just as well chosen.

' ' New Religious Adviser We are very glad to welcome Professor Taylor as our new Religious Advisor at Union College. There has always been some arrangement here for those who need or desire spiritual guidance. We are s~re that this will continue to be college policy. What Professor Taylor does in his capacity of religious advisor for the next few months will largely determine what the policy of the college wiil be toward the office of College Chaplain. The matter is to be under careful study by the trustees, the administration and several interested student o:rganizations. We feel confident that the Religious Advisor will fulfill his duties very ably to the satisfaction of all. · they are more shallow than we are used to in ·Europe.\ He says, cans but he thinks that our soldiers have given his people a distorted view of Americans. Letter to the Editor Dear Editor: Although I have only been on the campus a short time I feel that at last ~omething should be done about the amount of student APATHY ~hat e~sts. This is brought out by several situations that have occurred 111 the past month. ~ LIBRARY situation is old hash to most students so I will not go mto that. The lack of interest in world affairs is in the same category .s? I will avoid that topic. The total lack of respect to ladies, elderly Clbzens and many teachers need not be brought up. The pro- found rudeness to chapel speakers is apparent to all. There is no good reason that has been presented to me however for the lack of interest in voting, How many students that are old enough to vote bothered to register last week so that they could vote _for their state and federal representatives? Very few I assure you Y~ ~h:se same J?eople a~e the campus lawyers who are constant!~ critiCIZing those m Washmgton. My only comment is if you don't vote, shut up! ' Y<>urs truly, L.

Good Taste The Gridiron Ball committee should be congratulated on presenting an enjoyable program in ChaP,el last Monday without lowering itself to the use of material that was off color or beyond a reasonable standard of good taste. It just goes to show that a publicity event can be put on that is really funny without use of that \low form of college humor\ which has caused so much trouble in the past in public presentations of this sort. The committee has been doing a good job. We would like to see it continue. Experiment In Reasonableness Monday will mark the beginning of a two week experi- mental period in which the library will stay open to 10 :30 each evening. There is no doubt in our minds that the library will be used by a great portion of the student body during the new hours as has been the case for the past two weeks when quite a few used the round building in the center of our campus as long as they could. We feel that the demand for the library to remain open until 11 p.m. or at least 10:30 p.m. all of the time on week days, warants such a move on the part of the librarian. No doubt the very fact that we should be so \mistaken\ as to suggest such a thing will doom it. It no longer seems to be a case of not being able to do this thing because of budget cuts but more a matter of defining demand. How- ever we will try to keep up our optimistic hope and belief in the reasonableness of the administration and the library Book Shelf HOUSE OF BREATH By William Goyen , Reviewed by R. E. B. Among the newer American novelists whose work is interesting as well as fecund is to be added William Goyen whose recent novel, \House of Breath\ is a subtle and polished reminiscence of a deca.- dent Southwestern family of which a runaway part has been dealt cardily with by a much extolled fate and yet been allowed to return in caricature to the crumpling house of breath. Among those who have remained, (yet blown away) are tragedies of far .from normal minds and unusual, earthy, win- ning-by-losing happenings. THE STYLE is derivative of James Joyce in cast and, is yet lyric and smooth generally. The thought reflects strongly rejection of a realists present and a back- ward-moving search for oneself, so reminiscent, yet more quietly, of Thomas Wolfe. It is a settled and intelligent nature which can in- quire so calmly and so forcefully into the ceaseless quests of the most down-and-out of our race. It is worth a great many courses in any school to have come to such a sympathy devoid of anything sticky or wishy-washy. The book is far more obscure in places than is this review, but Goyen relies on a musical voice and a fine emotional development to carry interest throughout. Letter to the Editor Union College Students: Just how impolite can you become at chapel? Was noon Tuesday your finest example? WHERE were your manners? Have you ever heard of the word? They are the amenities used to show respect for another person. Because a young lady, Miss Hyla Stuntz, spoke longer than is the custom of chapel speakers, you intellectual giants and common courte- ous midgets squirmed in your seats and coughed in your neighbors' faces evidently trying to show your displeasure. If you had gotten up and walked out, you would have conveyed your meaning to the speaker more politely and would have not embarrassed your fellow students with your presence. IF YPUR fatuous simpering was meant to indicate doubt about the young lady's conduct on her travels, especially with one of your fellow students, it did. Is womanhood no longer respected and vener- ated? It's about as subtle as a sledge hammer blow; watch out that it doesn't rebound someday and hit you on the head. Why not change places with an ape? At least, he is ign:orant of his discourtesy. C. LITTL~ '53 Dear Sirs: We have noticed that Thanksgiving recess as stated in the college catalog is Nov. 3o-Dec. 3.

ALL T:u:ESE facts are being exploited by the Communists in their attempt to convince the people of Asia that the \imperialistic\ United States seeks to impose slavery on Asia. Our unrealistic policies are thus losing us the support of the people we need. Support of thos\l unpopular governments has been pursued as a \practical\ measure to prevent the spread of communism. Actually however, it is the least practical measure; this policy has driven many A$iatic peoples to communism. · The United States has an eKcellent weapon in the propaganda war against communism. This weapon was provided for us by the Communists-it is the aggrespion of the North Korean Communists against South Korea. Armed with the facts, the United States has gained much support in Asia. And, in our defense of South Korea, we have demonstrated to Asia. and the world that we will not tolerate aggression anywhere. BUT PREVENTION of aggressiQn is not enough if it involves the support of unpopular governments. We must offer Asia a middle way. Not communism. Not facism. But a chance to organize a Demo- cratic, independent and representative government; a government which will reflect the ideals for which we are fighting.

And in the case of this rather ordinary sketch of family life in provincial Massachusetts about 1912, it is the acting that carries the piece de- spite a somewhat hackneyed and haphazard plot, a dramatization, we are told, of Miss Gordon's formative years.

4 Defe·cts in State GOP Not Obvious: Murphy EDITORIAL NOTE: This is the second of a series of political feat~res viewing tho Issues of the ~omlng state election. Prof. Murphy has run unsuccessfully on the Democratic tocket for Congress and his views do not necessarily reflect those of the Concordlensis. By Professor William M. Murphy The issues this year repeat those of 1948. Then ·in the nation, we had just endured two years of a Republic~n .Con- gress, and the people, tired of the experiment, returned to the Democrats. Now, in the State, we have endured eight years of a Republican Governor. The people seem ready once more to give the State back to the Democrats. BUT THE DEFECTS in the~•>---~---------­ State Republican government are s not so obvious and visible as those occer in the federal legislature in 1948. It Is hru:d to conceal inefficiency or corruption or reaction when it is nation-wide. But in New York State we have had a remarkable example of one-man government, in which the party boss is also the candidate. Under his iron control has been created and sustained the most z•emarkable political patron- age machine of modern times, beautifully disguised as an \effici- ent\ and hard-working \team.\ Those who have studied state fin- ances closely or followed the course of state legislation in the past eight years realized long ago that the Dewey administration has been the most expensive and the most backward that the State has known in thirty years. The HanleY letter h<>s merely confirmed what we always knew. that the little man with the big ideas will stop at nothing to have his way. The fruits of this dictatorship have been advertised widely, chief- ly through the State's Department of Commerce, where 600 full-time employees devote all their time to extolling the merits of the man who hires them. But what are some of those fruits? Let's take a brief look at only a few. COSTS: The costs of State Gov- ernment have risen 126% since 1942, when Gov. Lehman presented his last budget. This is much higher than the mcrease m gen- eral costs of living, and is higher than- the mcteaoe uf any uthcl large state. Y ct little ha~ been done with all this money. State aid to the localities (that is, the return by the state to municipalities of money that rightly belongs to them) has decreased tremendously, and cities and counties have been forced into financial crises as a result. The State Confe1·ence of Mayors, largely Republican, has gone on record to denounce the Governor's calculated r.cglect of localities. (Continued from Page 3) proved to be the winning marker. For insurance, Captain Eric Smith tallied in the second period on an- other setup by Loeber. Coach Gleich has been particu- larly pleased with the play of Bob Strunk, Don Bunce, and Fred Rap- ant, so far this year. Strunk has been valuable as a playmaker in the previous games, setting up sev- eral of the Union goals. Bunce, moved from a fullback position to center half, has been a tower of strength for the team. The coach thinks that sophomore Rapant is rapidly developing into an excel- lent soccer player. SYRACUSE will feature a power- ful offense and several potential All·American players. Spearhead- ing the forward wall will be Siggie Wirth, Steve Godoyal and Billy Nelson. Wirth has already been nominated for All-American hon- ors. The Orange goalie Bill Mul- haven is another standout, getting honorable mention on last year's All-American team. In past years Syracuse has been able to outrun the Garnet team; judging from re- ports of the team this year they will be in a position to try to out- z·un us again. If there is a weak- ness to be found in the visitor's team, It is in the defense. An ag- gressive Union forward wall might be nblr to g<'t past the fullbacks. ---oo-~- Physics Society to Meet The next meeting of the Physics Society will take place Wednesday, November 1, in Room 202 of the Physics Building.

TilE SliRPLL'S: Govemur Leh- Bridge Club Plans man left a fat wad of money to Dewey in 1942. During the years of the war, it was neither practical nor patriotic tu undertake public improvements, and the surplus soared above the half-billion mark. The existence of this fund helped to further the illusion that Dewey was a financia I v. izard. It also served as a good political advertise- ment during two presidential cam- paigns since it could be, and was, promised away variously. But after the fiasco of November, 1948, it gradually dwindled and disap- peared, being used to fill up the gaping holes in the last two State budgets. Dewey had his cake and ate it too, but it's giving him in- digestion. UNEl\'lPLOYM.ENT INS U R- ANCE. This fund, nobly conceived, has shown consistent surpluses every year. Dewey now annually redistributes the surplus among the employers. I DO NOT like to snub my col• league, Mr. Davis, but nothing he said last week requires an answer. In this Imperfect world, the so· ciologist cannot afford to disre- gard the politician if be wishes to be successful at his vocation: but the reverse is not true.
