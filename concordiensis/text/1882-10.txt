l . I i I l ' l ! t I l I 2 T'HE C!ONCORDIENSIS. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ MY DAUGHTER LOUISE. BY HOl\IER GREENE, '86. In the :light of the moon, by the side of the water, My ·seat on the sand and her seat on my knees, We watch the bright billows, do I and my daughte;r, My sweet little daughter Louise. We wonder what city the pathway of glory, That broadens away to the limitless west, Leads up to-she minds her of some pretty story And says: \ To the city that mortals love best.\ Then 1 say: \It must lead to the far awaycity, The beautiful City of Re.st.\ In the light of the moon, by the side of t:he water, Stand two in the shadow of whispering trees, And one loves my daughter, my beautiful daughter, My womanly danghter Louise. She steps to the boat with a touch of his fingers, And out on the diamond pathway they move; The shallop is lost in the distance, it lingers, It waits, but I know that its ·coming will prove That it went to the walls of the wonderful city, The magical City of Love. In the light of the moon, by the side of the water, I wait for her coming from over the seas; I wait but to welcome the dust of my daughter, To weep for my daughter Louise. The path, as of old, reaching out in its splendor, ·. . Glea~s bright, like a way that an angel has trod; I kiss the cold burdt:n its billows surrender, Sweet clay to lie under the pitiful sod; But she rests, at the end of the path, in the city, Whose\ builder and maker is God.\ -Ju1le Number tif Ottr C01ztine1zt. THE NEW SOUTH. BY JOS. E. RANSDELL. ~ LMOST from -the beginning ~ of our Union, the question ·of slavery has divided our country into a North and a ~.outh. There is no natural dividing line, no moun- tain range, no great river, 110 differ- ence of soil and climate; but south- ward slav~ry existed, northward it had been abolished in the day~ of our great grand-sire .. s. Why slavery continued in the South as a cruel thorn in the side of our Union is familiar to aH, and how it ~as finally overthrown is also well known. 1'he ·war of 186r-65 was a terrible fan1ily feud-a fight between brothers. Qne of them sank exhausted amidst shouts of freedonl from millions of new-made men ; the other arose from the strife, wounded, yet t,'i- umphant. Then carne times of trial and suf- fering to both brothers. The victor had not escaped unscathed. For him the war resulted in thousands of desolate hon1es and a terrible finan- cial panic. But the lot of the van- quished was hard, indeed. Slavery was the ground-work of the southern fabric of vvealth and social order, and when it fell every- thing had to be made anew. 'fhe ·untutored negro hardly knew the meaning of liberty, though \it \vas .very .sweet to him. · 'fhe master and slave had changed relations but were still friends. This condition did not .last long, however. The right of .suffrage being a necessary part of freedom, five millions of human be- ings, as ignorant of the rights and duties of voters as the babe unborn, were given full privileges of citizen- .ship in States they could t1nmeric_ally control.

Designing whites led the freedmen,. however, and every ... position of honor, trust and profit was soon in the hands of the negro party. Most of its white leaders were from the north. As a class they were restless, bold, unprincipled n1en-happy riddances to the com- munities they left and \scourges to the people they went among. I do not think the N-orth was responsible for their actions but at the time she got the credit of being their instiga- tor and abettor, but a perfect reign of terror was introduced through the agency of these men, and the ex- cessive measures of many fire-eating southerners, together with the uni- versal chaos arising fnnn the over- throw of slavery. It was negro against white, and of course the ne- gro had to )\ield save when pro- tected by federal troops. 'Thanks to the non-interference of President Hayes, however, negro and carpet bag misrule ended in the South six years ago. Then the land of Dixie seemed to awake from its frightful nightmare, and girding on the garments of wisdom and patriot- ism she strove once mo1·e to take her place in the nation. 'The struggle vvas hard for she had sunk to the ,, depths of distress, and many dark, many terribly on1inous clouds hov- ered over the horizon of effort and hope. Thank heaven, the clouds are now faint specks., and the horizon shines with the bright light of speed- ily assured success. And it is now, my friends, you have the opportunity to help us on our upward career. The South of to-day is not the South of ten years ago. w,e have restored order out of chaos; have established firm local governments ; have re- paired, in most cases, the enormous damages to property done by the war; have commenced to develop our vast, natural resources, and on all sides success sn1iles on our efforts. T'he political adventurer has gone .-never to return-and in his stead has come a small influx of go.od men fro1n the North bringing along with them•their frugal, industrious, honest habits. Moreover, . rnany southern students have sought learning as of old in northern colleges, and I be- lieve every one of them will echo tny words when I say they have received nothing but kindness, court- esy and genuine hospitality. If they are unfriendly when they come . hither that feeling is at once replaced by one of admiration for your won- derful cities, indus tries and schools, and soon the ties of loving friendship and gratitnde bind the southern stu- dent to his northern college home. These facts, together \Vith the rapidly increasing exchange of visit ... ors, have very n1aterially altered the

4 THE CONCORDI.ENSIS. feelings of each section towards the other. Within the past six years millions of northern capital has been invested in the South and is paying largely. Northern men who have gone South in that period have been welcomed warn1ly, and many others ar:e earnestly invited. We want northet.n n1en! We want your ener.-. gy, your industry, your capital to dra\v out our rich but undeveloped resources. We want your help to found our schools, educate our peo- ple, black and white, make educa- tion as universal and thorough among us as in your own enlightened states. 1'hese wants of the South are not utterly selfish. She will reward all who minister to them. Her agricul- tural resources are rich as the Nile, and practically l~mi tless. Her peo- ple engaged in agriculture in unfav- orable circumstances are prospering. And why cannot no~thcrn men, \vith their skill, their improved imple- ments and their ready capital pros- per faster? Believe me, friends-, they can and will prosper. When your young n1en and women grow restless and long for homes in new lands send \hem to the South instead of the West. The South is as much a new country to-day as the West, for her old civilization and sys- tems are broken 'down,. and on their ruin~ are arising new systems, new civilization, new people. Come then, my friends, and help us create these new systems, civilization and people. You will not be going to a strange land. .We are one people, the san1e proud Saxon and Celtic blood courses through our veins. Our fathers fought and bled side by side to make this Union, side by side to protect it in 1812, side by side to vindicate its rights in ·'45 and '46; and shall we, because of an unhappy feud, which, God .be praised, exists only in the darkening gloon1 of Jl1e past, refuse to each other our protection and love ? No ! we \vill not refuse them. The vanquished have ac- cepted the issue of war. The glori- ous Union rolls on as warmly be- loved by the South as by the North. By North and South, say I! There is no longer a North, no lo11ger a South. \Ve are the grand American Republic ! Past differences have all been swept away with their cause and curse slavery, and the United States to-day, twenty years after the greatest civil \var the world has ever seen, stands foremost among the na- tions of the earth, and glories in the literal and figurative truth of its motto, ~Tn£ted 'ZVe stalld, dz'vz'ded we fall. -The University of Berlin has ·over 4,000 students.

Everybody is welcome and we sincerely hope that many students ·will embrace the opportuni- ty to look over the history of our country in a scholarly and profitable way. r·Nr>- @NE thing is very evident, and \'V~\Y' that is that class politics are playing a too in1portant part in the college. One of the classes .met and had to adjourn on account of a tie-in which neither party would give in to the other. Another held • a class meeting in which parliamen- tary, yes, even gentlen1anly usage was forgotten, and in still another a league was formed to gobble up all the principal offices. We have no comments at present, but certainly an outside spectator would be dis- gusted at this ill-natured scram.ble for petty offices. ~OW as we are beginning a new }t)~ year we advise the incoming n1en and those who are not already members, to join one of the literary societies. Every graduate will bear witness to their benefit. 1~hey not only instruct .i'n parliamentary usage but also develop the speaking facul- ties. The .t\delphic and Philomath- ean are societies to belong to which is an honor. They are older than the majority of colleges and the long l:ist of noted men, each has grad- uated, is its best re-comm·endation. To every non-member we would say, .. join one or the other of these socie- ties, and perfonn its duties zealously and you will some day admit that you could l)a ve spared any other part of your college training with less cl e trim ent. .E are able to chronicle an im- ~ provement in the Engineer-· ing Course, by reason of which the Freshtnen are taught how to handle the instruments at an early date.

How cruel were our friends in relating stories of midnight interviews of the terrible J)elto Q. society that initia- ted by the aid of the pump or blanket, with perhaps a mock burial at the end that was fearfully real to the occu- pant of the \two by six.\ We never enjoyed such an ordeal. In fact we are glad that reminiscences ·and the dim shadow of a monstrous evil were all that rr~mained of this notorious society. It rna y have been necessary to • use harsh n1eans to reduce the F'reshn1an's conceit and \teach him . to his place \ as it was considered necessary to hang fort heft, but those days have passed away. Politeness and due respect for s-uperiors are now taught at preparatory schools, and no one who has passed the en- trance ordeal can be so obttise as not to recognize superiority where it exists. We congratulate our col- lege on the change. Treat the ~--reshmen as men and no evil wi.l1 come of it. ,@N the Hill some change has .--u~'-\\' been made during the sum- n1er, though not as great as we had hoped to see. The Washburne Memorial is now inclosed, and when completed will be an ornament to our campus and to a limited extent supply a pressing need. It is in striking contrast to the other build- ings. We are greatly in need of ' n1odern improvements, but it secn1s / to us that the plan of the new build- ing is just a step or two too far re- moved from the plain utility that has been customary . . The older buildings should be re- paired and modern improveinents added. We believe the matter is under consideration and all that de- lays the change is the want of funds. It would be wise to expend the mo- ney now being laid out on carving, colun1ns and other ornaments in this way. The nf·w building is an ele- gant structure but we think orna- ment has been considered more than utility. We wait in1patiently for the two dormitories that are to~ flank the \\lashburne on either~side. Would that some one weary of careing for the filthy ]ucre n1ight give a few thousands to erect the mtlch desired buildings. ~ ~ T is to be regretcd that the &\\) chapel choir has disbanded. Last year chapel seemed like a devotional service. It was the exception to see books open during service. Let us not fall back into the ruts of other . years. Let the instrument be re- stored, the choir re-organized and the books closed. ..

THE CONCO'RDIENSlS. ----------~~---. Last year there was a general de- sire that our \nine\ might meet some of the eastern college ·clubs, but the shortness of the spring sea- son prevented. Except the tnem- bers from '82 the men are back and '86 has brought sotne re--inforcement, therefore the nine should be organ- . ' ized with a view to joining the east- ern association. 1'he many compli- ments our men earned last season sanction such action. Our associa- tion should provide some finance scheme that may insure the desired games. MILITARY PRIZES AWARDED AT COM- MENCEMENT IN JUNE, I 882.

For a long time the CoN- CORDIENsrs has been urging the ne- cessity of this and we rejoice to see that its efforts have not been in vain. We see no reason why Union should not have a team that can excite the admiration of the best. She has plenty of strong- men and fleet run- ners, and practice is all they need. It is a new game to the greater part of us and we shou!d, on that account, ,meet more often in practice games to learn the rules and manner of playing, and perhaps to n1eet ot?er colleges. Some offer the objection that it would take away all interest in base ball. This is not so, for there a~e plenty here who do not care for base· ball, but take the great- est interest in foot ball. The few practi<;e games we have had show both the interest and ability of _the players. We would, therefore, urge all who are interested in this game to participate in the gan1es on the campus. \ In the Yates cup championship garnes for the year ending June, I 882, the class of '8 5 won the cup after a succession of easy victories over the other classes. The order in which tl~e classes stood, accot:d- ing to the nurn ber of games won is as follows: '8 5 first, '84 second, '83 third and '82 fourth. The cup on which is inscribed the winning class and the year it is won, will be placed in ·the library~ This year the inscription reads, \\von by the class of I 88 5 in the year I 882.,\ and in all probability, it \vill not be changed n1uch during the three suc- ceeding years.

On the other hand, '86, although the smallest class, has been generous enough to furnish a ball without being requested. 'Rah for '86. In looking over the \ gyn1,\ we notice that the apparatus is fast be- ing destroyed by the hands of care- less and inexperienced persons. It is bad enough not to have a con1pe- tent physical instructor-as Dr. Sar- geant of Harvard. for instanc~-but not to have any one to take care of the apparatus we possess is infinitely worse. We hope the authorities will give this immediate attention, for with the outlay of a few dollars, our gyn1nasiun1 could be rnade all that is desired.

---'Ched:, which will be given on Wednesday evening is one .of the latest and best of the many plays written by Mr. fred l\Iarsden, whose Zip, Bob and J5-erry Gow .are perh~p s better known than any others from his pen. It ts essential- ly an American comedy of pure moral . and fr!'!e from all of the objectionable features. often found tn plays adapted or translated from foreign sources, The story is a si~ple ?ne. A Virginian of wealth and refinement wro';lgfully u;na,g.Ined that his wife is not the proper person to br!Ilg up his mfant son, and he takes the child from he:r and gives it to a wo- man in New York to care for, senduig her large sums of money to pay for the .child's maintenanc<? and educ;:atio~. He finally dtscovers his error and on sendmg to r~clatm h1:s child can find no trace of the boy, the woman havmg betray- ed her trust and concealed herself from him. The boy who does not know his own name has. in the meantime grown up as a New York street waif and. has succeded in gaining enough of an education to obtain a footing in the outer ci~­ cles of journalism and when the actiOn of the play opens lS one of the condu:::tors of an irresponsible paper called \The New York Anti.\ The father in his search for his son is imposed upon by a villain who personates the missing young man so successfully as to be acknowledged as that person. The imposition is suddenly exposed to the father, who drops dead from heart disea~e when he becomes convinced of the fact. The false heir obtains possession of the property, and to compel a young girl, who is a menace to his undisturbed enjoyment of the same, is about to perpetrate an act ofcntel wrong upon her guardian. \ Dick,\ the \ Bohemian,\ who is aware of the imposture, but does not suspect th'at :he is personally interested, has in the meantime met Nell, the girl in question, and fallen in love with her. Her influence has worked a change in his ideas of right and wrong, and he is determined to give up all of his irregularities, bec0me a man, and do his share in foiling the rascal. In this, of .course, he is successful, and no one is more surprised than he when the result of his efforts in behalf of the girl is to win for himself wife, name and fortune. The scene of the pb.y i; partly in Vir:?;inia and partly in New York, the com- ic element is hrgely in the ascendant, and the part of Dic'k., which w.:ts e3pecially written for l\'lr. Reed, gives hiiU . abundant opportunity for showing many phases of his ka- l•!idoscopic ver.51.tility ·of cl.aracter. His songs are a natu- ral part of the play, and are not introduced as specialties, while the jokes, witticisms, peculiar gestures, and mirth- provoking ide::ts of Dick are just such as one would expect fwm a young man who has fcught his way up through the sub.;trat.t of New York society. That Mr. Reed is bril- liantly successful in interpreting this peculiarly eccentric c.]ara·.-:ter ts the uiliversal verdict of the press in the cities whct'e he ha-> presented it. ·~$Jierconetlo.
