The pencil wot·ks fine. 1 havl:! nevet· used a repeater before and I greatly appreciate your letting me bonow it. But remember, I only asked to borrow it for a half hour or so. I had no intentions of keeping it. I don't think that even the sophomore dis- cipline committee would keep your personal property. And, fellow, the power of the press does not give us any special rights to keep things that don't belong to us_ This pencil has really got me worried be- cause maybe you haven't picked it up because you are scared of me. If this is so, just tell Betty down in Mr. Ketz' office and I'll let her give it to you so you won't have to look at me ag·ain. Yours confusedly, The editor Freshman Camp Karl Koch and Bill Ketz ran what we think is the best freshman camp in the history of the .college this year and we want to let them !mow about it. The most important thing that happened at camp, and something that we are not sure the two men are conscious of, is that a mood was set which well could carry through the whole year at school. The mood was one of cooperation among all pe1·sonnel, students faculty, administration. It was highlighted by ,:;~ontaneous songfests, informality, and a willmgness by everyone to do a little extra. There was no one who went out of his way. to be conspicuous, there was no one who questioned the intentions of another. As a result, more was accomplished quicker than we have ever seen before> SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 24. Football. Union vs. St. Lawrence at Canton, 2 p.m. SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 25. Sunday Service. Preacher.

Since they are merely \temporary structures\ it is understandable that the administt·a- tion has been unwilling to spend huge sums of money in making them more habitable. Howevet·, there are a few things that can be done without incurring any prohibitive expenses. Some of the mattresses (especially those under two inches thicltl could ·be replaced; many of the cots are missing slats under the springs, and I dc·n't believe they cost much. over $.15 apiece. The floor boards have separated and the dirt that accumulates between them becomes a muddy mess when the floors are mopped. On good coat of paint would really help. How about a simple partifion between the wash bowls and the tC>ilet bowls? It isn't very pleasant to brush one's teeth while someone next to you is performing a more necessary act of ·nature. Even the army eliminated this unpleasantness by putting up a wall between. As a last suggestion, I think that the weeds should be allowed to g,row until they completely cover these blots on c·ur otherwise pleasant campus. Incidentally, while waiting for some results, even if it's only comments, could we possibly have some heat?

While ~·ou play away this week and won't be abl€ to see or hea1· us, we will be rooting for yC>u. And win, lose, OJ' draw, ~·ou'll hear us cheering you next week at the first home game. Good luck, fellow~. ~ Scared? Dear freshman, If y·ou a1·e the one who lent your repeater pencil to me last week while vou were in line to have your picture taken, 'this notE' is ad- dressed to you. The pencil works fine. I hnve never used a repeater before and I greatly app1·eciate your letting me borrow it. Ilut remember, I only asked to botTO\V it fo1· a half hom· or so. I had no intentions of keeping it. I don't think that even the soplwmore dis- cipline committE'e would keep your personal prope1'ty. And, fellow, the power of the press does not give us any special rig·hts to keep thing-s that don't belong to us. This pencil has really got me worried lle- cause maybe you haven't picked it up because you an scared of me. If this is so, just tell Betty down in :\Ir. Ketz' office and I'll let her g-ive it to vou so \'OU won't have to look at n1e again. · · Your~ con fuseclly, The ectitoi' Freshman Camp Karl Koch and Bill Ketz ran what we thinl< is the best freshman car'np in the histoi'V of the cC>llege this year and we want to let them know about it. The most important thing that happened at camp, and something that we are not sure the two men are conscious of, is that a mood was s€t which well could cm·n· through the whole year at school. The mood was one of cooperation among all personnel. students, faculty, administration. It was highlighted by spontaneous songfests, informalitv and a willingness by eve1·yone to do a little. ~xtra. The1·e was no one who went out of his wav to be conspicuous, there was no one wh'o questioned the intentions of another. As a result, more was accomplh:;hed quiC'ker than we have ever seen before. Why can't we carry this spirit of cooper- ation and informality right into student o·ov- ernment and into the laps of the facultv band administration? Why can't we get tog:ether and talk.over issues which seem complicated? Why can't we look upon the permanent mem\ bel'S C>f the college (faculty, administration) as somewhat less than mean men, and go to them with problems in which thev are in- volved? Why can't we have a united stu- dent body doing· everything possible to make the co1lege a better one? The answm· is that we can.

Among the aspirants are several fine high school bacll:field men, led by Johnny Shade, star passer of la~t year's _undefeated Lansingburg High eleven.

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1949 v u f'-1 Cl-l q -~D Garnet Hill a.nd Dalers Hurt by Heavy Losses ---------4: BENCH BLISTERS 'L-By JIM ETTINGER=; Once again tomono.v on college can.puse~ throughout the country whistles wiU blow, bands v. ill play, and crov.ds v.iH sing and cheer at the traditicnul s,:ectacle of men· grappling, groping, shoving, a·nd · pushing ·en n asse over an oval shaped object lmo\ n as a football. On the Union 1•amp.us all atten- tion will be fot•used northl'l ard to- wards thP little 1o\1Jl of ·Canton where eleven Searl'et ~aints of St. Lawrence University will ·be seel~­ ing revenge o\·er a lu•yed UIJ and vicfory minded Garnet football squad. By all tlhe pre-sl'asun dope available :St. LaVIrenct• is expected to be one of the n:ost formidable teams on the schedule, and the game has bE'em coiH'E'ded to be a toss up. Coach John McLaughry has stated that the team that gets the breaks may be expected to emerge victorious. The breaks may very readily decide football garr.es, but another criterion which io; probably mole important is training and cc·nditioning-. As far as the Union team is concerned they have had the best possible under· the able mentorship of McLaughry and his staff of Art Lawrence, Pete Nistad. and T.any Rocco. There is one thing that we can be assw,ed of, and that is that no tea.m. is going to gain much ~·ardage through the rugge·d Gal'Ilet line, which is deep in reserve sh·ength and averages about 192 lbs. . . This was very much in evidence in the practice sHimmage held at Am- herst last wee!>. Amherst's 1 unning play of the day was a ground gaining sweep around the· ends performed by a light, shifty back who was able to get as far as he did mcstly because of his speed and deception. Prac- tically every play directed at the Union line v. as turned back with little gain. Despite the unofficial 28-14 score in favor of Amherst, we would say that both teams were very evenly matched. Co-Captain Dave Strauss passed on the first play of the scrimmage to Dick Speidel for a touchdown, and for ·the remainder of the contest was used mainly on defense, at which he is wealwst. This points cut the fact that Coach McLaughry was trying to strengthen his weak points and not trying to run up a score. Offensively the McLaughrymen are po'l.verful, to put it mildly, and the attack has exceptional balance. We should not be at all pessimistic about a victory over the Larries tomorrow. ---o--- Managers Wanted Having lost his top four 1·unners, Coach BiB Ketz is faced with the task of completely rebuilding his ct·o><s-country squad, and hopes for a secrmd consecutive undefeatf'd seao;on are dim. LOST THROUGH graduation .are Bob Garlock, Newt Culver, and Ray Bellanger. Captair.-elect Don Wright has left scho>Cl. Ketz will bui'ld his squad around Abe La!{• shin ? nd Townsend McCoun, the two returning veterans from 1948. Advancing from last year's fresh- man team are at least six men.· Arnie Nirdlinger, Alex McCormick, and Dave Brown are the m0st outstanding sophomores. THE ONE bright spot in this picture is the promisi·ng group of freshmen. Ketz's .principal hopes are pinned on the future because the rugged schedule in prc•spect for this season does not bode wen for a successful year. The harriers have been working out for a week now and the cam- paign opens agai·nst Vermont, October 8, on Alexander Field. CHEERED BY bright prospects• Coach Bill Ketz began work Tues- day afternoon with his freshman cross country hopefuls-approxi- mately 12 in number. Coach Ketz likes the general appearance of the squad, rating it better than last year's. Most promising man working out with the frosh harriers is Dick Dolan, who is the most talented runne1· that Coach Ketz has in- herited in his 19 years here, on· the basis of past records. Polan ran the mile in 4:31.9 f{)r Glens Falls High and finished fourth in the big Grout Memorial Cross Country Run here in Schenectady last fall. Bob Murray and John Larkin are the men whom Coach Ketz expects to give Dolan the keenest competi- tion. However, Ketz is mindful of the fact that he. can only rate his men, at this time, on the basis of past times and that he knows nc·thing of the men who have never run before or who have run only short distances. Murray has a very fluid stride; Larkin's best point is his stamina. KETZ'S PROBLEM now is to find four men able to back up his first three men. His chances should be quite good. here, too. Bob Kline has good experience and Jan Walker, who is no<t yet in: shape, should do well. An excellent quarter miler who has never run over a half mile is John Pape. He may well .be one of those \sleepers\ which Ketz tries to find each year. 0, __ _ Tony Rocco Joins Garnet Coach Staff Members of the S.aphomore olass who are desirous of competing for the .Fall Varsity sports managerial positions are requested to report to the Director of Athletics at once. Tony Rocco of Schenectady has been named to round out the '49 edition; ·C<f Union's football brain trust which already includes head coach John McLaughry and as- sistants Art Lawrence and Pete Nistad. The former Cansius Col- lege of Buffalo player succeeds George Rusch who was aptJointed earlier this year but was forced to resign because of business duties. ROCCO, who is twenty-four years old, began his football ef- forts at Nc•tt Terrace High School. His college career includes a. year at Notre Dame in addition to his stay at Canisius. While at the latter school, the six foot, 190 poundet• quarterbacked the \T\ for two years. Since he is slated to assume the role of backfield mentor, Rocco's experience is ex- pected to stand him in gc'lld stead as he g,uides the backs in Me~ Laughry's \Winged-T\ system.

Well, these guys come in so fast we run out of markers, so RPI Relations The board of managers took action Tues- day night guaranteeing the activ~ties would take no part in any pre-game. r1valt:Y fuss with RPI. It is the part of pass1ve reststance and seems to us most commendable. The idea is just to avoid making the preparations which have bee~ made other years, locking the gate~, post11:1g guards etc. This includes not havmg radiO patrols out and cars cruising around the streets looking for trouble because of the danger of such operations. It was a miracle that no one was hurt last year. If any RPI men come here, let them do their damage. All we have to do is slap a bill on their president's desk the next day for damage done and it will cease sQon enough. The only point we must be sure of is that no Union men are over doing damage to their campus. That wi!ekend will be a big one for RPI. It is the 125th anniversary of their founding and they plan a big celebration, with important people scheduled to be on campus. It would certainly give Union a bad .name if we marred their campus and spoiled this big occasion for them with childish actions. Some suggestions have been made to pre- vent certain segments of the student body from planning :raids. One is that the sopho- more discipline committee make a ruling that no freshmen can go off campus that night and have bed checks to see that the rule is enforced. Another is that each school send seve1·al representatives to the other's campus to identify any offenders. All the Union men would need to do is get the names of the men involved so that the student coun- cil could enforce the ruling ~which they laid down on Dec. 7, 1948 which says, in part, \that students caught committing· acts of vandalism on rival college campuses be rec- ommended to the dean for dismissal,\ and goes on to recommend that the administra- tion threaten severance of relations with any college whose students are found here. We don't want to see the rivalry discon- tinued because it can be a fine. sportsman- like competition. We think the board of managers has made a fine initial step with the passive resistance idea. How about it student council and sophomore discipline committee? Are you willing to carry the idea a step further? --------0-------- MONDAY, OCT. 3. Assembly, board of managers, M.

He went on to relate that some time recently-last ~pring, he admitted. upon q'l\<!Stioning-one of the boys in the Psi Upsilon house had without permission moved his dresser and desk around in his room. When the alumni inspector went through the house on his monthly visit, he noted the change in the furniture arrangemen.t and left a note requesting the fellow to move the desk and dresser back the way they were and Jea.ve them that way. Nothing was d·c•ne. The next month, on his visit to the house, tQe alumni inspector again noted that the furniture was not \according to plan\ in one of the second floor bed t;ooms. And the in- spector left another note ordering the brother to change his furnltul'e to the original setup.

Brud Shaffer, 5 ft. 11 in., Union guard, was the outstanding lineman in last Saturday's battle with St. Lawrence, in the ·opinion of the personnel of the press box. Brud recovered a St. Lawt·ence fumble early in the third quarter to halt a Lat rie drive, and was a thom in the side of St. Lawrence 1.Al aftermwn. Brud, a marine vet- ••tan, teamed up with Pete Ten Eyck last season to give Union one of the .best pat-r of guard:> seen on the hill in many a day. BRUD, the father of three sons, was ra-ted as one of the best guards in the history of Nott Terrace high school. He is a member of Beta Theta Pi ft·atcrrtity.

Almost every college, large or small, conducts four to eight weeks of spring prac- tice for the purpose of teaching fundamentals and finding out who has the ability and who hasn't. Hence, at Union, some 50 candi- dates took part in four weeks prac- tice last Spt•ing. Freshmen w.ere required to at- tend as well as all upper classmen. During this time, the offense, as you will see it this fall, was taught and new variations were ex peri-· mented with. In the fall, early practice with two sessions a day of two and a half hours time, each of concentrated worlt, is required to bring the team up to game form., in less than three weeks. This, plus an hour of \skull\ practice is nec- essary fox· the first weeks. FOOTBALL is not entirely a game of brawn by any means and it takes a lot of thought and com- mon sense to assimilate the great amount of material necessary for play in a modern offense and de- fense. It might be added that sev- eral members of the faculty at- tended a \skull\ session one eve- ning last year.

But believe me, Buster, when I don't like some- one I don't like them.\ She likes the fishing season best.

As a matter of fact, she's in the process of making onP now. A native of Schenectady, Mr!' Sheehy has traveled over most of the country, as far south as Flor- ida and west as California. But she has never been out of the country. \Oh Lord no, they'd nevPr let me back. Over at Ellis Island they'd says \where'd you come from?' •·. Her son would be 20 now, 1f he were alive and would be here at Union studying. He was killed in an automobile accident at the a~e of 9. Mrs. Sheehy does have a daugh- ter living who recently made her a grandmother <the baby's a year old). Her eyes light up when she says, \Some women wouldn't want it known that they were old enoug-h to be a grandmother but I'm very proud of it.\ SHE AND DAISY were talkmg the other day and they both believe Lhat Washburn Hall Is the nicPst looking building on campus, no matter what angle you approach it from, \and It's not JUst because I work there either.\ Whereas the matron used to eat her lunch In the Mountebanks every day when the place was dirty, she has no place now becausE' the green room which was com- pleted last spring Is too nice.

I don't know what klrnl of homes they come from but they still all treat the women fine. · 'l'he people in WashbUtn Hall got together last Christmas and bought Mrs. Sheehy a gift. It was the first time that any matron at Washburn received such a Christmas gift. The Jad1es m the bookstore, the p~ople m Bill Ketz\ office, the boys on the Conco1 dy and in the radio station all cont11buted.

A supple- mentary curriculum, V-1, was es- tablished in April to prepare fresh- men and sophomores for V-7. Re- quilements for admittance to either of these programs were then tightened, only the highest rank- ing men passing a rigorous V-1 curriculum centering on. mathema- tics. physics, and physical training being accepted into V17. The V-1 and V-7 programs were replaced early in 1943 by the more cornprllhensive V-12 and V·5. The latter provided preliminary train- ing for aViation cadets and was abolished in 1944. V·12 at its height contained 500 men, including 300 taking the basic officer training course, 150 engineering, and 50 pre- medical instruction. The trainees were housed m North and South Colleges and the campus fraternity houses, which were temporarily ap- proriated by the college. The per- manent commanders of the unit, from its inception to its disband- ment in July, 1946, were Lt. Comdrs. M. L. Horner, F. B. An- dreen, and Oliver Evans, succes- sively. There was some considera- tion given in 1946 to replacing V-12 by an ,NROTC unit, but the size of the college plant \\as concluded to be inadequate. ---o,--- Complete Training Anthony Fiaco and James A.
