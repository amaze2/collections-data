'' T h , f l e a ways: e ,1eves you. ·,. e sou1 o trut1 appealing to one side of n1an's nature de- signed especially to stimulate a devotional spirit at set times and in properly consecrated himself he expected it, inspired it. Believing as he did, being what he was, Thomas Arnold becan1e a positive force in the larger \vorld of ideas and activities. He -vvas under an in\vard compulsion to give his best thought to the solution ,of the problems , of his times, religious, civil, social. It is com- mon for us to n1ake this distinction, but in its essence it is arbitrary and superficial. To such a ln.tnd, to such a nature as Arnold's ' every pro bl.em is a religious problem, or n1ore accurate[y a problen1 in religion. Religion is truth, and truth is indivisible though many sided. It was impossible f~r hin1 to be a mere theologian in the technical sense, it was equally irtlpossible fer him to be anything but a theologian in the broad sense, that the science of God is the one all comprehensive science including everything that is true in . th0ught, true in fact and righteous in life. Whatever is trtle is essentially divine, an ex- pression of the all ernbracing, all anin1ating ·places; a thing of n1ysteries; a piece of mechanism adapted to the salvation of the soul as a separate something in man, a kind of prisoner of the flesh, an exile \vaiting to be called home. A r,eligious man was one who accepted certain propositions about the Bible and certain other propositions evolved from the Bible, who prayed, sang hymns, gave ahns, and talked \vell. The conflicting currents of thought early in the century, represented by the Evangelical and Anglo-Catholic schools, did not sweep beyond the ,conventional boundaries of a prescribed area and imn1erse the whole life of man with purifying energy. It was Arnold's Vv'ork preeminently to obliter- ate the old land marks and give new di~ec­ tion, new scope to religious virtue. With him redemption\vas son1ething involving all human interests. The soul \vas man in all his con- scious being. God \vas to· be glorified in offices, and shops, and council chambers, and legislative halls, as truly as in cathedrals. He took religion out of doors, i. e. out of church doors, to be nourished by the clear Truth. It was a profound conviction of this \vhich inspired Arnold's tnore public life. Every subject of hurnan inquiry was charged \iVith holy mea11ing and n1nst be approached rever- ently, ,must be discussed without thought of personal consequence, with the single ain1 to find the eternal principle lying deep within- the hidden life of God ~which tnust be made manifest for righteousness sake. I d\vell upon this because it seen1s to tne the most distinctive influence \vhich Arnold introduced into current discussions. Just as in school he put religious sanctity into every exercise- play, study, rest- so in the larger life of the \vorld he clothed all relationships, all duties, all pleasures, \~Jith practical holiness. This \Vas a tren1endous advance upon the old rnethod s of Christian thought-. not that such a theory was unknown before indeed, it had always been a beautiful theory in the church, but little n1ore than a theory. Practically, religion. was only one departn1ent of study ~~ light and the pure air of heaven. And lo, this tnade him a heretic. Ecclesiastics of every school named hin1 'an enemy. Hovv could religion live on the other side of stained glass, beyond the droppings of the sanctuary, withdrawn frotn the influence of enshrined dogmatism. For a time he was the best abused n1an in England. I \vould not seen1 to imply that Arnold ignored the ministries of the place of \vorship. On the contrary the church was the soul's earthly hon1e. He only insisted that it \vas not also its place of busi- ness; or better perhaps, the church was the inner chamber, the place for special devotional retirernent while the whole world was God's house. lie has been called the most truly religious rnan of the cent_ury, and yet such an one as Newman in a passionate moment asked, \Is Arnold a Christian?''

I had the unpleasant task, the last three years I was in college, of raising the large part of the money which was subscribed by the alumni, and so can readHy appreciate the difficulties which the present management experiences. It is entirely wrong for the n1en in college to shirk this matter in the vvay they do. Union ,College is this season represented in the foot ball field by one of the best elevens that has ever worn the garnet, and this should not only touch the pride of all Union men, but it should also touch their pocket books.

The students have no. right to expect the alumni of Old Union to support t!zeir athletic» unless they support then1 as well. I have heard the argument used that a tnan would not subscribe because there were to be only three or four games on the campus. This objection should not be given any validity by any man in college, because the money which you give to the support of your foot ball tP.am should not be paid over to the management in the same spirit as is the money of the spectator, whose only interest is to see a foot ball gatne, and I should sincerely hope that the interest of every man in Union College goes a great deal farther than the mere seeing of three or four games.

THE CONCORDlENSIS desires, in the nan1e of the students, to thank the faculty for giving us a \bolt'' last N[onday. T'he prompt action of President Webster in apprehending the person who has been per- forming slight of lland tricks in the gymna- sium \vith the contents of the pockets of the foot ball n1en, is very comn1endable.

The Johnstown correspondent of the Al-l bany Evening :Journal n1ade some false and very erroneous staternents in his report of the game between the J ohnstovvn team and our second eleven. None of our men played under assumed nan1es and no tnember of the 'varsity played with the second eleven, in fact no member of the regular eleven attended the game. The work of our foot ball team is certainly very encouraging. The tnen are covering . ~ themselves with glory and there is no reason \vhy that pennant should not come to Union. The defeat of Ridgefield and the scores in the Crescent and West Point games are very good indications of the strength of the team, and our interference was acknowledged by .. The students are all talking about the Union-Dartmouth game to be played on the West Troy grounds Thanksgiving day. Of course everybody is interested and hopes that Union will win. But hoping will not accotn- plish the desired result. What is needed is the presence of the Union n1en in a body at that gan1e, to yell for and encourage the tean1. The n1en turned out vvell at the Union-Ridgefield game and \Ve all knovv the result. It is the duty of every man in col- lege to go over and see the game, and vve urge each man not to go home be(ore the game but see the gan1e first and then take a train for his hon1e, conscious that he has done his duty in -supporting his college team by his personal presence .

THE CONCORDIENSIS. Il UNION, '24; RIDGEFIEL'D, 0. The Union College eleven and substitutes, with Manager Cooke, Captain ·Gregory, and Dr. Linhart, and over one hundred tin-lunged backers of the garnet, swooped do\vn upon Albany on October 26, and \vitnessed the first defeat of the Ridgefield eleven by a Union teatn on the b.eautiful oval of the Ridgefield Athletic· Club. In the words of a local newspaper, '' Union turned the tahles and the rest of the household furniture when she administered to Ridgefield a dose of her own medicine- and before such an attend- ance!'' The day was charming, and over r ,ooo peo- ple crowded around the side lines to witness the struggle. The nun1erous buggies, landaus, \Vagons, carts, sn1art rigs of all sorts, horsen1 en on restless 1nounts added life to the scene. No cotnparison of the contesting elevens is possible, Ridgefield \vas sin1ply out-played at every point. In bucking the line, in making gains around the ends, jn interference and in general teatn \vork as ·well as in the knowledge of the scientific points of the gan1e Ridgefield \Vas out-classed. The story of the victory is soon told.

The Cres-· cents then gained through the center and around the ends and another fierce struggle \vas enacted on Union's five-yard line. After several vain a tten1 pts to go through the Union center, Sheldon went around the right end for the last touch down and Pratt kicked a goal. Score: Crescents, 20; Union, 8.

) THE CoNCORDIENsts. VoL. XVIL UNION COLLEGE, NOVEMBER 22, 1893. No. 5· HENRY w·HtTE CANNON. Henry White Cannon was born in De'lhi, Dela\vare county, .New York, Septetnher 2 ;th, • 1850. He is a direct descendant on his · mother's side, frotn the first white child born in New England. I-fe attended the private ; schools of his native town, and supplen1ented : the excellent elementary education received therein, by study in the Delaware Literary Institute. Electing the pursuit of banking for the oc- cupation of cotning years, he entered as clerk in the First National bank of Delhi, N. Y., C;\nd, before the age of twenty, he became teller. Banking ·was that fonn of scientifi.c associated enterprise, for \vhich the genius of young ·Cannon had u 11\vonted strong affinities, and desiring a larger field in which to exer- cise his talent, he removed in 1870 to the West and accepted a position in the Second National bank of St. Paul, .Minn. In the fol- lowing year he resigned his position and remo\·ed to Stillwater, Minn. Here in I 87 [, being but twenty-one years uf age, he organ- ized the Lumberman's National bank, and for thirteen years was its cashier and active managing officer. T\vo years after the organization of the bank, the panic of 187 3 caused the suspension of currency payments of many banking insti- tutions in Minnesota and throughout the country, while Henry W. Cannon brotJght his bank through, paying all demands in currencv . . In May, 1884, at the earnest solicitation of the congressional delegation from his adopted state, and by the principal bankers in New York and Chicago, Henry W. Cannon \vas appointed by President Chester l\.. Arthur, con1ptroller of currency, to succeed Hon. John Jay Knox, vv ho vvas one of the most able n1en that ever filled the position. The appointrnent was not n1ade on political grounds, although Henry \V. Cannon \vas an ·earnest and active member of the Republican party, and his selection to succeed Comp- troller Knox, ·was a high tribute to his n1ental and moral w.orth, and for a n1an of his years, something extraordinary, but we must take . into consideration that Mr. Cannon's whole life, from the time of his leaving school in his native to\vn, had been one of preparation for just such a position as be was no'v called upon to fill. A n1aster of banking in all its .. complex details, and a close student for years of all the best \vorks on pol}tical economy, banking and commercial la\v, he was there- fore \vell fitted to undertake to adn1inister the duties pertaining to the office of comp- troller of currency. He had the friendship and best 'vishes of Comptroller Knox in his arduous duties. The financial crisis of 1884- began the sa1ne month that Mr. Cannon entered upon the duties of his office as Con1ptroller. It vvas general and extended throughout the country, exposing \veakness in rnany places; defalca- tions in large numbers ·were found and more Receivers were appointed d ur[ng that year than any other in the history of the Cotnp- troller's office ;. these Receivers \Vere all ap- pointed by Mr. Cannon, and extraordinary labors \vere thro\vn upon the Comptroller's office; a number of extra bank examiners '\ere ernployed and, in many instances, by the prompt action of lVIr. Cannon, ba~ks that otherwise might have suspended and gone into the hands of Receivers, were undoubtedly saved by his timely action and practical knowledge of banking. During this panic a resolution was intro- duced in the United States Senate, request ...

4 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ing Cotnptroller ,Cannon to appear before tJle Finance Comtnittee and report upon the con- · clition of the banks in Nevv York city, \v'here it \vas alleged that, as the Clearing House had discontinued making \veekly reports, the : banks were in a precarious condition and that extraordinary measures should be used. The following Senators \vere rnen1bers of that committee: Morrill, Shern1an, Bayard, Beck, Aldrick and others. Comptroller ~can non made report to this commit tee, showing that he \Vas fully informed as to condition of affairs in New York, and advised that no un- necessary publicity be given to their condi- tion, and he fully convinced the committee. that the banks \vere daily increasing their cash reserves and that it was not necessary to resort to legislation or extraordinary measures. Mr. Cannon's action in this nlat- ter \vas undoubtedly of great service to the banks and the country. His relations as Comptroller to the chainnan and members of the Clearing House Com n1ittee were close and cordial. The corporate existence of 97 I National banks, representing a ca.pital of over $270,- ooo,ooo, expired during Mr. Cannon's term of office. The Act of July 12th, I88z, under which Comptro:ller Cannon's reports for 1884 and I 88 5 \ve.re laigllly esteen1ed. In both reports a number of :suggestions and reconlmenda- tions vvere n1ade, which were \Vorthy of note, The report of :1885 contained, atnong. other things, a careful study of the bank note issues of other countries and also the following in1- portant recotnim~endations to Congress in rela- tion to silver l:egislation : '''If it is for the best interests o,£ the United States to issue a circulation based upon silver, (the Conlp- troller) believes that the circulation should be issued upon coin or bullion which contains a sufficient nun1ber of grains of silver to have an intrinsic value in the markets of the world to its nominal value * * * and (the Comptroller) is of the opinion that, under certain restri~ctions and regulations, it would be far more correct in principle to issue silver certificates based upon a deposit of ·silver bullion, to be valued in the exact proportion of silver to gold, than to continue the issue of certificates under the present la\v.\ The sug- gestion embodied in this ~ecotntnendation, which was also contained in the report for 1884, has since become a la\v. . pennission was given to National banks to ex- tend their charters had been in operation but a short time \vhen Henry W. Cannon becan1e CotnptroUer ·and inasmuch as the charter of n1ore than 8oo banks expired during the year ending November rst, r88S,.it became neces- sary to pay especial attention to this work. A new code of procedure was arranged. It was necessary in all instances where a charter was given, that a careful exatnination of the affairs of each bank should be made and as the la\V provided that the new charter can be given only when the Con1ptroller is satisfied \Vith the condition of the bank to be ex- tended, the personal labor and difficult duties arising frotn this \vork were very great and required ard uons labor. During Comptroller Cannon's term of office, a complete change in the political complexion of the government took place ; the election of Grover Cleveland to the presidency caused rnany changes to be n1ade, but the office of cotnptoller being non-partisan and 1\1r. Can- non's views on finance being in accord with those of President Cleveland, as they . \Vere with President Arthur's, he was urged to re- tnain during his full tern1 of office, viz. : six years. He enjoyed the confidence and esteetn of the secretaries of the treasury vvith whom he served and he was frequently called in consultation in regard to some of the tnost in1portant n1easures connected vvith the ad- n1inistration of the national finances. Judge Folger was secretary when Con1 ptroller Can- non was first appointed ; Hugh McCulloug_h follo\ved for an interim and afterward Daniel Manning. As. there seemed very little pros-

Comptrol.ler Cannon preferred to return to an active business life, rather than to remain in government service, so, earily in 1886 he resigned and transferred his res.iden ce to N ew.York city, February 1st, and accepted the vice-presidency of the National Bank of the Republic, in Ne~v York city, the president being Hon. John Jay Knox, his predecessor in· the office of comptroller of the currency. November 1st, I 886. he resigned frorn the vice-presidency of this bank to accept t1a:e presidency of the Chase National Bank, of New York, where his rnature thought and ripe judgtuent have produced results that are phP.nomenal and I-Ienry W.

He was professor of !nathematics and civil engineer- ing at the Rose Polytechnic Institute, Terra I-Iaute, Indiana, from r883 to r886. Since I 8.86 he has been professor of civil engineer- ing at Union College. During Prof. Bro,vn's connection with the college his departn1ent has grown wonderfully.

Last Saturday witnessed the second league game on the home campus, and the second walk-over for Union. Of course the 'valk- over was a foregone conclusion, but that the game would result in the thorough scaring out of the visiting tean1 at the end of 35 tnin- utes of play was not anticipated. If it had been there surely 'vould not have been suc'h a large attendance of lovers of the game, who were not only disappointed but disgusted. Syracuse died game, but Hamilton sulked, whimpered and then cra\vled. Her team saw from the start that the day \vas lost, and so took every opportunity to kick (not the ball) and kill lime, and finally withdrew from the game upon the :grounds that the umpire allow- ed Union to hold in the interference.

Hudson, surgeon of the Fitchburgh raikoad, is sufficient guarantee that the arrangements, both for the accon1nlo- dation of the public and participants, \Vill be perfect. Excursion tickets at greatly reduced rates \vill be issued by theN. Y. C. & H. R. I<-. from all points as far 'vest as Utica, and south as far as Catskill.

Ho\V pleased the Union men looked while the tune of 66-o was being played. ---~ The result of the recent election and of the game with Syracuse were very gratifying to the college. If you are classified atnong the members of the .. \ Red Cross\ society, take the hint and square yourself with THE CoNCORDIENSIS. A certain undergraduate made the ren1ark the other day that his conscience would not let him go to New York to see· the Yale- Princeton game on Thanksgiving day when Union is to play Dartmouth. I-I e said that he thought it was his duty to be on hand and encourage his o\vn team by ·his presence. This is the kind of college spirit tnore of which should be manifested by the undergraduates. Students, be sure to see the game in 'vhich your college tean1 participates. The one great difference between the finan- cial condition of the United States and that of THE CONCORDIENSIS is that lvvhile the former is piling up too n1any silver dollars in its treasury, the latter at the present time is collecting too few into 'its vaults. ---· It would encourage the Union team and aid then1 very materially in their game with Roch- ester if our alumni and the friends of the .col- lege in the western part of the state should at- tend the game., wear the garnet and give a Union Hikaht occasionaHy. It will be the one opportunity for our western aiumni to see the best team that has had the honor of repre- senting Old Union on the foot ball field. The men corn posing the foot ball team which can1e here from Han1ilton college last Saturday, \\':ere placed in a bad position through the obstinacy of their captain and manager. T'he captain, although he had no reason for ~o doing, persistently kicked and his n1anager upheld hin1 in his action. We understand that there is much dissatisfaction among the n1embers of the team on account of the disgraceful conduct of their manage- nlent. When the team had played a fe\V mornents it was evident that they did not know everything about foot ball, and when they left the field, by the order of their cap- tain, a lack of knowledge of the general principles of squareness and fairness was s~own by the managetnent. GLEE CLUB. The officers and men1bers of the Glee club, for the season of '93-'94, are as follows : Pres- ident, E. Lee Auchampaugh, '94; vice pres- ident and leader, James E.

This \vas substituted for the regular debate. Some of our students \vill attend the gan1e at Rochester, Nov. 25, \Vhen Union a.nd Rochester play the final game in the cham- pionship series. By the kindness of Manager Benedict the foot ball tean1 occupied two boxes at the Van Curler last \Vednesday evening, when Hoyt's \A Trip to Chinatown\ was presented. A large number of students- were scattered about in the audience. The Phi Deita Theta fraternity have initi- ated the following men: E. W. Sayles, '96; G. M. Schofield, '96; L. M. Schofield, '96; H. P. Willis,. '97. Owing to an oversight the names of the Sign1a Phi initiates \vere omitted in the last issue. They are as follo·ws : Able Sn1ith and Paul Canfield, both of '97· '[he n1eeting of the Christian association held Tuesday afternoon, Nov. 14, was largely attended. Professor Webster gave the stud- ents a very interesting and instructive talk on ''The Christ-Life, the Type of all True Liv- . ,. 1ng. The Juniors gave the second of their series of hops in the gytnnasiunl last Friday even- ing. The affair was in every way pleasant and successful. Among those ·who were pr~s­ ent, \Vere the follo\ving: Misses Herrick, Walsh, }lorton, Pruyne and Giltnour of Albany, Miss Phillips of Amsterdam and Miss Jackson of Fort Logan, Colorado. The 'fhanksgiving day game to be playrd on the \!Vest Troy grounds by the Union and Dartmouth teams promises to be a very great attraction. Doctor Hudson, \Vho has the affair in charge, has arranged for excursion rates on the Ne\v York Central, Delaware and Fitchburg roads. If the clerk of the weather bureau will give us a fine day a large attendance n1ay be expected. AMUSEMENTS.

To-day with face serene and bright She takes with me the marriage rite,- For heart and hand together go- I hold them both.

There's a sturdy flavor Of tobacco in the air- And the feet of a Sophomore resteth On top of a Freshman's chair; On the campus are voices ringing, And th.e noise of feet. Alack! I shake myself up like a grizzly While I sadly say: I'm back! Last night there was pandemonium; And tihe Frosh like startled deer Took covert 'neath many blankets, Or bravely ''set up the beer.\ And I turned on my couch in anger- As Morpheus flew at their clack- Denouncing their actions as \silly\ Whi1e I sadly said: I'm back! I'm back! Yet I see1n a dreaming; It is; and so it must be!- But I met you last night, oh maiden, Who .S\Yore to be true to me, And your eyes were looking so sweetly- . They always have had that knack- In the glowing eyes of a Freshman!- And you know that I am back! I recall when I, as a Freshman, Held Seniors in greatest awe; And the bright armor of a Junior Revealed not a sign of a fta w; Then a Soph was a thing of terror; While wisdom I seemed to lack;- But the mist has raised frmn m.y vision; And I sadly say: I'm back! And yet there is never another Old room half so dear to n1e; There is not a nook here, nor a corner, But hath place in memory; And here I have solved many problems That once seemed most hard to crack: And here I have dreamed of you, darling; And so I a1n glad that I'm back!
