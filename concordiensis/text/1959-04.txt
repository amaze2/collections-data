Dr. Davidson stated, \Dean Pollock's experience in the last eight years at O'hio State and Penn State Universities has been primarily 'in student ootlvities and fraternity counseling. Therefore, he seems ideally prepared to take over the respoll.9ibilities of these two important areas. Since Pro• fessor Finkelstein is going to Eu- rope on his sabatical in 11}59•1960, it was necessary to find a new coordinator of student activities and Dean Pollock's appointment takes care of that need'!'

Featut·e.-; ·EK:litor Who Pays The Fiddler The action taken by two irate citizens of the Union College community at Tuesday night's meeting of the Student Council has brought to light a situation which is of no mean importance to the student body. The citizens in question presented to the Student Council their v~ews concerning the action which the Student Tax Com1mttee had chosen to take against the Idol. The Student Council was informed that the Tax Committee had decided to prevent the publication of one of the two remaining issues of the college's literary magazine, and Mr. Walte1· Casey, representing the Tax Committee, was asked to defend its views. The ensuing discussion was extremely enlightening for sevel'al reasons, but most important it emphasized the Student Council's ignorance of the proceedings of the Tax Committee, which is, in the final analysis, a committee of and created by the Student Council. · We are not criticizing the action taken by the Tax Committee, nor do we wish to comment here on the rea- sons for the Tax Committee's action. It should suffice to say that the situation was 1·esolved by the Publications Board to the satisfaction of all concerned; there will be. if all goes well, two issues uf the Idol yet to be puLlbhcd this semester. , Sometimes, analogies are of considerable use in presenting questions of a more theoretical nature. \rhen examining the pu::;ition of th.e Student Tax Committee, it \Vould not be absurd to recall that seve1·al eenturies ago the office now occupied by the Prime ::\Tinister of England was then assumed by the First Lord of the Treasury, a man of importance, to be sure, but not nearly as impor- tant. and may we add, as powerful, as Albion's l\lacMillan. One must also bear in mind that it was the purse of the Lord Treasurer which, by paying the fiddler, called the tune. By virtue of its constitution, the Student Tax Com- mittee does exercise a good deal of control upon student acti\ities. In addition to the arithmetical chore of ap- proving budgets (which can best be accomplished by a select and capable four-man committee), Student Tax exercises its powers to see to it that student activities function properly and efficiently. Yet it must be remembered that Student Tax, power- ful as it may seem, is essentially a committee of the Student Council. It is the Student Council which is re- Glee Clubs ....

The concept of a Glee Club has evolved considerably from its ·humble beginnings in the late sev- enteenth century. The Glee Club of London grew out of informal aft~r-d·inner singing of catches, madrigals, canons, and glees. Soon the group moved from homes into taverns. Vvith the acquisition of •its ov.-n concert hall and the ad- dition of the accompaniment -of organ and orchestra, a new pur- pose in glee clli:b singing was in- troduc<:d, namely, public perf-orm- ance instead of practice for strict- ly personal enjoyment. The concerts that the early American college glee clubs gave resemb!Pd YaudeY.ille shows with every-thing from s'mging, •banjo- playing, and jazz orchestras to acrobatics and dancing. Extra- curricular music was reputedly mediocre, had little or no pl'ofes- siona:l guidan•ce, and limited it- self largely to pqpular college songs. The Harvard Glee Club inH!iated a revolt in 1918 and began to de- vote itself to serious musk.

The Geneses Brewing Co., Inc., Rocllester, N.Y. / With the advent of the vlrtuosi or paid musical performers, the niUsic took on a new and more complex air. The two baroque composit'ions by Henry Purcell re- flect this trend toward. a more serious form <>f' mu:sic in England, but they have not as yet reached the stage where the compositions are as eomplex: as the works writ- ten on the ·contingent during the sa:me period. Purcell represents the last great native English -coon- poser, because in the period fol- low'mg his death English music was to take on some of the more ornate tmppings of the German- Italian tradition. THERE'S AN IMPORTANT FUTURE AHEAD FOR THE MEN Handel Was Innovator Handel. not a native En.g!ish- man, was the innovat<lr oct: tlw new concept of music in England. When he first emigrated to Eng- land he .produced his operas in the Italian style that bad already tired London aud 1 iences. After the rejection of his works by the 'People and finandal bankruptcy, Handel introduced the idea of the oratorio based on the Old Testa- ment, which h~ rorrertly tl'lror- i7Pl could not hf'> rPj!'rted hy thP ·people.

Ruth has been a leader in campus activities through- out his three years at l 1 nion and has rarely failed to dem- onstrate the initiative, the clear and free thinking, and the personal integrity which all form an essential part of an al.Jle student administrato1·. Although his list of activities is weig-hty, what has impressed us even mm·e has been his ability to carry through to a strong conclusion any situation which he has attempted to tackle. His performance as President of the Junior Class has been highlighted by a highly successful Jazz Concert and a thus-far well organized sponsorship of the Spring \Yeekend to be held :\lay 1-3. As a member of the Student Council, Ruth has led the initiati!m of the Under.:Graduate Alumni Fund-Raising Drive and has worked ably to publish the soon to be re- leased Leadership Training Guide. The position of Student Body President is the most responsible one in student government at Union. It offers the uppo1·tunity for an individual of exceptional ability to initiate steps directed toward the solution of many of the major problems facing student government on the campus. We feel Ed Ruth has this ability. -Vis Aiq Photo by Jim Lillie Pictured above are the three leading characters of the MoWiteba.nk's production .of ShakesPeai'e's \As You Like it,\ which •will open tonight in Haruna HaD.

When informed of how his constituents wish him to .vote, the councilman is able to adequately represent his classmates, but when he is unin- formed he must make judgements as to what his good sense sug- gests. These judgments usually are. and definitely should be, the same as those opinions and de- sires expressed by his dassmates. EVANS: I feel that after the actual election of the Councilmen, campus interest lags. This poses a problem, that .being-how does one get class opinion on the mat- tPrs before the Coun-c'il? Indi- vidual contact b~comes almost im- possi·ble. This necessitates a strong student intere..~t. Si.nce this appears to be lacking at the pres- E'nt moment, t.lle representatives must use his judgment -in Council decis'ions-I know that these men have Union's jnterest in mind and not pereonal preference.

MnjorExam Is Required Beginnin!l' with the class of 1962, all candidates for the A.B. <Iegree must pass a major field examination administered by the Department or Division in which the senior has majored. The Faculty Council, which passed the measure, felt that these exams will make it neces- sai\y for the student to fill out gaps in the program and force him to integrate all his studies and work towards a central goal. Since major field examinations will necessitate a more careful selection of courses, those stu- dents who have already begun work on their majors will not be subject to these tests. The test, which will be deliv- ered to seniors du.ring the week preceeding spring finals, may be from nine to twelve hours in dur- ation. It will be broad in na- ture and will allow a large range of cboice. Seniors who are can- didates for the A-B. degree will be exempt from all final exam- inations in that semester in which they are to.l{,ing the major field exams. The five year com- bined Engineering and A.B. de- gree candidates will have to complete the usu.al examination requirements in Divisions.

Academic Renaissance With the college year rapidly drawing to a close, the student body has ratl1er ·suddenly found itself in the midst or' a deluge of proposed and, in some cases, already approved revisions of the academic program at Union. These revisions, whicll, if adopted, will produce signifi- cant changes in the curriculum of every Division, appear on the scene as a breakthrough in the complacent appear- ance of the attitude of the faculty toward the academic program of the college. Most of the innovations and proposals ; honors pro- grams, Divisional projects, major field exams; are con- cerned with strengthen.ing the senior year at the college. The senior year is one in which thr ~tudcnt ~hould he stimulated tv delve uet!J!i.Y into the major field of his in- terest, and, after intensive study in this field, attempt to correlate and integrate his knowledge gained through specialization with the broad foundation he has formed during his first three years at college. The senior year at Union, however, has degenerated into active lethargy. What should l>e the most important year in a college student's career has becomP instead an impatient waiting pe1·iod till commencement. The faculty has wisely realized that in its present form the senior year ()f college is of limited benefit to the student. Hence the:y appear ready to initiate the ad- justments necessary to stimulate the sudent into the original work which should culminate his undergraduate career. It is hoped that the current proposals will form the basis upon which the faculty will eventually build a new and revitalized academic program that will give the col- lege curriculum the sco}le and depth it needs. The Final Decline The effects of the proposed rev1s10n of the College Calendar, which is cmrently under consideration by the Faculty Council, are far greater than might be suspected at first glance. Although the revision appears to be de- signed solely to shorten the college year by two weeks and hence improve student opportunities fo1· summer em- ployment, if put into practice its retlercussions will be considerably more far-reaching. By reducing the examinations week lu a :;ix-dav pt>riod, one cuts in half the amount of time available to prepare for exams. However, the corresponding shorten- ing of exams from three-hour to two-hour sessions will not ih any manner alter the amount of preparation neces- sary. Thus although th.e amount of work needed to per- form adequately on a hattery of exams will remain con- stant, the time alloted t<l do this work will be cut in half. The most prominent effect of these changes is a de- emphasis of the final exam as a criterion for grading in a course. The student, under the increased pressure of the shortened time period, cannot be expected to perform as well as he might have otherwise, nor can the professor be expected to gain a rnore complete picture of the stu- dent's accomplishments by a two-hour exam as opposed to a three-hour test. •·:rHE BLIND DATE\ Role of the College President The Faculty Outlook By Carter Davidson This is anotlter in a series of intermittent columns to be written by fa.ettlty members at the request of tbe CONC()'RDIENSIS, con- cerning matte1•s of ·pertinent in, terest to the college coonmnnity.

One of Keezer's successors at Reed', President Odegard, also resigned in order to become a Professor of Po:J1ti- cal Science at the University of California. President Gilbert White of Haverford College, one of -the best endowed ~d highest academic small colleges in Amer- ica, resigned to return to the University of Chicago as Profes- sor of Geology, saying that he had to return to teaching before he grew too ·far away fi\om the developments in the field. Presi- dent Benjamin Wright of :Smith College is leaving Smith this June in order to return to the field of teaching Economics. Presidents Were Successful The interesting thing about most of these cases. is that individuals concerned were eminently succesS- ful as college presidents, having ,;ucce<\ded in raising money for endowment. for salari'es, and for new buildings.

President Harold Taylor of Sarah Lawrence Cllllege has an- nounced his resignation at the end of this academic year in or- der that he may return to teach- ing and scholarship in his aca- demic field of Philosophy. He explained the l'easons fol' his de- cision in an article published in the New York, Times M.agazi:ne of April 12, 1959. He argues that the American college and uni- versity have become so compli- cated and so beset with financial problems that t:he chief admin- istrative officer must spend all of Ills tim.e chasing money and nmki11g- sJ,.tt:eche,; in the interest of rreatin~; .fl'irnds .for the insti- tution rather than in giving edu- cational leadership l(). the faculty and student body.

President William Stevenson of Oberlin College has just announced a similar decis- ion, after having been at Oberlin approximately the. same length of time that Taylor has been at Sarah Lawrence.

And I've found that the biggest challenge a man has to face on his job is not the competition of others- but the far more important one of .develop- ing himself to his fullest capabilities. \J).uring my four years with General Electric, I've had plenty of opportunity for self-development. Chatlenging training assignments at five different locations within the company have given me a broader understanding of my career area. In my present job I have the benefit of working with ex- perts, both in establishing long-range goals and in helping to achieve them. I've found that working toward future potential is vital in the development of successful businesses - and successful men.\ Young men such as Gerry Pa1·sons are important to the future· of companies like General Electric and to the growth of America's dynamic, competitive- e.nterprise eeonomy. Our nation's progress will de- pend more and more upon those forward-looking individuals who continue to develop to their fullest capabilities during their lifetime. That is why General Electric provides a climate for individual progress- with opportunity for in- creasing knowledge ancl skills -for all of its em- ployees, including 30,000 college graduates: For it is only as individuals meet the challenge of self- development that there continues to be progress for a business, an industry, or a nation. 1nJgms Is Our Mod lmporlanf' PtfJI!vd GEN'ERAL f) ELECTRIC 3
