·.:,. ,. l ' ' i . CoNCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 5, i907 No.1 Dr. Raymond's Visit On Thursday morning, in Chapel, Dr. Ray- mond, recen~ly ' r~turned from his trip abroad, delivered his first talk to the students of Union :5ince his resignation. Dr. Raymond's talk was very impressive,. and in spite of the fact that he declared himself mer~ly an unofficial vis- itor, everyone l'stened with the greatest atten- tion to his words. In part Dr. Raymond spok(~ as follows: \For the first tilue in thil\teen yc>ars this· col- lege has opened its fall seaRon without a word of \.\:elcome, without a word of congratulaUon fro·m rne. l am here this morning not so much TJy righL as by courtesy, and I speak not as president, but as a vis-itor. vVhat this means does not affect you as it affects me. If I were to yield to that and let the meinories which rush upon m.e influence me, I could not speak this rnorning. \As I walked rtlong thn ea.Inpus yesterday, I could have wishPd with all my heart that the old relations were still in force, for no other place in the world means to-day or can ever mean what Union means to me. However, I d:d not know that it would be so hard to leave. I do not believe that it would have been possible for me to have resigned but for the . experiences through which I have passed, and even then, if I had felt that I ought to stay here on the hill day after day and work among you as I had always planned, no other call or opportunitY of service could have taken me away, However, I knew that as president of the college I co.uld not shirk the responsi- . bil 'ty of its financial condition or of the out- side work. I knew I could not refuse to travel, · and under the changed conditions of my life. that was simply impossibl'<k, and so I asked the Eoard of Trustees to release me. .. \Now for the first time I am speaking to you as a friend and not officially, and I freely say that through all the years that we have asso- ciated with each other, as $.ludents and presi- dent,' we have never lost faith in each other, · and of ·an the years that I ·have spent here as pl'·esident, none closed with such feelings of deep confidence as last year, in spite of the bad beginning we made. ''That sugges.(s something that I want to say. I suppose that things are .going to run on very smoothly, out if the time should come wh:'n you feel that you have to take a stand against the faculty, rem em. her that the presi- dent and the faculty are just as honest and ~incere in their opinions as you are, and that th<.'Y are just as devoted to the interests .of the college a~ you are, and that their experience gives their· o.pinion perhaps a little more weight than yours. Now, if you remember that, you will save yoursPlves so1ne pretty hard thoughts and .maybe some hard words and ·perhaps some rather unseemly ~nd discourteous acts.\ Dr. Raymond spoke of his trip abroad, es- rwcially of Holland, Germany and England, concluding by saying: \I saw nothing in Europe which compared wilh the beauty of the Hudson River as we came up the nthC>r night, with the sun setting ju~t behind lhP Catskill Mountains. After all, ihPr~:' is no place that comparE'R with College Hill at Schenectady. I am back here for a day, but you are going to see rne often.. I will come back just as often as I can. I am no longer president, but I am an alumnus of the collegp, and you cannot destroy that r~la­ tionship. I am ~till interested in undergradu- atp lifC', and I propose to go on knowing n1en here as studPnts unt.il the> account closes.\ The Faculty Resolution At itH first 1neeting of the year, the faculty of the college passed a set of resolutions relativa to the resignation of Dr. Raymond from the p-;: es:dency, that vvere presented to him this week. Th~ ·resolution read as follows: \lVIeeting to begin a new college year, the faculty regrets to find itself without the guid- ance and counsel that has so long directed it. At this: its first meeting since the resignation of Dr. Raymond, it would express and enter on its n1inutes its great regret that he is no longer to be a~ the head of affairs at Union College. \The presidency of Dr. Ray1nc nd has proved to be a turning-point in the history of the col·

Under t:h.Ej a.dministratio.n of his pre-de- cess:or, p;r.ogress 'had been made f_rom e.arlie.c conditions, blit much remained to be done to enable the college to meet the :needs of 1nodern ed1Jcation. Dr. Raymond's manag-e.ment of the generai and nnancial interests of the college has been elsewhere recognized. This is the proper place to· recognize his unweari.ed effo·rt and successful labors in dealing with the very difficult probi:ems -of internal arrangement, de- velopment, and a·dministrati:on that arose at that time and have since arisen. Much has been done during the years of his presidency to raise and confirm the standards of scholar- ship not only at entrance, but throughout the coHege course. Much has been done to en- courage and render efficient the best factors of college life. The faculty would place on record and express to him its sense Of the value and success of his wo·rk. We regret that he is no· longer to be with us, to preside over our meetings and to aid our work not gnly col- lectively ·but -individ-ually by his counsel and interest. 1 'W:e direct that .a copy of these informal reso,lutions be spread upon . our mi-nutes, and also he s~nt to hiln with the best wishes for his own future work of those who were co-workers with him in the past.\ The Annual Y. M. C. A. Reception On Friday evening, Sept. 20, the am1ual Fresl;u..:uen reception was held in Silliman Hall . an<I. was very well attended, over two hundred l)ei.ng . present. The following ladies of the Dean Ripton would conduct· the evening . pro .. g,ra.m. The Dean addressed a fe.,w words of welcome to the Freshman Class, welcoming them ''to a new -:P·hase- of college 1ife,---to th-€ br@ad:er- fel- lOW$;hip of the whole college rand to th~ fl'i~ndc.. ships of coUeg.e association that .makes one a loyal son of Old Union.\ He added that all the college activities are a part of the ·christian As- sociation, because, as he said, Hwe believe here that the rellgious life has in it room for an the activities of any well-ordered man, student or any other 1nan, and it is for that reason that this general reception is given by the College Y. M. C. A.'' He then introduced r>r. Adams. Dr. Adams said that at a meeting of such character he had thought that it was always the custom to call for speec:P.es first from the rep.resentatives of the various coUege ·activities, and then from the ministerial profession, but that he was glad the order had been reversed, as he was thus given the opportunity to fnre- stall the other speakers. He knew that every one of them would exhort the students to \get out'' and encourage all the college orga-niza- tions, and was glad that he had the first chance to tell them to \g.et out\ and go to c~ur.ch.

Meade, the lite·i~ary edi- tor, has issued a strenuous appeal for literary matter, and thus far has been rewarded with a nu1nber of efforts. The Garnet hoard in meet- ing last Wednesday evening voted to admit the Pyramid Club to representation on the publi- cation, provided that they supp.ort it the same as the fraternities in the line of taxes and the :t)Urchase of Garnets. This change from the old routine of\ having the junior members of the fraternities publish the annual, marks a step forward. The action as taken by the board was deemed advisable, inasmuch as the Pyramid Club comprises prac- l ically the entire student body· of non-fraternity n1en, there being but --- non-fraternity men in college that are not members of the club. The club will be classified under the title of \Organizations\ and in ten years' time will ha\'e the privilege of appoinUng an editor-in- chief for the Garnet. A number of new features will be put i_nto this year's Garnet_, concerning which the man- agC>rnent is as yet silent. The publication will hP out eat·Iy in the Rpring term, if all goes well.

Editor of the Concordiensis. Dear Sir:· There is a matter which I think ought to be brought to the attention of the student body, ·and I take t'his means to do it. I Wonder if it has ·ever occurred to ma~y of us that of all th.j prominent Eastern colleges, Union is almost ·the only· one which allows the indisc·riminate wearing of the college color. That any ma:n in college should be allowed to wear ·a 'garnet hat band, for instance, whether he has ever won his U ·or not is in my opinion a grave mistake. At every ot'her institution th:s is not only discouraged, but not permitted, a.nd it seems to me that the time has come for' us to take a definite stand in the matter. If any one cares to look into. the. mattel! they. will find the~ above refere.n.ce to other colleges: is .true. · 1909. * * * Dear Editor: At the college meeting Monday morning there will: be broug-ht up for· considera- tion a matteJ?. which· i$ of g-re~t imporrt to every .. . ' ' .> ........ .,.__ .... , \ member of the stud~ent body, namely, that ·of abolishing the Sophomore Soiree, introducing the Junior ''Prom.\ in its stead, and making the· present' Junior hops Sophomore affairs:~ ... Essentially, this is a college of traditions and customs, which form a component part of col- lege Hfe, and which, moreover, should he pre- served and not eliminated unless they become particularly obnoxious to the welfare of the college.. The Sophomore Soiree, the most bril- liant social affair of the college ye~r, certainly does not fall under this classification. .The only argument thus far advanced by the ~dvo·cates of the above plan is that inasmuch as the .Junior \Prom.\ is an important social function of other colleges, so ought it to be at . . . TJn 1 on .. J This argument showing not a single • ' 1 ~ • element of plausible reason. can be entirely dis- regarded. The traditions and customs of other colleges are decidedly not the traditions and cus,oms of Union college. However, the ·suggestion advanced with refer- ence to the adoption ·O.f the Junior \Pram.\ as part of our sociiU' life is good and ought riot' to be wholly disregarded. There is ·no defirHte reason why the Sophomore Soiree should not remai1.1- a· So};lhornnre fnnctt'on, and· there· is no possible· reason~ why the Juni\'r hops ·sho111d not be- held' by. the- Junior e.lass· with one- exception, and that is, ·in place of a- usual Junior· hop, a Junio,r \Prom.\ be given at some conven-Ient time duPing the year, in Jun·-or week if e:x:pedi- en,t. Thas -latter plan, if ad0pted, would. do awa-y with any :radical changes which the pres- ent ·plan n-ow contHmp-lates. · CONSERVATIVE. All is in readiness for the Union-.Colgate 'game. Bo.th ·bleachers have been ereeted on· the campu-s and.' all. arrangements complet-ed for the. hand-1-i.ng· of a big crowd. Th:e team has been. ,put through< daily pracd-c~ all week and is in fine shape :for the strug,gle.

THE CONCORDlENS!S cap~ture the W'reaLh of victory, a. fast and .snappy game is assured. In th>e first football game of the season. Uni:on's el--ev-en defeated the St. La wrenct) team last Saturday afternoon at Canton, N. Y.. The man:ner in ~hich Nthe defenders of the garne£\ played the game demonstrates' most forcibly rthe f-1trength of the lineup and augurs well for a 8Uceessful season. Nor must we let the ocea- Bion pass without commending the work of our new coach, \Haln Tenney. Last Saturday's game, Psp ec:auy its second half, reflected the earnest and persistent work of rrenney, and, to llSe the words of Capta.in McNab, \he is a great rt'oach and one who will give Union a winning team.\ The play opened by St. Lawrence kicving off to Union. By a series of mass plays the ball WflR at once rushed through to St. Lawrence's 4 0 yard line, and there, after only four rni nutes 0f play, Captain McNab Inade a beautiful drop kick for goal. The play was well .calculated and the pigskin sailed over the cross bar for the firRt score of the game-Union 4, St. Law- J'ence 0. Union then kicked off to St. Lawrence, and 1 he ball fluctuated from one side to the other in n. number of mass plays. Exchanges of punts followed, Riggs doing the kicking for Union in a very able manner. St. Lawrence finally got the ball at Union's two yard line, where t'hey were held for downs. \Wiith the ball in Union's possession on the two yard line, a punt was attempted. Owing to the ball being slippery, it was fumbled in the pass, and before it could be regained a St. Lawrence player fell on it, making the Rcore, Union 4, At. Lawrence 2, on the touchback. Union again kicked off to St. Lawrence, and the latter team did some very fast work. St. Lawrence tried a forward pass that wa.s so old and simple that the Garnet players were taken by Burpr!se on the attempt. The play worked, and St. Lawrence advanced the ball to Union's 30 yard line, where they were held for downs. Union then advanced the spheroid to midfield, where it was regained by St. Lawrence and ad- vanced by forward passes down the field to Union's five yard line just as ti.me was called. Score, Union 4, St. Lawrence 2. Union started the play in the second half by kicking to St. Lawrence. Union dropped the St. Lawrence man on his forty yard line, and held their opponents· there for downs, · by a series of mass tackle piays. With the bail in Uni'on's possession, the Garnet team ploughed down the field to within striking distance of the St, Lawrence goal, and Wheadon was sent thr·ough for the first touchdown of the game, makin.g the score, Union 10, St. Lawrence 2, I after Captain McNab had nicked the goal. St. Lawrence then kicked off, and Union stGadily advanced the hall toward the enemies' goal. From the forty yard line, Captain Mc- Nab again tried a · drop kick for goal, but, owjng to his misjudg.ment of the force of the wind, the ball failed to cross the bar. When the hall was again in play, St. Lawrence. ob- tained possession of it) and advanced it ten yards. their only gain in the second half. Union then got the ball and fairly rushed it down the field, sending Wheadon over for an- other touchdown. Captain McNab kicked the goa,} and the score stood 16-2, in favor of Union. Union then kicked o.ff to St. Lawrence, and they, seeing the impossibility of advancing the ball, punted· it down the field. Union then went right up the field to St. Lawrence's five yard line, where they were held for downs. St. Lawrence again punted and Union carried the ba 11 back to their ten yard line, with good chance for another touchdown w11en time was ealled. Score, Union 16, St. Lawrence downs, Wlheadon, 2. Drop kicks, n nals, McNab, 2. College Meetings 2. Touch- McNab, 1. The first college meeting of the year was held Monday morning, Sept. 23rd, directly after ehapel.

It was ftP~U~d that the fonner custom of having the Sophon1ore soiree the m.ost prominent social function of ·the miGI.-year festi,;v..ities. · was incon- ~retent for seve·ral ·reason:s .. · In· •the;; · mrst place, the name \Junior' Week'' in itself demands that th~ principal event should· be held und·er the auspices of tha.t class. Moreover, it would add d,i~P.i l y to the a:ffiair· ·to have i.t uun off by upper- cl~~smon ra.the'l' tharn · Soph:(~H~il'O.J.les. · Secondly, that the custom, 'Preva1ent in most of the lead- lng American coileges prescribes a function of tbis kind; and thirdly, that the experience necessary to run off .a lar:g-e successful dance could be gained d~uring the· ·process- of holding a series of Sophoirn.or.e danees~ ·Simila~r to the HJunior Hops'·' of foFmer years. The Junior Class decided unan:mously in favor . . of th2 change and in order to bring it about, decided to prop>0se. i-t before the-. stud·ent body as a whole:- This wil'l 'be t[one· on Monday in college meeting, ·when· a thorough discussion ot the plan will _be asked for. It is possible, as has been already suggested, l hat the series of dances proposed to be given by the Sophomores be entirely abolished and their efforts along soci.al lines center entirely upon one large event as formerly~ except that this event shaH not occur dUFing .Junior Week. Monday's college meeting Will do much to clear up the mooC<ed question. Cbapel Meetin.g· S.ept. 30th, 'o7 At college medting, . Se.pt. 3Oth, '0 7, Captain ' \ McNab· ·spoke upon the game. Union won· at St. Lawrence and showed that his prophesy the week l:l>:efore was fulfilled. He said that on the N. Y. · 'U. trL:p an:dt··HamiU()n trip~ trhat !prac- tically !the whol2 team would be taken 8J:long. He als-0 exp:t~s.e·cl.t the @pitniolll· thatr -if Niagara defeated Colgat;e that Union would also st~nd a good show. SheUey spoRe-- ffn·uthe' C<:vnc<:rr<Jlii)~tls-is and! said that tliJ.,ere would be a change in the mtethod of disltlibution of the C'o-netlrdys this year. ilThat each student would receive a Concordy the! first term alnd if theil' subsc 1 riptions were not paid up by' that time, their names would be Jtiaken trom the Jist of l$ul»sCJri 'be'I·s; Keith spok:e for the instrumental clubl. and requested that as many as possible get out and help along the good work that has already been started. McMullGn spoke and urged all the students who could possibly come out and watch foot- ball practice to do so. Cane Rush rrhe annual cane rush between the Sopho- mores and Freshmen took place on Friday af- ternoon, Sept. 2Oth. The Freshmen, after elect- ing a president, went in a body to Lafayette Street, where they armed themselves with to- matoes. : The Sophomores, however, had not been-· idle, and when the Fr~s-hn.ten- ·made· their appearance in the pasture, tlaey :were: a wai.tted' by . tbe ·whole Sophomore class,, who were arm,ed with bags of salt. After ;the ' P·I\eUminavy scr-mp,. w:hrch lasted o:rily a few :rp.ihutes, ·cap.t. McNab. threw up the cane, and. the real cane• ·rush was . on. For five minutes each ,elass· fougJ:I.t for suprem- acy, and the odds ·seetned to be in favor of the Freshmen. VV1Ji·en. the· tinile was called· and .the hands on the··cane eourtte.<il, the Soph:omores had ten and the Freshmen had· ten. .t' It was thoug¥J...fi'· best :Fwt to hav;e· another rush, but to let the Sowhom:ore .. wresl:i'miali foot~all game decide the· ·tie_, which will occur some time in Nov.e-mb~r. n

= - - s I s - ' - its ge- nal lon. pen - 50 THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 12, 1907 No. 2 UNION'S MUSEUM Dr. Martin Cla~sifying and Arranging. the Sped- mens. (By Dr. Martin). The conc:iition of Union's valuable collectiOl'l of specimens of m1inerals had fo.r a long tilne :been a sou1 ee of concern to Dr. Stoller and Presid6n t Ray1nond before the appropriation for ha vin:g it properly classified could be passed by the board of Trustees. Finally, however, the services of Dr. Martin were secured, largely because 'Of his wide experience in sinlilar fields, of work in the University of Suuth Carolina, at Columbia, and in the College of Charleston. Moreove,t' he was personally known to the faculty or Union and was a close friend of Mr. \Vheatley who pre- sented the mineral collection to the college. Dr. Martin is therefore \Vell qualified to speak on the work he has undertaken, and has ki!1dly· con- tributed the following article for publication~-Ed. Union College has good reason to feel proud of the scientific treasurer which it possesses in the \vlheatley collection of Ininerals. This noble cab- inet will now be displayed in a far better place than it has had before. The fonn.er location of the t;<U:K'S, in the chapel gallery, \vas sadly deficient in light, and the collection has been almost useless there for lack of this first essential in a n.1UH- P.um. The wide gallery of Memorial Hall, on the other hand, \vhere it is now to be i~1stalled, is alm.ost ideal in this respect, being abundantly lighted on every side. A mus2um is not, as rnany in1agine, a place when' objects of interest or of beauty are de- positec1 once for all, and n1ay there re1nain .safely for an indefinite time, without any further ovcr- ::-;ight or care. It is fal' oth2rwise, indeed. Even when the objects t-hem·sclves are not perishable, ~·ct the: y absolutely require 1nore or less of watch- ful attention and lovi:1g care, to keep then1 in good condition. Dust will find its way to then!, gradu:llly cthn their beauty, and finally reduce tht'm nil to a uniform· gray. Such had been the L'ctse to a large extent with the Wheatley c ollec- tion Ht Union for son1e years past. Charles M. Wheatley, although not a profes- siDnal scientist, ·was a man of wide knowledge ancl intPrrBt in scientific studies, and was superinten- dent of several rnines that vvere especially rich in choice minerals. These were, the copper 1nine at Bristol, Conn., ar10ther copper mine at Pel·kio- men, Penn., and lastly the lead 1nines at Phoenix- ville, Penn. At all these, M1·. W'heatley was able very naturally to secure an abundance of the finest specilnens of the minerals obtained, and he thus 'built up a n1agnificent cabinet, enla1·ging it of course greatly by exchanges, so as to secure other fine rnaterial from all parts of the world. This wa~ in the 1niddle part of the last century, anci. at the tilne when it was purchased and pre- se:1 ted to Union College ( 1858) by one of its trus- tee~. Mr. E. C. Del a van, it was one of the largest and choicest collections in the United States. It was certainly the finest college collection in the State of New York. Since then, the first place in this respect has been taken by Colu1nbia Uni- versity, in connection \Vith its School of Mines, but Unioa and Rochester co1ne next, perhaps about equal. Hamilton and Cornell have also fine col- lections, as likewise Vassar, and by a recent gift, Colgate: but Union stands well to the front, as perhaps next to Columbia. The pecular vc..tlue o-f the Wheatley collection lies. ·in the fact that the mines which yielded :::;uch rich rnaterial and are so fully represented therein, have lm1g been closed or worke(i out, and their Ininerals no longer attainable. These 1nines are celebrated in the literature of mineralogy, and speci·mens representing then1, even if not the best, are greatly valued now among collectors and il~ stitutions. Here may be seen such an assem- blage of the1n as exists nowhere else, fm~ abun- dance, size, eleganc<:> and variety. The first place belongs to the lead-minerals fl~om the Wheatley and Brookdale 1nines at Phoe- nixville. The species most re1narkable are the carbonate, sulphate, arsenate, and phosphate of lead, known respectively as cerisite, anglesite, mimetine, and pyromorphite. The two first namPd are white, the third green to orange yellow, and the last green and olive in varying Hhades. The crystals and crystal groups of these several specieH are 1nost interesting and ben. utiful, and hardly to be 1natched anywhere in the world. In addition to these, the Phoenixville 111incs yielded splendid specimens of thL' sulphide of

i ... THE CONCORDIENSIS zinc, or zinc- b·lende, in large and brilliant crys- tals, gal·.ena (.sulphide of lead), in fine crystals, and n1any beautiful crystalline groups of calcite (car- bo<F.l.a4.:.e -e.f Ume), in tints vary,ing fro.m yellow to whjte. The Perkiornen mine yielded various cop- per minerals, but especially a peculiar form of barae (barium sulphate) hardl:y found anywhere els.e, in ;plumose masses of white needles, extreme- ly deHcate and beautiful. These are shown in gpeat variety. The Bristol, Conn., copper-mine furnished several for.ms of copper sulphides, one of which (chalcocite) is of rare occurrence, but was he1·e found abundantly, in fine crystals of a dark slaty-blue color. These were often beauti- fully n1ingled with crystalizations of lime-car- bonate, also re:presented by nu1nerous specimens both large and small. These are the peculiar minerals that give char- acter to the Wheatley collection. With them are gathered and arranged choice and handsome nlin- er.als. from aU parts of the wodd, obtained by Mr. Wheatley, as above stated,. largely by ex- change,. as is the wont of collectors, and also by purchase. It needs, however, to be brought up to date,-to acquire in addition to these old and most valuable minerals, rnany that have become known in the last quarter century,-known, that is, not as new .minerals, but in novel forms .and finer specimens, from mines newly opened, both in this country and abroad. For this purpose, the abu'l\ldant d1:1plieate~ of the collection afford ex- ·e-eiJ.lJ.'ent facilities; and it is1 to be hoped that in the ne:x:t :few years this work may be carried out, -a·n·d -this al-reaay noble and notable collection be f·liTther enlarged and enriched. Meanwhile, let an Union men app·recia te the treasure that the College :i-s so foTtunate in possessing. DR. MARTIN. Dr Raymond's Letter of Resignation Owing to the fact that nmny of the students ~vere out of t0wn when DT. Raymond's letter of resignation was printed in the local papers, it has been deemed advisable to print it in this edition of the Goncordiensis. The letter is well '\VOTth the careful perusal of every student.-Ed. ~T·0 1:he Trust·ees of Union College. \\Gentleme;n.:-I hereby return to you the trust eo,Inndtted to Ine more than thirteen years ago \'1\lit:h the presidency of Union College. \'it has not been easy for me to decide upon trhis l!b-ction. Mly heart is with the college and untti:l a few months ago I had no other thought or des.ir.e than to spe11d the rest of my life in its servi·oe. \Wlhen unsought opportunities can1-.e to n1e to enter other Fields of labor, I dismissed then1 witho·ut serious ·consideration. Since last Janw- ary, however, Ure conviction has been slowly grow- ing that my .duty Ues elsewhere, and this, despHe the fact that the condition of the college was steadily improving an·d the promise for the future daily becoming brighter. I now leave to becorne the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Buffalo, after having rejected repeated overtures frmn this same church for more than two years. ' \Arnong the CO'l'lsilide,rations which influenced Ine during the months when my decision was al- most wnconsciously forming, I may Inentio::n: \First.-The necessity as it seemed to me, of al- n1ost constant travel in the interests· of the ·col- lege. This broke up my hmne life at a tirn·e when honTe responsibilities weighed most heavily upon me. It also interferred seriously with the personal work among the students, the prospect 0f whlch had seerned to justify me in leaving the pasto·ral office for a college presidency. \Second.-An increasing aversion to the task of raising money-a task which the necessities of the situation demanded and which the president could not shirk. The burden of responsibility for financial success rested upon 1ne day and ni,ght and became the heavier as I realized n'lore and m,o.re that I was not titted for it either by nature or training. \I n1ay mention .a third con,sideration which perhaps should have been pla.e.ed first-a feeling \Vhich grew into a conviction, that the work for which I am best fitted is that of the pastoral office. \As I have already intirnatecl, these consJdera- tions while a.lways present in rny thought, did not affect rne seriously until very recently. While the college was passing through its dark days, I believed it to be my duty to rernain at m~ post, whatever the personal sacrifice involved, since to leave would have been taken as evidence of dis- couragement and would have made the general situation still more depressing. Now, however, the conditions are so essentially different that 110 interpretation of n1y action can be unfavorable to the ,college. \If I believed that what has been accomplished within the last few years was due in any large n1easure to my efforts, I might not feel as I do about laying down my office, but no one knows better than do I that the real credit for practical re:sults b.elong to others. What I have done is to stand in my place when it meant something for. the college just to do tnat. I can say, how- ev or de at be th be pE th Re to bt yj. eo to re ta Sc ('() co ra th th of su en th m in Rh nl w' l'P. p'l. th th RE-' w C'O la. gr nr or w

'''ht m'le other respect I :Eeel that ]; have prob- ab!lY he:lped the coUeg:e. Knowing how much had been lost by intern.al dissensions, ~nel beHeving that any reoccure11-ce of factional strife would be . fatal, I have sought dHigenHy t:o prmnote peace. In this work I have had to ignore much that affected IDie personally, and nave doubtless Reerned at times to be too y~elding and concHia- tory, too cautious and fearf,l£1.1 of giving offense, but 1 have acted delib:erate·ly with. one end in yi.ew-peace am:ong ourselves; and I shall be eoHtent if hereafter my administration is chiefly remembered as an era ·Of peac.e after the destruc- tive warfare of nearly hal'f a century. ''In this conrl'ection it may not be unseemly to say that I have tried to cultivate more· cordial relations betw·een the ei ty and the college. Cer- tainly n1y personal relations with the citizens of Schenectady have been most friendly, and I am. confident that among our citizens' interest in the coHege is to-day more general and 1nore practi- cally helpful than it has been for 1n.any years. \You ·will pardon me if I .say further than I feel that I have rendered good service to the college in th.e nmnina Uon of nevY members to the Board of Trustees as vacancies have occurred, and of suggesting to the board the electien of our pres- ent treasurer. No one wiU qu·estion, I think, that the college is particularly strong to- day in the men who are guarding and g-uiding its affairs. \I cannot lay down m.y office without express- ing my grateful appreciati.o·n of the courtesy shown n1e by the trustees, the faculty and the al1:J!I:rJ.ni, the patience with which all have borne with my rnistakes and shortcomings, and the rP.ady support w.l:lich they have given to my p'lans. It is most gratifying to me to feel that there is not one among an those }nterested in the college who would not have :r.n.e stay if my RE' nRe of duty would perm.it. My hear~ is warm with gratitude for the eVidences of regard and conftdenoe· which have come to n'le dUring these la .. st weeks. Nlor can I forbear to speak of the great kindness shown in rny time of sorrow. I nm. profoundly grateful for every ·word of sym- f'lrtthy and every tribute paicl to the m·en1ory of one to whose wisdom and devotion so much of w1utt has been best in my admini:stration is due. Even if I could remain, my work fer the college would not be the same without her. \In laying down the duUes of my office, I do not sever any of the ties of affecUon and gratitude that hind m.e to Union College. I could not if I would. Too many years of my life have been spent here. The memories enshrined here are too sacred. The college will always be in my thoughts and on my heart, and in years to come it will be my joy to serve it in ev,ery way r>oss,i- ble to a loyal and loving alumnus. \A. V. V. RAYMOND.\ Faculty Changes. The routine changes in Union's faculty are Rmall this year when compared to those of other years. Dr. Frank B. Williams, formerly Professor of Engineering, has accepted a like position at Clark University, from which institution he was graduated. The vacancy caused by this has been filled by Mr. W\ilbert Garrison, A.M., who comes to us fro1n Westminster CoUege, lo- cated in Maryland. Mr. Samuel Weber, formerly instructor in Civil Engineering and Engineering Drawing, has accepted a position with the West Brighton Conveyor Company at West New Brighton, Staten Island. Mr. Oscar Van Voigtlander, M.E., from N e\v York, has been engaged to fill the position of Instructor in Civil Engineering .. Mr. William J. Sweetser) who was to fill the position of InsLructor in Engineering Drawing, made vacant by the resignation of Mr. Weber, has been unable to attend to his new duties on account of a serious illness, and at present his position is vacant. Mr. Walter M'. Curtis, resigned Instructor in Mechanical Engineering, has accepted a posi- tion of Assistant Professor of the Mtwhanics of Engineering at the University of Maine. This vacancy has been filled by Mr. LeRoy N. :Baker, B.S. in M.E., who comes to UniG.n from the University of Nebraska. Mr. Frank W. Smith has charge of the Fresh- mt>n in Modern Languages. The services of an instruclor were rendered necessary in that de- partment on account of the great increase in the amount of work. Mr. Smith comes to us fl'om Cornell. College Meeti.ng. In Monday's Chapel m,eeting the first speaker :was Captain McNab, of the footba.H team. Ga.p- tain McNab was greeted by a spontaneous out- burst of app lanse and a number o.f yells th:at showed how much the students app,reci:ated the way the team held down Colgate to @-Q EVt

Captain l\icXab spoke for \~/ Alumni Notes. the team and said that the enUr-e game had been \Yell played, a fact that \vas due in a l.arg{' 1neasure to the support the team received from the studenls on the sidelines with their cheers. 1853: William H.

He was for a long time the confidential adviser o.f Roscoe Conkling and was very prominent in the man- He also urged the students to make prepara- agernent of New York Slate's political affairs. tion for taking the Hamilton trip, saying that he would !like to see at least one hundred men go LB Clinton to outyell Hamilton on their own f.leld. ancl cheer the team to victory up there. Dr. MacComber was the next speaker. He urged all the men to come out for the track who had any ability in that line at alL He sai'd that thE\ burden of all the track work was fall- ing upon thE\ Freshmen's shoulders and that it was the> duty of the upperclassmen to help mould the team into a winning one for next spring. Dr. MacComber also spoke ve1·y favor- ably of the football gan1e of Saturday, and said thaL the students should not be disappointed if the team should happen to lose once or twice during th0 season, but that it showed a true Rpilit of ~portsmanship to take defeat 'vilh as good grace aR victory. \' Man·ago?r MacMullen had just started to tell about the financial end of Saturday's game, \Yhen Hal Tenney appeared. This was the sig- nal for another spirit.ed outburst of applause. Coach Tenney thanked the student body for the:r ovation and for the way in which they had supported the tea1n at the Colgate. game. He saicl thac he was well pleased with the show- ing made thus far by the team, but he said that to keep up itR efficiency it was necessary to have more men out for the daily scrimmages. and he urgc>d everyone to come out and try for the team. Captain ParsonR made a brief speech for the track. He seconded Dr. MacComber's call for more loyal support from the upper classes, and addPd that there would be a shakeup on th(:' track team in the RIH'ing, if the old n1en did not turn out bPt.ter. Shelley, in speaking for the Concordy, stated that thP bm~:ne~R end of thp publication waR now on a finn baHiR, and that arrangements would ht• su('h that the papt>r would reach the Atu- <lents at the Htate<l timP and in good condition, aftt•r th<• first wPek.

At Junior class meeting on Wednesday after- noon, the question carne up as to whom the 19 0 9 Garnet should be dedicated. Dr. Barnes at the final vote received a unanimous ballot. This action has met with great favor, owing to the popularity of Dr. Barnes with all of the eollege students, and the prominent place he has h<-'ld in promoting the welfare of Union College sinee his sojourn he~re. Dr. Barnes entered Union in 1904 as assistant instructor in the Modern Languages Deparnnent. Since that time he has been assistant professor and at present he holds the position of Profes- sor of the Department of Modern Languages. Dr. Barnes is a graduate of the University of Leipzig, where he took his degree of A.B. in 1887, being av'.'arded an A.M. in 1893, and a Ph.D. in. 19 00. He also is prominent in the .A medcan Society of Modern Languages and holds the position of Secretary of thel Faculty of Union College.

Thus far this fall the Philomatheans have led in the display of activity in the debating line, and have already held two spirited meetings. At the lase debate the subject considered was \Re- solved, That President Roosevelt would be justi- fied in accepting a renomination for the Presi- dencs of the United States.\ The opposing teams were as follows: Affirmative-Wright, '08; R .. Ury, '09; Lent, '09. Negative-Tiffany, '08; Faust, '09; Cavert, '10. The debate was so closely waged that the question was left undecided, according to prece- dent establi,shed in the Advanced Argumentation Cla~s last week. r.rhe next meeting will be held on next Wednesday evening, and t'he subject and sides will be poRted upon the bulletin board before that tin1e by the ex~cutive comm.ittee. The AdelphicR will organize during the con'l- ing Wc>Pk, and will in1mediaiely start to get into training to meet the Pal'ker Debating Society · fro1n th~? Albany Law School, in acceptance of the tentative challenge frorn last spring. The Parker Rociety has as yet not been organized for the season's work, so th·e two organizations wi 11 have approximately the same a1nount of trainil\,g for the debate. which will probably o<>cur early in the month of Decernber. Dartmouth's baseball te:::un of last season has bet>n branded as professional, on. account of suin- mer baseball playing.

FOOTBALL :In spite of the fact that Union has been out ot football activities during a year when radical changes were 1nade in ihe rules of playing the ga1ne, she enters the field t l1is season with excellent prospects of finishing a victor, in a large 1najority of her contests. 'rh is is 1nerely indicative of the \iVonder- fu 1 spirit of harn1ony that prevails an1ong the n1cnTbers of the tea1n, and is not due to the fact that there is any superabundance of fine 1naterial in college. T'he players have confidence in the coach, in the cap- tain and in the student hodv, to do the ::,q narc thing at all ti 1nes. · Today th~y are at :\Iiddlehury playing their leve 1 best, and adding, we hope, an- oth c r victory to our already creditable list. .\: O\V the fact ren1ains that it is the dutv of the students to keep on expressing their appro\Ta1 of the \Vav the, football teatn is doing- its share. (t is necessarv that a large nun1ber of tnen be out on. the side lines C\rery d::ty to let the teatn feel the con ficlence that con1es fron1 the cheering. But abo\.Te alL whatever else you, per- sonally, tnay do or tnay not do, save up enough cJ.sh to n1ake the trip to Clinton on the second of next tnonth, when the tean1 got:s np to play Han1ilton.

In the Albany Departm.ents Medical College opened this fall with a. regis- tration of forty-six new students. The sophomores fared a little better, having fo-rty-seven of their members on the roster. Thus the two lower classes are pretty evenly matched in point of numbers, and as a result the scraps have been close. The Juniors number thirty-eight men and the Seniors forty-two, making the total registra- tion at the college 173 men. Students from Massachusetts, Delaware; Vier- mont, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Porto Rico and New York are registered for work at the eo1lege. * * * Coach Hal T,enney of the football team was over at Law School o·n Monday, making an ap- peal for football men to corne over to the daily practice at Union College Campus.

The resignation was a.ccepted, and Prof. Hale was appointed to fill the Dean's former posi- tion. The new board is composed of Prof. Hale, Prof. Landreth, Prof. Bennett, and Mr. Clinton. \f'he new Egyptian tablets are considered too large f01· the Lt'bTary, and will he placed on the third floor in the Museum. Amo·ng the n-ew books recently added to the Library ar·e two di·cLio·naries,.__one of Phrase and Fable, by E;. C. Brewer, and the other a col- le·cti&n of familiar quotations, compiled by EarUett. There has been a need of these books fent fo-.r a lo'Ftg time, as the Library is rather lacking in volumes of the nature of these works. I .. i I ,., ,. I' ~ th te fr Glr In F'.

At 11 o'clock the platform meetings ;;i.J lj Jn the auditorium were held. Such m·ei1 as :ttE!v. , F'. B. Meyer, D.D., of London; John R. Mott, Robert E. Speer and others address·ed these gath- · I .erings. The afternoons were entirely give~1 up · to recreati-on, not the least delightful of all being Tong \\V:alks over th:e 1natchless hills of that region. Many a lonely battle with self, sin and selfish anl- bit·ion was fought out on the commanding hill tops, or arong the quiet brooks. But perhaps the 1nost soul in1press.ive Ineet- ings were those held on Round Top. This little knoll :is j:ust back of D. L. Moody's old home, and is rnad·e almost scared by the two graves o:f Mr. and Mrs. Moody, side by side, each marked by a modest granite stone. Hither the crowd of l1el'egates with scores of visitors, flock, as even- ing approaches, and sit on the grass beneath the ipnes. 'There is no pulpit. And as song, prayer and appeal ring out, and the eyes of the Inulti- tude gaze far acroEs the enchanting valley to the fading g'lortes of the setting sun, rare would be tlw nmn who would not feel his soul soften and his ~\·hole being thrill with the spell of the hour. At dght o'duck the platform n1eeting clo:::;e:::; the llay. E. G. R. in State Whrk. Intercollegiate .1\tli~H Anna T. Jeanes, an eccentric Quakeres:::;, ldt $3,000,000 to Swarthrnore College on the eon- dition that the institution would abandon all forms ()f iutercoll:egiate athletics. The board of tru::-;- tees of the college has not yet taken action on the i11alter, but the prevailing opinion is that Huch l:l policy would be a narrow one to pursue. The Lafay•ette Banner Scrap was won this year by the Sophomores. The college paper suggests awarding the class n~meral to the heroes of such Hct·aps. * * * ProfeHH<>r ( H to Pfleide1·er of Berlin Univet•sily will d<:'liv,er a series of six lectures at Harvard this year.

Captain McNab graphically but briefly described the difficulties of playing on Middle- 1Jury's slippery gridiron, aR unfavorable for both sides, but, owing to Middlebury's familiar- ity with the conditions, being slightly to their advantage. Meade, '0 9, then brought up the proposition of changing the Sophomo,re Soiree to a Junior Prom, advocatin~g as his reason that the main feature of Junior week should be a function given under the auspices of that class. He proposed a resolulion to that effect. Upon re- quest from the Seniors, Stewart, '1 0, speaking for the Sophom,ores,. asked that the matter be laid upon the table for a we,E'k tHl the Sopho- n1ore class courd discuss it in meeting. The resolution was thereupon tabled. Kline, ':0 8, closed the meeting with a little talk on the conditionR that the students of tho A 1 hany Departments have to face in promoting college spirit. He proposed that the Union College Department Inake special efforts to get the students frmn Albany to take an active fn- trrC\st in the football garnes this fall, and infuse so1ne of the Union spirit into their blood.

A ncl undoubtedly still fewer know that just a century has elapsed since h~ was here. John Howard Payne, to be sure, never en- tered Old Unio-n's Blue Gate, no·r walked under its stately elms, nor sat upon the time-honored Terrace; for in 1.907 Union wa.s still in its first home, the old \Academy\ at the C(j>rner •)f Union and North College Sneets. His expenses while at college were met by a Mr. 8ea1nan, a philanthropic gentleman \Vho had becmne interested in Payne at an early age. Charles Brockden Brown, the celebrated Ameri- · can novelist, \vas also active in his behalf and aCl'Oinpanied him to Schenectady. He was in- troduced by another friend to President Nott, who always showed hiln the greatest kindness, although the President was 0ften greatly woe- riecl over Payne's escapades, which would al- nl.ost fill a book. While here at college Payne edited \The Pastime,\ the first Union College Sl.Udent peri- odical. The college fellows were great patrons of his paper and gave it t~eir hearty support, which, along with Payne's literary ability, en- sured great success to his undertaking. He was ve~·y popular at college, perhaps more so with t.h2 student body than with the faculty. He was an officer in one of the literary societies and was master of ceremonies at dramatic per- formances, \Vhich were frequently given in the Chapel. After only two terms of college life he had to leave Union. and all the dear associations connected with it in order to support his father, who had become bankrupt after his wife's death. This young Payne tried to do by his dran1a tic ability, for there flowed in his blood an inborn love for the actor's profession. He won a wide reputation. as an actor and viaywright, but his was a. checkered career. He nu•t with severe reversals of fortune. It was while he was living irnpoverished in a dis- mal attic in Paris that he composed the sweet little song, \Home Sweet Home,\ a poem which alone will preserve the na1ne of John Howard Payne from oblivion . Later fortune favored him. ag-ain and he was nppointPd United States consul to Tunis, Africa. Here he died in 1852, away fro1n his home- land and without a horne. In lhis Fate seemed to be unkind to him, for he who had ye-arned for a \Home Sweet Home,\ never, after his 1loyhood <1ays, had a place '\Yhich he could, in the true meaning of the word, call home.

Rain had fallen on the fh•l·.l nearly every day for two \veeks. Vife do not a::;k you to imagine how Inuddy the field was; it was b(: yond any poetic flight of fancy. Middlebury kicked -off at 3:05 P.M. Higgs ra rried the ball back to our 2 0 yard line. A fake punt was tried, but Union lost 10 yards on it. Riggs punted 40 yards. lVIilldlebury brought the ball back to Uniun's 25 yard line and then tried the forwarcl pass, which fail~d. Middlebury was penalized 15 yards. l\1c.Nab 1 eceived the punt, but was downed in his track~~ on our 10 yard line. Riggs punted 4'5 yards and Fisher made a free catch. vVright tackled him. and Middlebury \vas give-n ten yards. Fisher failed on a free try from placement and Riggs punted from our 25 yard line. Fishe1· brought the ball -vvell back into Union's terri- tory, where iL \Yas lost again. Union punted and Middlebury made another fr2e try for goal from placement, but was again unsuccess- ful. The play of this half \vas all inside of enio~n'R 4f> yard line except in the last five minutes. Union carried the ball to the center of the fielrl and then punted. Fisher missed the catch and a Union 1nan fell on the ball.

'1 here waR mo!'e pun ling in the second half, the MiddlPbLuy backs returning the punts much bette-r than the Union In en, with the result that Middlebu1 y soon had a chance for anolh2r free try frorn p lac em ent. This time the hall missed t hP goal only by about a foot. In thiR half both Union and Middlebury put in substitutPs and the play was livened up fo1· a tin1-e, but as i.l h> harcl to kick against the p1 ick;.;, so is it .hard to wear cleated shoes in clay rnud. Thus the spirit soon died down again .. Union had a good chance to score in this half and pe-rhaps would have done so on a dry field. ThP game encle<:l with the ball or1 Middl€- hui y' s 4 0 yard line. RiggR punted well, each punt averaging 5 yards het.~er than Fishe-r's, bui. the Middlebury backs returned the ball farther each tirne because Union's endR were not down under the punts.

The reinstallation ()f football is the primary cause of this, but ~till, every day there is a good crowd of men out on the track practicing their events for the fall mPetA, which will stal't soon. Thp greatest difficulty has been to get the ITII'n from the thr0e upper classes to respond to the call for track workers. A number Of Ht'W candidates entirely eclipses the attendance of laRt year's point winners. From the Fresh- man c.lass there are no particular shining stars, y<'t, on the whole, they promise to develop into n well-rounded team. Of last year's trac>k ieam, Dunn, who made ~LH'h a rPcord for himself, is not back this ~Pn~~on. ThPre has been a persistent I~umor that hP was attending Syracuse University this fall. This is. however, not the case. Dr. MacCombet·

In 1nosL all the fraternity houses you will see prorninently dis- played the representative emblem, while a visit to the students' quarters the centre of decora- tion is usually the University emblem or their favorite fraternity. These sh~elds are o-f the higher grade order; the emblems are etched on heavy copper plate, then rnounted on a solid piece of oak finished in m.ission style. For one to thoroughly appreciate their beauty il would be necessary to see them. They are carried in stock at the Gleason Book Co., on State, near Centre St., and retail for five dol- lars.

r r , ' ' ' . -. ' THE CoNcORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBBR 26, 1907 No. 4 The Athletic Situation 'Th~ au mission of Gn on into mern bt•rship in the New Ym'k Slate Intercollegiate Ath~etic Union is a matter deserving of the serious con- sideration of eve1 y one having an interest in our athletic future. Membe1 ship_ in such an organ:zation mc>ans new conditions and caiTies with it new responsibilities for all who are to have the privilege of upholding the honor of the college in all branches of a~hletlc::;. Undt\I' the auspices of the above union are conducted cha n1pionship schedules in football, baseball, baske-tball and track athletics and in t:>ach of these there is a wm·ded a banner enl- lrlc'lnatic of chmnpionship honor:-; fm· the win- ning Lea1n. The position which Union shall achieve an1ong the 1ne1n bers of this organiza- ,ion will determine ou1· athlet:c standing among the smaller colleges of our class, both within and outside the boundaries of :\ew York State'. Tlw winning of a cha1npionship trophy in any of Lhe above named sports should do 1nm·e to arouse athletic interest and would be of 1nuch g1 pater value to the college in the end than an occasional yictory over so me larger co liege outside the league. In any event if Union is to take her righLful 1llace as the forernost coll<:•gp in the league tl1e1·e rnm->l be a g<:>neral raising of the standanl of athlei.ic interest and achi(•ven1ent in <-\Vt-'l'Y dt-'parlment. both in 'varsity and in cllass com_- pl't:tion. There must be a higher development of elass and college :spirit throughout the en- til<:' stullent body. Collt-'ge spirit which finds PXpression in vocal efforts upon the bleachers is very commendable in its place, but let no ~tucknt fPt~l that his duty ends there. There is a type of college spirit which fs shown not by E'lH ouraging so1ne one else to do and endure and sacrifice. but by getting into a suh and adua.lly doing the things that are so cotn- mPndable in our neighbor, and there must be a decidE'd increase in that sort of athledc inter- t•st if we are to uphold with credit the honor of· Old Union. Too 1nany are willing to do their work by proxy. As an instance of this n1ay be lnen- tioned the slow resp-onse that has been 1nade to the call for candidates for the Sophon1oore and Freshman class teams. Such a call should meet \\'ith as hearty a cl'splay of class spirit and loyalty as woulcl a call to uphold the class ::-upl'Pmacy in a rush between the two classes. l f we are to rnake a :success of an attempt to su tsti tute a l t-giti mate conte:st under definite ruks for Lh(' undisciplined class rush it dc- yolves upon the classes to get every available candiuate out to train for the class tea1ns. Let the uppPr clas~n1en show the san1e zea1 in en- L·ouraging this that they would in inciting a dass scrap and thei1· efforts will be of substan- tial value to our athl£:'tic interests. In this \vay only can these conteSLS be nuule decisive and satisfacto1 y, and in this way only can the class g-an1es be rnacle · valuable in discovering and dt:·velop:ng future 'varsity n1aterial. Let us makP it a n1atter of class pride to get OUL and tl y for the tean1 and win the class 11umerals. A good class tea:n1 n1eans enough c. andidates so that a strong scrub can be op- pcsed to Uu.· regulars in practice. Silnply run- ning ~ignals is no 1nore sufficient in the devcl- Ol-Jing of a re:tn·esentative class tean1 than iL is :n bringing out the strength of the 'varsity kam. LPt us have tvvo full elevens out for <:'ac·h class all nt>xt wet\k in preparalion for the lJig game. and so let us settle beyond all ques- tion su far as football is concerned the su- rn·cmacy of the two classes. Owing· to the fact that we have no foot ha II gamp scht•duled wilh Hobart, it will probably . lw impossible for Union to qualify for the chan1pionshiv in the 'X. Y. ~. I. A. U. this year. ln track athletics, howc>ve1·, there is no ques- tion but that we 1nay take part. \V'hat are \Ve doing in preparation that we 1nay acquit our- selvc>s creditably in the track me<.'t next May? A few Freshmen have been reporting regu- larly foe work on the tt·ack. About three Sopho- Inm·es an-' doing likewise>. Scarcely any of the n1Pl1 who rc>ee:ved an a\vard in track athlPtics ln~t spring ha \'E' done any consis,pn t training at all. To be sure, the weather condition:::; ha\·e not been any too favorable, but if we n ll' tn n1ake a cre<1ita ble ~h<nving we must work out in spit(• of weathl'l' conditions. \tVhat hn~ be-

,, 6 THE CONC~ORDIENSIS come of the spirit that brought out a full list o.f candidates all last spring under all sorts of discouraging conditions? Is Union going to ai'low Colgate to romp away with the track championship wHhout a struggle? A list of fall meets has been posted, but it will have to be withdrawn unless there are tnore candidates out for training, for to com- pete without training would do more harm than good, and no entries will be accepted unless there has li>een some preliminary preparation. It ·is not expected or desired that men who are playing football should report for tra·ck work, but we do need the active suppon of every man not so engaged. Do you want to see a new cnarnpionship ban- ner placed in the trophy room in Silliman Hall? vVhat are you going to do toward that end? DR. S. A. McCOMBER. Christian Association Vesper service Sunday afternoon. on \Fl'iendship.\ Dr. Adan1s 'l'uesday evening Ineet;ing, H. \\V. Bell, '08, ](~a<ler, followetl by Dean Ripton's Bible Class. As usual, vesper service will be held on Sun- day at 5 o'clock. At that tilne, Dr. Fred Winslow A darns will give his second talk on \Friendship the spe- -cial topic being \Friendship as a Trust.\ His talk of last Sunday was very interesting as well as instructive, as his talks always are. The attendance ·was fair, but not as good as we would like to have. Let us all \get up and get out,\ to use Dr. Adams' phrase, and sur- pri:se both him and ourselves. Tuesday evening meeting at 7 o'clock. H. W. Bell, '0 8, will give his third talk on \The Price of Poverty,\ looking at it more especially from the social standpoint. Immediately following this, at 7:3 0, will be held the Dean's Bible Class, to which all are welcome, and which everyone should effort to attend. make an The Y. M. C. A. Reading Room this year will stl~ive to give to the students reading 1natter that is both pleasant and helpful. A good num- ber of magazines 'has been ordered. They are not all, as yet, on file, but will be in the course of a few days. The city papers will also be on file. Following is a list of the magazines to be found at Silliman Hall: Record of Christian Work, Christian Herald, World's Work, Leslie's Weekly, Bookman, Success, Forest and Stream, Scientific American, Technical vVarld, Eve·ry- body's, M;cclure's, Saturday Evening Post, Life, Strand, Munsey's, Judge, Metropolitan, and Cosmopolitan. At the College Library may be found the fol- 1owing that are not at Silliman Hall: Outing, Outlook, Forum, Scribner's, Century, Harper's vVeekly and Monthly, besides many technical publications. Thus, as rnay be seen, a student is able to avail him.self of all the popular mag.azines of the day. Within a few days i:s to be installed in Silli- rnan Hall a telephone, which will be for the use of aH of the students on the hill. There is a call made for volunteers to work in the Italian settlement in the city, teaching English and other popular branches. The work is not distinctively religious, but gives one an ex- cellent chance to do some good work. Further particulars may be had from Dr. Hale. Alumni Notes }1846-Andrew J .Perry, who has been active in law practice for sixty years, died June 26, at h.is home in Brooklyn, ~. Y., in \his eighty-third year. Until his health broke down, a few rnonths ago, he was in daily attendance at his office on Wiall StreeL. He was graduated, fron1 Union Copegc in the class of '4·6 and at once began his career as a lawyer. He .settled in Brooklyn, where he lived for m·oTe ,than forty years. He was a lifelong Republican and was long prominent in the affairs of that party in Brooklyn. He was the most influential leader in tht' South Brooklyn section, and was for sev .. pral years a delegate to the county committee from the Sixth ward, and twice served as chair- rnan of that body. He was twice a candidate for Congress, and once for C-omptroll-er. He s~rved as general appraiser under President Arthur, and was a Commissioner of the Board ... of Elections of the old city of Br·ooklyn. He \vas a member of the Brooklyn Club a.nd of the Ha1nilton Club. / 1865-David C. Robinson is running for Mem- bE'r of Assembly on the Chemung County Demo- cratic ticket. Col. Robinson is the son of ex- Governor Lucius Robinson, of New Yotk State, and was his private secretary when Governor. Last faLl, as the Democratic candidate for State Renator, he carried Chemung County and will undoubtedly repeat that feat this year. v' 1870-John F.

Y, Crowell and Co. As illustrative of the sty:le of a very attractive vol- u.me we rnay take Prof. Genung's .ctosing pas- ~age, in which he sutns up his estimate of the per:manence ·of the Idyls: \We may be eonfidenc that the rnusic of this modern charactedstic epic cannot die in oblivion, its con.su1nmate art going for nothing, any more than can the music -of Spencer or Milton. Men will return to i. again and again from their newe-r vogu<.'S, as to a symphony of Beethoven, n.s to a timt--hallb\VE'd choral song.; wilt bathe wparied nerves and taste anew in it, as it were, iB the warmth and beauty of the et.erna1 p.ropheey, the city yet to be: For an ye heard a 1nusic, like enow 'They are building still_. seeing the city is built To music, therefore never built at all, And therefore built forever.\ j l875~The Buffalo News has prii1Led the .folM lowing: \Dr. A. V. V. Raymond, alth·ough he has b-een preaching in Euffalo more than two lo years, thinks it proper to say to his hearers at the F'ir~t Presbyterian Church, in his initial ~er.mon as pastor there, thal he come-s whh no nPW philo~ophy and has no ne\V gospel to pro- claim; it is simply to set forth the clailns o:f the gospel a:::; a voice from Heaven, which all mankind should obey, that he raises his voice in that pulpit, speaking now \as one- witl1. au- thority.'' rrhoRe ·who thought that \as the ficribes and PhariseeH\ hE' came from Union Colleg·e with a patent schPme for remodelling evc'rything in the Firsr Chur·ch ancl in Buffalo, from thl\ology down, were mistaken. The Doctor put his ad- mit ted talent~ into a cause already proclairnecl ancl known in its es::::;enc<:' the world over. For such a man with such ideas ,and with a reco1·d as a practical promoter of every pub- lic interest as Dr. Raymond has left in Sche- nectady, Buffalo has work and a welcornE'. In Nchenectady Dr. , Raymond vitalized public in- stitutions. He- ~as in E\VE\rything that was going on, and not to carp or to exploit himself. The man who has put his brains and his per- sonality to the test of conducting a n1odern col- lege is not likely to fall into egotistic pitfalls. FoJ~ if anything on Parth can make a leader of m0n ~<\'<' himsPlf as others see him, it is con- tn.('t with a fpw hundred clear-0yed, irrrverent American youths. To Dr. Raymond's credit it may be .said that his armo·r of personality has not been pierced in that encounter. v' ex-18'85-· -· Robert J. Wands died last month at his home irt Albany, 94 Lancaster .Street. Mr. vVands was one of the most widely known Al- banians. He had been connected with the oy.s- tpr trade for twenty years, and since the incep- tion of the Albany Oyster Company, had been its treasurer. .J 1888-Louis M.

There are no . ._.iceably larg.er crowds in attendance at the meeti:ngs of both of tha local societies, and greater enthus~iasm marks each gathering. The Adelphics have ac last ful:ly emerged from their ch.Tysalis of inactivity, and have blossomed out ~nto life again, having, at their last meeting, pa.ssed a motion to favorably consider the prop- osition of meeting the Parker Society of Al- bany Law School in debate during the early part of December. It is probable that this de- bate will be held in Albany in the interest of the Students' Club. •:rhe question discussed at this week's meet- ing of th8 Adelphics ·was: \Resolved That Swarthmore College would be justified in ac- . cE'pting Miss Jeanne's gift, on the conditions im- plied.'' The affir.mative was upheld by Car- michael, '10, and McCormack, '0·9, while La Cro~Re, '05, and Grover, '10, debated th~ nega- Cve of lhe question; and were awarded the hon<}rB. At Philomathean meeting the question was: \Resolved That a nation advanced in civiliza- tion is justified, in the interests of humanity, in Pnforcing itR auLhority upon an inferior peo- ple.\ Flowers, '08, Lent, '10, and Cavert, '10, cl<.'bated for the affirmative and were awarded the decision. Keith, '08, FausL, '09, and Hani- gan, '11, upheld the negative. The meeting nig-ht of both sociecies has been set for W'ednesdays. Song College Meeting practice opened M,onday's college meet- ing, the Freshmen being put through extra drill by Leader Kline, of the Glee Club afterwards. Captain McNab, of the fooLball team, was the first speaker. In talking of the Rutgers game he paid the visiting team a great compliment, and said that Union had lost to a wor\LhY 'foe, in a well played battle. The only way to re- trieve the loss is to win all the other important games of the season, and this can only be ac- complished by concerted action of the student body in g·ving the team their support. Captain Mc~ab wanted the student body in parLicular to work up enthusiasm for the Hamilton game, and as many as possible to make the trip. arvey, 1, captain of last year's \Pud\ H '0,.... baseball team, who was in attendance at the meeting, was yelled up for a speech. \Pud\ c1Pplored the loss of the Rutgers game, but secondt'd McNab in saying that the team that defeated Union. was a wonder-the best that R.utgers ever produee·d; and the game was won by superior tactics i·n the new game.· \Pud\ declared it was absolutely necessary for the team to win the Hamilton gam8, and, urged everyone to go on tile trip, .and yell for victory. !F''ollowing th. is, there was a call to vote on the previous w.eek'.s tabled motion, concerning the changing of the Sophomore Soiree to a Junior Prom. The Sophomore committee that had the matter in charge for expressing the epinion of their class, wished to confer with the Seniors before rendering a report. An in- fo·Fmal 'canvass of the Senior class disclosed the ,fact that a large majority of 1908's members ;favored the ch,ange. Hutchens; '10, reported. this to the meetil;).g, wh~n the vote on the sub- j ect was taken 'Without furcher debate. T'he 'motion was ca.1Tied by a practically unanimous \rote, so that hereafter the main function of Junior W!eek will be a Junior Prom. insttad of a Sophomore Soiree. The two lo\ret~ classes rema.ined after the close of Chapel meeting, at the request of the Ten·a:ce CounciL The object of the Council was to have the under classmen pass resolutions against the \setting up\ of class roo1ns that has at times in the past serious,ly interfered with college work. In plac~ of registering pro- tests against the faculty in this way, the Coun- cil advised sending a petition through a com- mittee of its rn e,mbers to the faculty. The sophomores considered them.selves bound by last year's promise on the matter, and the Fresh- men passed a unanimous resolution to taboo th~J practice. FoHowing thi~. in an informal meeting of the Tc•rrace Counc-il, Hildreth, '08, was elected chair- Ulan of that body. This Week's Calendar Saturday, Oct. 26.-Union vs. C. C. :\f. Y., on Ca1npus.

DOLLEGE SPIRIT' There are n1any ways of considering this subject of College Spirit, and it has bee~n written about in every conceivable style and for every itnaginable purpose. But, when you boil down your sap of thought on the qttestion, don't you find the sugar of truth crystalizes into Doctor lVIac's idea on the subject? T'o he sure, it's a fine thing to show your enthusiasni. by yelling like fury at ~he football gan1es, and to accotnpany the tea1n on tr'ips like the one to Hamilton, as we're all going to do. Still, there 111 ust be a wee n1ite of a feeling at least, in every one of us that perhaps our cluty to Alma Mater doesn't end with our shouts of ap~ probation when a good play is tnacle at the gatnes; that if we, perso11ally, got into the action, and helped push things along, we n1ight place Old Union on the pedestal of pron1inence that was hers not 1nore than half a score of years ago. You ,ren1en1ber, perhaps, those days when we played Syra- c ~ se off their feet in foot ball with a score of 75-o in our favor, and when the Garnet tean1 could hold the Yale eleven to one touchdown. VVe were no larger then than we are now. \!Vhat is the trouble? Don't you think that you, personally, are largely to bla1ne?

TH·E CONCORDIENSIS II At a n1ore recent n1eeting it was voted that C nion College news s~hould have a wider circulation still, both in the city and in oth<3t parts of the state. tfhe plan finally decided upon is this: The Concorcliensis will be sent to the various preparatory schools, toth in ancl out of the state, and also a weekly letter will he sent to the variotts conn try papers, provided funds can be obtained for such a schen1e. 1~he con1n1ittee is to fincl out approxi1nately j'nst wthat such a plan woulcl cost, and then the Trustees of the College will he a::--ked to give this plan their financial aiel. The schen1e is a goocl one, and should rc cei ve the hearty support of every under- graduate and ahunnus ·who has the best interests of his Allna l\Iater at heart. The Athletic Board is to be congratu- late<l upon devising such a plan, which 1ncans so n1uch for Union. -B. Subscribers The management is sending you the Con- cordiensis ever-y week.

It is not to Union's everlasting discredic that the game was lost, as it was well :played against foemen \Vho were InGre skiHed in the tactics of the new gamel and worked trick plays that at times fairly confused our ends and backs, merely through the lack of expertenee. Practically every l\qan on the tea·m \Yas tn the game every minute of the play, and at the end, by a fine display of ·endurance fairly swept the Scarlet line off t h<'il: feet for big gains at every scrimmage. There was some fumbling in Union's lineup, and at one or two critical points this \:vorked to ou1· disadvan-cag<.=. Union's only touchdown was made in the fit·st half, \vhen the ball was rushed down the field by a succession of line bucks,_ and Potter was shoved over the line for the score. Riggs, from a difficult position, failed to kick the goa 1.

It was punted out of danger ft ern th·s posi ... ion, and the time was too liln- ited for Union again to gain the required dis- tance for a score. }i'o t' R u, gers, Captain Fisher played by far the most brilliant game~ with Quarterback Se- guin<:' a cl('Se second. All of the Garnet play- ('1 fl played consistently, Potter, '09. being par- ticularly ~·teady.

t2 THE CONCORDIENSIS baek by Hequembourg,. Rutgers was thrown back on the next line charge, e:tiled to gain distance on a. eorward pass and again tried lhe outRide ki,ck. Captain Mc~ab .secured. the ball, wh~ch was well in Union's territory, and on the first lineup for the Garnet sent Hequem- bourg around right end for a gain of ten yards. Line plunges gained distance once for Union afl·er this, but then Rutgers held in mtdfi.~ld <UHl gained pos~1E:'Rsion of the spheroid. On the next :play, a line buck, Rutgers was p.enaHzed fifteen yards for offside play, and the ball on an attempted ·ons\de kick vYas caught by Hequembourg on Union's 3@ yard line. Hequem- hou rg then ma.cle an end nn1 of 15 yards, which \\'as not all<nved because Riggs was declared offRWe by the referee>. The added penalty of 15 yards brought lhe pigskin to U:nion's 15 yard line. From h.ere Riggs punted to Rutgers on Union's 3 5 ya Td line, and Wright dropped the catcher in his traekR. A line buck and a ten yard run at·oumd end on a fake kick and for- ward pass brought the RutgerR tean1 to Union's 10 yard line. From here Fir.;; her was pushed nvN' for a touchdown, 15 minu,es after play had started. An eaRy goal was kicked. Score: Rutgers, 6; Union. 0. Rutgers kieked to Hequembourg, who was sent through en the first scrimmage to Union's 3 5 yard line. An end run by Hequembourg of 2 5 yards, and a su br.;;tantial gain by w·right, brought the ball oyer into Rutgen;;' territory, where it wa.s lost through a bad fumble. Rut- gerR, attempting s~raight football tactics for the first time, was held for downs in midfield, and th~ ball went back to Union. A misjudged for- ·wa.rd pass lost 15 yards for the Garnet, and Riggs, on the next play, punted to the Scarlet ~ 0 yard line_ Held for two downs, Rutgers 1 hen punted to Hequembourg, who advanced the ball to the 4 5 yard line of the ~ ew Jersey team. Straight line bucks pushed the spheroid to Rutgers' 1 5 yard line. Riggs from here was ~ent through the Scarlet defence for a t-en yard gain, on a play 1hat resulted in a miniature Rutgers- Union debate being held on the field, in which Union, contrary to custom, carried off the palms of victory. The disputed point was whE'ther or not Riggr.;; was down before gaining the entire distance. On the next play, a pretty buck through Rutgers' right guard, Potter was pushed over the line for Union's only touch- down. R.i.ggs failed to kick a difficult goal. ScorE': Rutgers, 6; Union, 5. Rutgers ki eked off to Pot tel' on Union's 15 yard liHe. Ltne bucks netted considerable ground for the Garnet, but an offsid8 play when the quarterback kick. was attempted, r2- sulted in a 15 yard penalty. Riggs, from Union's 35 yard line, punted to Rutgers' 40 yard tine. Two forward passes on fa.ke kicks advanced the ball for Rutgers to Union's 45 y.::u·d l:inc', \Vhere it was r~gained by the Garnet on a furnble and advanced to midfield as time was caned. Score: Rutgers, 6; Union, 5. 'I'he Seeond :Half Hutgers kicked off to Union, where a poor eatch only brough[ the return to Union's 15 yard 1 11e. After two .short gains on line bucks Higgs punted to ,midfield. Here the Scarlet team made an eight yard gain on a cross buck through r.ight tackle, but were held on the next formahBn, and attempted the forward pass. Failing to make connections with the toss a 15 yard penally \vas inflicted on them, which gave the ball to Union in midfield. Two in- effectual line plays and no gain on attem.pted outside kick lost the ball to Rutgers again. At this point Tompkins was taken from the game and Eagan was sent in to replace him at right en d. pigsn:n to Good gains on end runs forced th-= Union's ten yard line, where the Garnet stonewall proved impregnable to three o.nslaugh ts of the ::\' ew Jersey eleven, and again gaye the ball to the home tearn. Riggs punted to Union's 40 yard line, where Potter made a pretty tackle on the Rutgers play2r carrying the ball. Rutgen~ here tried an audacious trick that very nearly proved successful. The teams we1 e lined up for the scrimmage, and the ref- eree's ·whistle had blown to start t'he play. The Rutgers center, as if looking for a nose guard, stood up in his position and cleverly passed the baH back with his feet. The Rutgers ends ran aimlessly about as if helping the center locate his miRsing property. Meanwhile Fisher, at halfback, had received the ball, and was about to run through the Union line of defence, when ·Peck, perceiving the deception, pushed in and tackled him for a loss. Rutgers made up on the nex c plays, however, and in the third scrim- Inage sent Fisher around right end for a touch- down after a pretty run. An easy goal was kicked. Score: Rutgers, 12; Union, 5. Rutgers kicked off to Potter on Union's 5 yal'd line, and he advanced it 10 yards more before being downed. Two ineffectual lin~ bucks force<l Riggs to punt. Fisher made the catch and ran the ball back to Union's 30 yard I.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 13 line. A line plunge and a forward pass brought the scene of action to the Garnet 10 yard line, where the home team froze together and would not permL aNother gain, winning the baH on. the third do·wn. Riggs punted out to Union's 40 yard. I 11.0. Rutgers' atte1npted forward pass coR~ them 15 yards and they punted to CapLain Mc~ab on Union's 3·0 ya,rd line. Union punted to Hu tgen;' 4 5 yard Iine, from where it was ad- vanced to the Garnet 3 5 yard line by a for- \nnd pass, a line plunge and a pretty forward ll:t.sH on a fake place ki·ck, in which the ball t. haug.:d hands fou1· times. Again Rutgers ltil•cl a forvvard pass, but, faiLng to mak:e con- Bl·(· .. ions, we1 e brought back on the penalty to midfield.

'ri-IE CONCORDIENSIS Gleanings From the Latin Sanctum Yesterday as I was strolling idly do\vn th8 c0rddor of Washburn Hall at five minutes aftei.: one, I noticed thar. the rooms, which were usu- aHy fiUed with eager seekers after wisdom, we:Fe almost entirely deserted. Although prac- tically a stranger to the custo-ms on the Hill, I at once sur•mised Lhat the lorreso1ne air of the place was d1:1e to the fact that th. s was the noon hour. :But aR I approached Roorn 3, tht>rc reach::.'d n1y ears the sound of indistinct voices and con- fusc>d ~murmerings. Filled v\'ith wondL·r at wha::. could be the cause of so much excitement at the hour \Vhen all cares and anxieties about ll'~Hons and professO'rs are forgoUe·n, rny curi- os~ty was so aroused that I stepped in~icle the' vestibule and awaited further dt'velopnl.ent~. And this is what [ heard: \C- what does 'nescio quill' mean'?\ C--- (translating literally)-\! don't know whaL\ ''Yes, I know you don't.\ \No\V V-, I can't furnish you with brains.\ \I know you can't.\ \I suppose you n1ean that Is because I haven't any.\ Soon spoke up another me1nbe~r of the class. \I don't see how you can 1nake thal out of 'a.clibo.' \ \Ein1ply by having a little con1mon sense and using it. ~ow don't he a goose.'' V.-\I couldn't hear half of what you ::-m'<1.'' Prof.-\Well then, you and I are tw.o in a boat, for I couldn't hear a word Lhat you ~aid.\ \::\\ow.'' said the professor. \have I made this clear to you, V-?\ Prof.-\ Go ahead.'' B.-\I don't know what you \vant.'' Prof.-\I don't want anything. I'V(' just eaten my dinner, and had all I wanted.\ \::\\ow, look here, I-, any fool could translate tbat. Do see if you can't be a good lL tie boy, and get your less.on up decently nPxt time'.\ \vViell gentlemen. that will do for today. I don't want to keep you after one o'clock. Good- day.\ The College Shoe Store PATTON & HALL, 245 s·TATE ST., Below the Bridge. ------------------- -------· fJJ If natur_e hasn't built you as well as · you'd hke, suppose you 'let COLLEGE BRAND CLOTHES begin where she left off.

16 THE CONCORDIENSIS COLLEGE SHIELDS VERY p,QPULAR At all the larger co'H.eges the college shield has become very prominent. In most all the fraternity houses you will .see prominently dis- played the representative emblem, while .a visit to the students' quarters the centre o.f decora- tion is usually the Univers,ity emblem. or th.eir favorite fraternity. These shields are .of the higher grade order; the emblems are etched on heavy copper plate, then mounted on a solid piece of oak finished in mission style. For one to thoroughly appreciate their beauty il. would he necessary to see them. They are carried in stock at the Gleason Book Co., on State, near Centre St., and retail for five dol- lars. One ~on an Alumnus There was a contest in an estate in which Le R·oy people \Yere interested in progress in the Surrogate's Court, and a woman witness was on the stand. \And · what did the doc .or tell you?\ asked the lawyer, who ·was questioning the lady. \He told rne to go to the devil,\ responded the lady, ''Tith a glint of fire in her eye. \Well what did you do?\ \I called on a lawyer at once.\ \Who \vas the attorney you consulted?\ asked the questioner, after the general laughter caused by the last response had subsided. \~cott W.
