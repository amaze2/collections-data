Hampton's Maagazine. aging the traditional cap and gown f.a.r ·College women. Dr. S:celyte, on his seventielth anniversary, has resigned the presidency of Smith in accordance J with his reiterated decision to retire at three score and ten. He has been at th•c head of S·mith :since 1873. The college was chartered in 1871. He was born in Bethel, Connecticut, September 20, 1837, and was graduated from Union Co1lege wh·en sca.rcely 20. A period of study at And-over and in the Universities of Berlin and Heidelberg followed, after which he became pastor of the North Congregational Church in Springfield, Mas- sachusetts. Previous to this he was married to Henrietta Sheldon Chapin of Alb.any, ~ew York. Atfter about two years of pastoral work he accept- ed a professorship in Amherst College, where he remained until he was called to take up his work with the new coUege in Northampton. T'he founder of Smith College, Miss Sophia Smith of Hatfield, Massachus·etts, made H plain by the terms of her will that men should have a part . ' in its government ~n.d instruction, \for it is a mis- fortune for young women to be ·educated wholly by their own kind,\ and the selection of President Seelye was in accordince with this provision. In all the country there could not have been found a man hetter suited to carry out the ideas of Miss Smith. H.is c-onception of the ideal college woman is that she musrt be refined, educated, gen- tle. His business capaeity is s'bown by the wonderful gro·wth of the college. CoUege Hall, the first aca- demic building, was dedicated July 14 187i5, the president then being formally inaugurated into of~ fice. The college op,ened with four resid•cnt teach- ers and fo,urrteen students. The fund provided by Miss Smith's will amounted to $3:8 1 6,6 1 08.2·9, to _ll. LETTER. E:ditor of the Goncordiensis: Dear Sir: -S:omething- that has been bothering n;.y inind of late a,nd which is to n1y mind, showing a falling off of the Union S}Jirit is the small sho\V- ing th·e students made at the Arrnory during the Ro-chester ga.me. There were about half of the men present and they did some good cheering, in spots, but they a.re not showing the skillful cheer- ing and .singing that characteriz.ed our football games last fall. . There is no excuse for this eitll'er. The game was played on a s~aturday evening, thus letting the men o.ff from work. The sport n1ay he. sniffed at by S·Dme as being a minor one and not needing· much support. That is a very erroneous idea} for the team represents Union, every Union man, not a bunch of fellows 1 who like to pla.y W'c have beco1ne famous for our cheering and singing, but that fame will be short- lived if conditions such as existed at the Roche!~­ ter gan1e continue. We cannot hope for a win- ning team without every man's support and that must be whol'c-hearted. Burt whether , we Win or not every man owe·s allegiance to Union and to the tea.m whatever it is. Now is the time to, rem- edy this thing. Next Wednesday we play H·amil- ton in the gym, and it's ,up· to ·everyone rto be there and to let people know you a.re there. AN· UNUElRIQRADUATE. I .

g cr in he. or to ere THE CONCORDIENSIS 7 FRENCH ~~ONVERSATION IN TH:E 17TH CENTURY. ---------- BY F. W. SMITH. (Continued from: January 2'9.) · The gentlemea used up all of their energies in surmounting the difficulties of approa-ching the fair sex. But in. France, the l,adies having no ·de- fence but virtue, made of it a fortress more :se- cure than ·casUes fur.nished with numerous locks an.d iron bars and guarded by vigilant duennas. In consequence, the gentlemen were compelled to employ so muc1l attention and ad-dress to gain the favor of the beau sexe th~at they acquired an 2rt almost unlu1:own to ,people of other countri~s. The ladies V¥1ho attended the Rambouille 1'(\- ce-ptions soon came to be noted for their elegant conversation and bearing, so very mu-ch so that they were given. the appellation of Les Precieuses, a term meaning the precious ones. L' Abbe Pure says: \'Precieuse is ,a ·word of the period, a .fashionable word, which is current to- day as was form.erly the word Prude and later Feuillantine.. 'The Precieuses are certain ladies who have been ab1e to rise above common esti- mation and .a~quire a .peculiar designation and rank.\ In another place he writes: \It is said there is a kind of religion among the P'recieuses and that they make some sort uf bolen1n and inviolable vo·ws. First,. the subtlety of thought; second, method in desires; third, ·purity of style; fourth, m.ortal comhat agai,nst the r;edant and the pro- vincial who are ·their irreconcilable enemies and fifth, the exti:rpation of :bad words.\ E·veryone sp·()ke of the beauty ·of the Precieuse language. Cllanges in ·pronunciation w~re made. new wo:rd,s. and phrases were ·constantly inve,nted,. and alteratio:n.s in spellin,g, consisting mainly in I the dropping of superfluous letters, ·were made. Examples of these ·changes are to be found in such words as tete from teste, auteur from auth- eur, merch3!:nt from mes·chant, de-fant from def- fant. Many more can be seen by reference to Som-aize's .Dictionnaired es Precieuses. T·here were endless diseUisSiions about words and expres:sions, the adoption or rejection of which gave rise to many intrigues and cabals. Balzac writes: \S.i feUcite.r n'es·t pas encore F'rancai!s, il le sera ,l' anne'e qui vient.\ Such questions were discusse-d in re.gard to l.a.ngaage ~as, \Ought one to ·write as one pronounces or ought one to fol- low the ancient annd com.mon orthogora.phy?\ Tiley read i.n :public the letters of absent ·per- sons, written and polished with that end in vie'W. W'ritten ·conversation modeled .itself upon spoken eonversa;tioll,., at first, and -curious exam;ples of it .may be found in dialogues in novels, in comedies and tragedies of the ·day. Afterward, when the preciense ·craze became popular, it may be said that its provincial vota·ries tried to speak after the manner of the characters in the current novels, and this is apparently one thing that Mloliere so severely ridicules. At the height of the move- ment, corres.pondence proves that great pains was akin with literature and conversation. In n1an v eases there seemed to be a sea·rch for polished .ex- presston rather than the bringing out of refine- ment of thought. M]oreover, there seemed to arise a desire to ·please the ladies without offending th·eir scrupulous modesty, and there was likewise the apparent effort to veil true sentiment unde.r a mask. A~lthough literature received a good share of attention, it was not the only subject of conversation. W!ar, r·el;igion and politics were also considered and in many instances these im- rort::tnt subjects were treated with a surprising familiarity and insight. Weighty questions did not discourage· the ladies in the least; they were as eager a.s the genlemen to discuss them. ( '1'0 BE CONTINUED.)

Leave not the little spot, Where on the deck my capta,in lie~, Fallen ·cold and d•oad. 0 captain! my captain! rise up .and hea.r the bells;. · · Rise up-f.or you the flag is flung-for you the · bugle trills; F·or you bouquets and ribhon'd wreaths-for you the shor-es a-crowding; For you they call the swaying m.ass, their eager faces turning; 0 captain! d~ear father! T:his arm I push beneath you; It is .some drea.m that on the deck You've fallen cold and dead. My captain does not answ·er, his lips are pale and still; My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will; But tho ship~ the ship is anchor'd safe, its voyage closed and done; From fearful trip the victor ship, com,es in with object won; Exult, 0 s·hor.es, and ring, 0 be1ls! Walk the spot my captain lies, F 1 allen cold and dead. --·----- Last Thursday th•e Schenectady Daily Union got out a Lincoln memorial number, the larg.est edition of a da.ily paper ever printed in Seh·eneetady.

C. Rowell. Dr. Pollo·ck is the iu.structor in economics. anJ me- dia.eval history here~ being formerly chief ex- aminer of the State Civil Servi-ce Commission .and well qualified to prepare a book of this sort. 'The book is well gotten up .and orr~ that is needed by all Who wish to take examinations for c~erical work. l;t not only considers the e~amina­ tions in the common branches of study, but also contains treatises on the marking of the pa.pers a~nd so:rn.'e hints in regard to the National Civil Service examinations. 'rhe essays are prepared by Dr. Pollock and are very instructive in reg·ard to the actual means employed by the RJege:nts in preparing anJ markiNg the examination papers. The san1ple questions make it almost ea.sy to pass such examinations, for almost every sort of ques- Lion is answered as the Boar.d require. The book iE> not only of benefit to those w11o are preparing for examination~, but also for those who Wl~.rH little leisure wish to beco1ne more proficient in the common branches. Th-ere is also a benefit to be derived by teachers who wish practical work for review and supplementary work. AU in all the book is one that will do a great deal of good and will fill a long felt want in many ways. Dr. Pollo-ck is to be congratulaited on this excellent work and all its readers will be gainers from an acuuainta nee with it. For quite a while. th·~ Concordiensis ha,s been ap- pearing at diff;ere·nt intervals, som.etimes through the fault of the printer and sometimes through the fault of the Board.

THE BASEBALl- O,UTLOOK. Although six n1em bers of last year's champion ·baseball team have left college, still the pros- l1ects are bright for another suc,~essful year. Bergan, one of tt e star players en 1:-tst yectt's team, and who was elected captain of this ye- r'::; tEarr.:. expects to return to college tor tile sprl..?: term. There aer two members of the inedi,cal dE.·· partment who have good reputations 3S b::tseb::tH pla:rers and who will r:r.:.b~bly n11ke tho te~un, a~-d it is expec~ed th1t the Freeh1nen c<as.l will furnis~1 considerable good material. E. T. Grout, physical director of the Schenec t.ady High Sc~1ool, who did s1te:1 efficient work in training last yearf's te~111, bas again been secured as coach. This year season ticket3 go8d for adrnittanc~ to all t~e home games will be sold for $1.o0 eacl1, and it has been decided to charge an admission fee ,of fifty cents instead of twenty-five cents fol t11e game with Colgate which occurs durinf com- mencement week.

Tile Glee and Mandolin Clubs since the Junior Week ,concert 'have kept up their faithful work and have been practicin~ regularly. MawlgPI\ LewLs has arranged a trip to Hudson for the evPn- lng of February 23 and is also trying to arral'lgE-- a date in Poughkeepsie for the night of \Vashing· ton's Birthday. He presented in the last college n1eeting to the students t'he proposition of holding a joint concert with Colgate on the evening of March 30th. So marked was the enthusiasn1 that we are practical ly sure of the concert. Now it }s UP· to every son of Union to \get behind the Glee Club and lDus'n'' and make thi3 branch of our college activities as ,succEssful as possible. COLLEGE MEETING. On .:vronday noon at college_ n1eeting PT'0sident Lewis 2.n nounced that the combined Un i:on anfl Colga~e Glee Clubs would give a concert at the Van Car1er Opera House on Mare·b 13.

He urged the fellows to attend t11e mEJet and hE1 1 J back the relay team which is to run th~' H.amilton rcpresentative3 on the evening of Feb· ruary 2.2d. -------- \ DEBATE WITH COLGAiE, MAY 7. Arrangements 'have finally been eon1pleted for the debate with Colgate. The debate will be held in the Union College Cha:pel on May 7. Colgate, wto, ae~ording to the agreen1ent, has t'he privl· lege of submitting the question, has sent tile fol· lowin :; subject: Resolved, That the United States sh·onld own and control t'ne coal n\Jnes of the country.

(Continued from last week.)~· Balzac has put into narrative form some con· versations that are supposed to have- taken place at the Hotel de Rambouillet. There are \Di~ courses\· u·pon The Novel, Glory, \El-oquence Con- solation, T1l'~ Character and Instructi-on of ·Com- edy, and n'lany other~. It 1nay be OF son1e inter- est to see what was said about glory. \Cicero compo;:;ed a treatise upon Glory, and Brutus one about virtue. They wer·e botil lost in tl1e shipwreck of belles lett.res, caused by the bar t.arian inundation, and I fail to S€e that the loss is 1nuch deplored. A book that would reveal the secret of making gold, or that would l:lhow wi1ere to find concealed treasures, of w'hi ch your RomanJ n1ade a particular study, would he much rnore eagerly Bought after than all that has been writ· ten ~bout glory and virtue. To-day neither one is c·onsidered only as theatrical property, which ex- ists only in appearance, or as Ro.m·an fancies, af· ter which heroes followed, which heroes were in turn but other spectre3 and phanto!l'1S. I have even seen a great man, who, whell told C1at Alex- ander made .alms in talents, belie-ved that Alexan- der had lived no more than he did that Agran1ant or Amaris had lived. The giving of talentB seen1 ed more ridiculous and incredible to him than C1,e ih.alving of elephants with· a single swordstrok·e and ot'her wonders of n'ly-thology.. Every ag.e has it~ faults and diseases, but it must be admitted that son1:e diseasecl are wm·se than others. T~1e disease or our age is foul and vn laiRous.. When the wdrld was young, it was vain, rash and ambitious; now as it appro ache~ Hs end it has become exceedingly a:variciou::; and has an t'he other vices peculiar to old age. Let us :pardon, Madame (Rambouillet), ambition in those eaHed wise. Let us not be astonis~1ed iin the least that they desire to CJlli --·~and and occu1~Y the foremost places.. Let u~ plead their cause .in a few. words. It is needful to giv,e credit and au· tb.odty to reaEon in order that chance n1ay not be ·the ma3ter. It is necessary to be well advise\1, so t'hat folly may not be stronger t:1an wisdoln. BesidEs, extra-ordinary 1ninds ought to know theit own value. They ought to know that the govern- ment is their~ by natural right, and that thpy come into the world eit'her to reign or to counsel kings. Then how does it look to allow the privi leges of heaven and the advantages of nature, • the virtues destined for action and the welfare of society, to perish in solitude and inactivity? To refuse felicity to pet>ple who derrland it of you i~ cruel; to leave the place to miscreants is coward· ly; to love to be badly conducted rather than to conduct is to lack comn1on sense. If I were to write a book upon the subject, as Cicero did, my book would pass only for a com- monplace and bad novel ; I should ran, madan:..e, only among story tellers and retailers of vapor. The honesty of the olden times is tl1e ridieul€ of to-day. I speak t'hus to you alone, madame, who are worthy ·of a better age than our~; who in the midst of the court do not serve the God which the coul't does, who do not poke fun at the Bonnet -des Perses, nor the laurel of the Athenians, wbo d·o not scorn the statues and triumphs of your an- cestors, who ·consider the names of Africans an1 Asiatic::, excellent. You have in your soul all tbe principles of high and ancient generosity, that wb.i·ch th·e Romans and Spa.rtans followed so well that they kept the purity of t'heir laws intact.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 13 White, The eollefje Photo}jrapher. 229 State Street, Near BartJC:Y 9 S ••:Garnet'' Photographer, 1905-4-5-6-7-8 Sp,ecial Rates to U. C. You believe that virtue has· posi.Uon3 of worth and sufficient reward and that glory should be ac- cepted but not demanded; that glory is not so much a debt w'hich tl1e publi-c owe, as an avov:al that they owe and that it is wholly an una void- able protestation; that it i~ not so n1uch a stra1-:~·e light wh:ch comes from w~tbout upon heroic ac- tions, as the refleetion of light fro.m those actiJns, an efulgence sent by the objects that have been the recipient of fh,ose actions. Thus, Jn.ldL1le, nehi1er in JOi.i.r sEntiments nor affections do you separate two thinga that are na~urally united. YaH esteen:.t virtue for the very love of it, and glory for tlle love of virtue.\ In a conver~ati·on upon eloquence Balzac wri~es: \You truly say, sir, that one finds imposture everywhere. Brilliancy of spee·ch d·Jes not alway., :rresuppose solidity, and those words that shine the brightest are often those that we~gh the least. There is a making of bouquetl:l and a turning of veri·ods. I do not dare to call that eloquenc(-l:, whic'h. is completely 'Painted and gilded, which al- ways seems to come from a silly fellow who iq anxious only to dress hii'nself, and thinks only of making himself pretty and w·ilo is consequently better fitted for fetes than conibats,. and pleases more than he serves. Moreover, there n1ay be festivals whose solemnity su·ch oratory would dis- turb, and persons whom it would not phmse. In default of reason and authority, it uses charms and flattery. It is :hollow and devoid of essentialt,, so that it may be clear and reasonant in tone. It is at least more delicate than strong, and having its power limited and its strokes mediurr1, it pene tl·ates no farther than the sense, or at the mo'3t, it touches the exterior of the mind but slightly. Let us say, ·Sir, that true eloquence is ve.ry differ- ent from this tatle in public places, and its style far removed from the ambitions jargon of GreciatJ sop'hists. Let us say, it is an elo-quence of busi- ness and duty; born for com1nanding and ruling; full ·of efficacy and power. Let us sav that it does not give to its words .merely a continuance 0f gracG and beauty as P~Iidi3:s did, but a heart throb- bfng with life as Deda:l1.ts di,d.\ One article of the· Pr.eci,Ense doctrine was that v;o:nen £hould know everything withou.t seerrting; to be learnEd, and tll:.at t1leir conver.:;;a.tion s:1ouU. be appar\..ntly s;Jontaneous and impromptu. Love ·.'vas virtu::tlly bani·sh!ed. from the Ho~el de Ram- bouillet, and a sort of platonic affection took its ~ 'Tlace. Nevertheless all 11hases of love. were dis- ·cussed. The question whether a man should fall ln lJve wE:1 a worr ... an was of .such great n1o1nent ib at it formed one o:f t11e subjects of discourse at the llot€1, between n.1.en::1ge and chapelain. The map of love, d.raw11 by Clelie (Mme. Scl.Jd- e·ry), was long a con.:versational the·me. It cune lo be drawn in this way. One day Herrninius and Aronce were visiting C1elie when Hern1inius said: \I beg you, amiable Clelie, to tell rr.~.e where I an-:1 irl your affections.\ Clelie ( smilin~·)-'Y\Gu are still at Ea1ly Friend- ship, and it will be a long· time ere you get any farther. Herminius (smiling)-1 s'hould like to know, at least, how far it is f,rom Early Friendship to Love. Aronce-In my Ol)inion few people know the map of this country. (TO BlC C'ONTINUED.)

THE CoNcoRDIENSIS VOL. XXXII. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 27, 1909 No. iS ''The Sphere of Religion: A Consideration of its Nature and its Influence UI~on. the Progress of Civilization.\ By Fra.nk ~sargent Hoffm:ttn. Ph. ·n. This book is in so1ne resp€cts a sequel to two of the author's otiler works, \The Sphere of the State\ and ''The 8phe.re of Scien-ce.\ It is a good book to have abouL Aith:ough it is not written osten~ibily in the intere.st of ffu.e Chris- sid:erable sigNLficance to all of u~. Scarcely on€ of. U1e sub-headings in this chapter can bE) Hghi:ly s.et aside as being without relation to the de·mand;:; ofl a liberal edHcatim.L Everybody shou1d seek to know .something a bout the effect upon human progress of such writings as the Chri~tian Sc.rip· tures, the BiiDle of the Jews,. the Avesta of Zoroas ter, tile Koran of Mohammed, the Iliad and the Theogony of tbe Greeks, and even, perhap<s of Mrs. Eddy's \Se.~ence and Health;\ and although tn my humble judgment we could get on perfeetly well tian religion, yet it draws attention to son.te of with a more suc-cinct account than ProfesfSor Hoff· the n.:.ost important features of that faith w:1ile · rnan has g.iv~en u.s of the subject last mentioned it deals at the same time with religion in the (to which the professor has devoted 19 pages ::t3 abstract. All people and nati-ons and tongues against 20 assigned to the Christian Scriptures), huve a religion of some sort. The only question yet as our author seeJD.s actually to hold lVIe. if::i, \How can I so in1prove the religion 1 already Eddy in some estee1n, ~p-erhaps he . c-ould not ~ay have as to make it of the highe.st w·ort~1 ?\ Ther:,e less than he does about that most extraordinary last ·words, quoted fr-mn Pro f. Hoffman's preface, n1ake it evident at the start that the author, whatever his personal preferences or church af- filiations rnay be, is preaching no sermon, is hold· i:r.g no brief for the Christian or any other single f0rm of doctrine; rather is it hh:, purpose ·to point . tr, the more i~mportant characteristics of those rdigi:ons of the world which have been most llrominent in influencing hum.an thought. His treatment of the subject is both psycho- logical and hfstorical; the controversial spirit is conspicuo-us for it.:; ab~ence. This is n0 small virtue of the book; it lends to the work a genu= ir.e ap,pearance of impartiality, and renders pns s!ble the introduction of a large assortment of suggestive and illuniinating material, of value Vi· hether to the specia.Iist or to the .more general and indifferent observer of ll.unan events. It is with plea~ure that one find-s in the table of contents such topics of interest and inquiry as, for example, \Sacred Books and How They Orig- inate.\ This is the title .of Chapter III. Here in sn1all c-ompass is a collection of subjects of ~o~- and very questionable character. Nevertheless. as one glances over Professor .• Hoffman's well-w.ritten. and generally convincin~· page~ on such interest-compelling topics as \Re· Egion the Key to History,\ \What Religion Has tQ Do with Education,\ ''The Church and the Right tl, Property,\ \Hu.rnan Immortality and its Re· h1tion to Religion,'' \T:1le Present-Day ·Conception c ~ God,\ etc., etc., one cannot but wi;:;h. that in the chapter on Mrs. Eddy our Professor of Phil- osophy had exhibited a somewhat truer sense of proportion and a less credulous ~piri t. True, .Mrs. Eddy cones in for .some very apt criticism at the -close o.f Professor Hoffman's remarks oR this subject; yet it is plain to see that the author has been willing to do more than simple justice t.o Mrs. Eddy's teachings, as well as to those cf her contemporary and syrnpathizer, the theo~o­ l)hist, Ma<}a.me Blavatsky; to a somewhat strain:::-.d ap.preciation of tile latter's life and writings (i!!· eluding those of her successor, Mrs. Besant ).

It ts merely a statement (accompanied by IT1UCh illustrative material) of the province of religion in general il1 its psychological relation to human activities and to the development of the :human ra·ce. That the book .takes more account of the Christian than of other religions is, I think, evident. It does this in spite of its .impartiality, and in s.pite als8 of the author's manifest endeavo.r to refrain from striking any unwelco:rr.:e note of denomination!l.l preference, such as might offend the over-sensitive ear of some earnest Protestant or Ron1an Catho- hc believer. Especially instructive among its chapters are those on \Human Immortality and its Relation to Religion,\ \The Present-Day Conception of God,'' ai;.d that chapter which say~, '''Religion exists be- cause man exists,\ and. again, \We mus.t not for· get that religion rs a gTeat permanent reaUty.\ This i:S the c-:hapter entitled, \What Is Reli:gion ?\ It is tile :first and finest in the book, and n:..ay be \ . road with enjoyment and profit by us all, but eb pe~ially as. it ~eems to me, by those who are prepared to place the Old and New Testame:'lts in the van of religious. treatises, and to think of J€sus as the greateBt of religious tea·cher~·.

SI.NEY G. ASHl\IOR.R DR. CADY'S LECTURE. At the last of Dr. C.ady'~ lectures, the country a bout Palestine and Hebron was described. He gave an ovcellent des-cription of the country and said that by going from the top to the bottom of the 'hi~ghest mountain in Palestine one C'oOUld pass through a district where all forms of vegP. table life can be found from the northern fir to the tropical pa1Ir1. Dr. Cady also described hi.s visit to the ancient ·city of .Joffa. Owing to the dangerous rocks even ir ... pleasaat weather, the ships are compelled to cast anchor half a mile from the city and the passengers are taken to land in small ·boats, whiV~· in stormy weather a landing of any kind is im- vossible. While in this city Dr. Cady and his party ob- tained permis~ion from the Sultan of Turkey to er.tter tile burial place of 1nany of the ancient Hebrews. Before entering the ton1bs the party were obliged to remove their shoes as the 'Place w.as held very sacred to the people of the -coun.- try. Dr. Cady considered himself very fortunate in being able to investigate the tombs as but few parties besides his own have ever been granted tile privilege.

THE CONCORDIENSIS BASKETBALL. H am.i Ito n, 20; 'Union, 29'. On Wednesday night, February 17,, the ,Garnet and Blue again It1et in contest o0n tlie l!>asketball court of the Armory. This time it endet3 in a victory for Union and it was a wen deserv~d victory, for the team worked hard. The first half was not characterized by any throwing, and easily obtained and l~€pt th~ lead the ren.ainder- of the tim·e. In this half as well as the first the playing was n::wsUy in Union's territory, although 'When .Hamilton gained th<: ball it was quickly taken to their court. They n~ ade their playing towaFd the basket all the tin1e, while Union attempted more pass~work, :at ttm,es perhaps being to slow in :playing for the basket. ~ev·ertheless, the team played well ar..r:l very good wlaying on the part of either te:::tm. The added anotf1e,r victory to the list. scores kept very even until the last few .minlites of play and the half ended ·with Hamilton in the- load, 12 to 8. The pass work of both tean1s was not very excellent, though per:haps that of Uni<>n a little better in the b~ginning but this did n\t continue through the entire half. The Hamilton five -clearly had the advantage in thetr ability t'\~ throw baskets, but thi.s did not materially in- cr-ease their- score because the playing was most ly in Union's· court. Tiley had a chance, ti01e after tirrie, for the basket but failed in many of tJ.ren1. The half, and in fact the entire game, was very clean, but few f.Juls being callEtd on either side. The .scoring was started by Clowe, and then a moment later Getman made Hamilton·.~ first basket. Coward scored on a foul, and th€n Hoenke after a fine dribble down the court scor~d A.. basket. Coward again scored on a foul Brown added another basket and then Getrr\an scorof)d on a foul. The scoring alternated in this man- ner most of the half, Han1i1ton being a few poinLs ahead most ·Of the time and still being ahead at the end of the half. As soon as the sec~:>nd half started it was evi d<:.nt that there was to be n1ore basketbal! th~n h, the first half. Both teams were working for a victory.

After \Buster's'' baslu;t, Hamilton scored twice, and then the Garnet t(-l~un l~ept scoring until the score equalled and fin1!1y increased over that of Hamilton. At ·every ba~k~t by the home team, the hall resounded with cheer~. and everyone became ent:h usiastic over the pl?..~T­ ing of both teams.

Scudery has given soiDe typical conver ~ations in '~Le Gr .and Cyrus,'' her twelve thou sand nine hundred page novel. The following is a selection .from a conver<:;?,- tion upon coquetry, found in Volume I, page 796: Cleoni-ce.-Indeed you cannot make rr1e b~lleve that this throng of lovers who obey and fo1low Artelinde.-~ Alas,. Cleonice, you go too far! All I do for my adorers favors them and. cannot give tl: em such a thought. ·Cleonlce.-Believe me, I am les.s deceiv~d t:1an you, :for since lovers have been found who have h·op.ed .in the n:ddst of severities and tortures which they have been compelled to endure through extreme eruelty, how do you expect that people whom you heap with favors may not have every poE~sible hope! Artelinde.-No, no, do not be deceived. in the 1Past by that. I distribute my favors too much in order to heap them upon any one pers·on, and i'.

Artelinde.-(Smiling)-1 confess frankly, that [ do all you say and I avow that one of rrly great- est pleasures is to deceive those persons' mind& by trifles, which gives the1n reason to bPlieve that they ave fav()red. Cleonice-But .can you call tnose things trifl~s which make those persons believe they are much et-teemed by you; that they will one day possess your affHcti.an entirely and perhaps your person as well? Cleonice, I fear that if I reveal to yon all that I think, I shall destroy my own empire. For if rou should be en. vious enough to add a little ad- dress to the charms {)f your beauty, I should be absolutely lost, since all my lovers would inevit- ably be your. (TO BE CONTlNUED.)
