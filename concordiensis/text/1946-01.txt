Hod.;:, FOREIGN LANGUAGE SPEAKING INABILITY Elsewhere in this issue appears a stmov as indicated IJy the Dean that \ ... veteraNs at Union Colleg-e find forei.gn languages <md mathematics difficult i11 readjusting \to colleg-e study.\ While tke suggestions as offered of refresher courses and repetition of basic courses are excellent, this difficultr particularly in foreign lang·uages indicates to a large degTee that the methods of teach- ing foreign languages bel'e at Cnion need I'evision and addition. Veterans may find foreign languages l'lifficulot Lut present en- rolled non-vetemn students of lang-uages reflect upon theil' inabiHty to speak a foreig-n language. Perhaps in mathematics the best sugg-estion is repetition of the basic courses since rnost mathematics courses meet dail.1·. But in language study J'efresher com·ses can not be enoug-h to alleviate the situation! Before further comment, let it be said that the fault lies not with the capabilities of the present language department. l'nion College can justly be pro~1d of itself in having a \\'eli trained, intelligent, socially pleasant and otherwise acceptable language in- structoi·s. As ah·ead~· stated the avemge college student of languages is not able to speak, ofte!ltimes, the foreign language which he has studied for four ,Years, ?~lost ce1·tainly an app1·eciation of another· tongue is obtained, worldly litemry masterpieces are read and theil' value interpreted, and the keenest minds profit IJy the tntining offered in foreig-n language study. This inability to speak a foreign languag-e is an accmate barometer of the results of the p1·esent systems. There is no incentive to speak the language once outside the classroom and awa~· from the helpful smveillance of the instructor. By \Yay of suggestion what Cnion College needs sorely is an inc1·ease in the number of weekly hours devoted to language study. Instead of three hours a week, let it l.Je ex- tended to five hours a week and fm· even more extensive study to ten homs weeklr with two hom·s daily. The way to learn languag-e is to speak it as often and in as many situations as possible. The men of this generation are the ones \Vho will relieve the world from its p1·esent sorry state. \Vhether or not the l'nited States assumes the IJurden of world leader- ship which lies befo1·e us, this country quite frankly and emphatically needs students and trained experts who can not only converse in another language !.Jut who can understand the various inte1·naticmal psychologies. l'nion College, which prides itself oH its continual contl'iiJution to the p1·ogTessiveness of this count1·y as indicated by the admirable calibre of her maay sons, caJ.J make further contribution l.Jy establishing- a language house for lang·uage students. Sul'ely the Board of Tmstees can re<ulize the actvisal.Jility of sponsoring such a move. Or are they too far from us'! And it is the duty of the administration since they are adj.acent to the existing situation to convey and impress their convictions on the Trustees. As I walked inside I discovered that I was not alone, there were three librarian:o<, a cleaning woman, someone enoring in an a'lcove in the back, and an old, old, bearded man hunched over a volume en- titled \Karl Marx's Theory of Fren Love.\ However, I soon became b01·ed, because I couldn't find any- thing of any great interest; the place was Iousey WJth books. I turned, intending to leave, when 3 thought came to me, a beautiful, :Jriginal, spectacular thought, the d1·eam of a lifetime. Why not con- wrt the libra.ry into a Music Bar?'? To take a hypothetical case, in our \French House\ students majol'ing in French live and at meal times speak only French throughout the usual mealtime conversation. A French instructor wotl,ld be in residence as proctor to con·ect pronunciations and en- comage the speaking of French. In this way a more sympathetic outlo0k oil French could be obtained and it goes without sayh1g that the mte and proficienc~- in speaking French should increase tremendously. Let me take you ahead to the year 1950 ... The redecorations have been com- pleted, Union College has been ac- claimed all over the country as the number one college of the year. \Union the only college in the world that has a night club in the center of its campus.\ N AVY EWS It is recognized that the colleg·e has many p1·ol.JleH1s with which to cope and overcome in its advance towards the regular two term colleg-e year. Progress will be g-mdual and in 1 ecognition of existing faults. .Jlention must l.Je made of the understaffed language depal'tment. In addition to our language house, there is a need of a Hispanist who will devote his teaching- to Spanish and thereby release other professors to offer more courses of instruction in their special fie Ids. In addition to French, German, and Span- ish, courses in Russian and Chinese should i.Je taught; for it will be to China and Russia that the cmssroads of the world will extend. Both of these countl\ies will occupy positions of greate1· international pl'ominence and to learn these languag-es will prove \Vorthwhile. The generous g-ift of Frank Bailey, '85, trP.asurer of lrnion College since 1901, to endow a chair in Greek, Latin and ancient languages to the amount of $1;)0,000 will take care of the neglect of ancient lang·uages since the start of the past \var. B~· the recognition of the difficulties of veterans in foreign lang-uages and mathe- matics, the administration is taking just notice and perhaps some l'evision and cor- rection is forthcoming. Now for the news of the mem- bers of the Union family, who for better or worse wear that ill-fitted garb so proudly called the Navy \blue.\ The Christmas and New Year leaves seemed to last about as long as a smile on a Spec A's face. But the two Wednesday's which ended our leaves dragged on and on like Navy pay lines. Traveling took up a lot of time for some of the out- of-state boys. The Windy City con- tingent suffered a long, hard trip standing- ;n the aisles, but I'm glad to repor·t they nevertheless were feeling the best of spirits. At last I can tell the story be- hind UCRS changing the time of its \Campus News\ broadcast. As I hear it, Zangari, high ranking member of the junior-braid division of this battalion, got tired of the basketball \dribble\ every night. Thus, in a roundabout fashion, he let Furrer and Milford, the pro- ducers of that bugle call \rag hear of his dislike. Mr. Zangari, it seemf', would rather listen to Spike Jones and his accomplished noise- makers while he dines. Naturally Milford and Furre1· immediately went into consultation with their sponsor, General Electric. The~· ~old the geneml that it would be co!Y!mercial suicide not to foll'ow the ultimatum. The general, being only a two-star general, finally saw the Wil'dom of not fighting the NEW YEAR THOUGHTS omnipotent Zangari. Consequently you may now-if any of you cal!'( get anoth·er station-hear the boys blow their recorded bugle at a new time, long after the Admiral (j.g.J has finished chow. Anyway that's the story as it was told to me. The year 1946 is not so old that we can not add a few words of gTeeting and felicita- tions. 1946 without a doubt will prove a most eventful year. Really great things are in the offing for the future betterment of mankind. Before 1947 rolls around, the United Nat ions Organization will receive its true test, economic and social adjustment problems especially in war ravaged Europe will be coped with, a new pattem for strike settlement in the l'nited States will receive further advancement, and ,,-.·ithout a doubt the world will once again see new improved household conveniences appenr in multifold quantity. Perhaps one of the biggest things to evolve will l.Je the new role which America is destined to play.

Only common op- ponent both teams have faced this season is Columbia, which defeated both Union and Stevens. Compara- tive scores on this tilt give the Techmen a slight advantage since they bowed 28-38 and the Garnet suffered a 34-51 setback. Garry Stauffer's sensational play spa·rked the locals on many oc- casions. He talli·ed 16 points on a wide variety of shots. Dingley racked up 17 counters to lead the scoring column. Only one substitu- tion was made during the tilt and the starting five showed unusual endurance. Union 28, Syracuse 69 The intramu!'al picture remained relatively the same over the inter- vening period .since the last issue of the Concordy. Sigma Phi still dom- inates the Civi:Jian division with the Off-Campus fve in hot pursuit. In the Navy League, A-2, and B-2 retained their positions although each dropped a game to fall from the undefeated ranks. B-3 dropped from third to fifth position, losing three consecutive games. Other- wise, the standings have been faii·- ly stable. There is little glory for the men of Delta Chi Dorm. There are fe\\· plaudits and few laughs. There are few baskets but there is much weariness and a feeling of deep futility. Yet, as we have often noted, there is no dirth of good sportsmanship and these lads are trying as hard at the end of a hopelessly lost game as they were when the score book read 0-0.

Coach 'Whitey' Boehm's charges will be making their first start since before the holidays when they were trounced by Syracuse 28-69. However, they appear to be in winning form again and are expected to .display the same ex- cellent ball ha.ndling which was responsible for a surprise upset over Rochester. The addition of a number of new plays has greatly strengthened Union's fast breaking offense and fine defensive playing has boosted the Dutchmen's victory hopes. Garry Stauffer's fine perfor- mances in recent games and in scrimmages have clinched a start- ing berth for him at right forward, Stauffer won out over Rog Mc- Cormick, regular forward, who s~ill appears hampered by an ankle In- jury received a few weeks ago. AI Dingley is counted on to con- tinue his high scoring ways as he returns to the other forward posi- tion. Dingley's accuracy in long shots is a canstant threat to any and all opponents. Captain Bill Fisher will again tip-off at the center post. Whitey Marks and Dick Thompson are slated to operate from the guard slots where they play an important part in setting up Union's plays. Union 34, Columbia 51 The Garnet's first road appear- ance of the current campaign re- sulted in its second defeat of the year when Columbia's towering quintet handed the visiting Dutch- men a 51-34 beating in New York three weeks ago. Union kept abreast of the Lions throughout the first half and traiJe.d 20-21 at the intermission, but the New Yorkers size spelled its down- fall in the second period when they scored 30 points to the Garnet's 13 to clinch the victory and pre- serve their undefeated record. AI Dingley scored eight markers to take honors for the Dorpians while Herb Poch's 16 tallies led the way for the winners. Union 58, Rochester 45 The Syracuse University cage team maintained its unbeated rec- ord two weeks ago when Union played on the Salt City court and was overwhelmed by a 69-28 tally. With one of the fastest and the tallest quintet in the East, the Orangemen experienced little dif- culty after the opening minutes in running up their sixth straight victory. Unian fought gamely but was behind 11-27 at halftime and gradually slipped further behind as the feature neared a close. One con- solation was that the Dutchmen held the Salt City squad to its low- est ~core of the year. AI Dingley registered 14 points in the match but four of the win- ners were abel to score 13 counters or better. Ludka, six foot ten guard, and Newell, six foot eight center, were able to keep the ball well above the heads of the much short- er Garnet five. Stevens wins have come over M.I.T. and its alumni while losses were dealt the quintet by CGlumbia and American International. The visitors boast of a speedy quintet that hl?;s shown steady im- provement throughout the season. The starting five includes three members of last year's varsity team. Captain Jim Salmon, who starred for the Techmen last year, is again slated for one of the guard posts. His running mate will be Johnny Hanlon. Jumping center on the squad is Red Doll and John Dodd and Dick Horton round out the varsity. Horton was selected on the first team of the All-Ohio squad last year.

Sabine, Vice-President 0f Cornell states: \The book con- tains much material admirably chosen to promote discussion in class. It covers a much wider range of subject matter than most texts in logic, including matter havi~g to do with the interrelation of dts· ciplines. It is directed toward stu· dents intere~ted in social studies. In the hands of a teacher with that interest. it is excellently suited to bridge logic and an introduction to philosophy.\ The Chairman of Philosophy at Harvard, C. I. Lewis, writes: \For the purpose of teaching inductive logic to the general student I thiHk this is the best text which I have ~een. The discussion material is especially good.\ \f have looked through Reliable Knnwlt>dge with the greatest in- terest. It appears to me to have many very decided excellencie~ as a textbook in introductory phrlos· ophy,\ are the words of praise from Glenn R.

Broadcast over WGY, STUDENT ACTIVITIES An apathr toward student activities is evident on the l:nion Colleg-e Campus. \\\e hope that this apathy is not due in any part to ig-norance. \\·e feel, nevertheless. that a clarification of this subject is in orde1·; we feel that if e\·ery student knew precisely just what activities do exist on the Campus, what thei1· functions and requirements, and how ile might go about joining one of the1H,-we feel that if all these facts were better knu\1\!1 a lmge part of this \apathy\ would soon disappear. It is for this reason that we publish below a list of those student activities which are open to all. \Ye hope that every- one will av1til himself of the information given here below, for interest in student activities is a measure of the morale and spirit of a college campus. Hereaftet·, let no one say that l\ nion men lack spirit! 1. First of all, there is The Concordiensis, the student newspaper (which IJy virtue of having control of the editori<ll columns, can list itself first). Here is a truly interesting and worthy activit~·. \\\hich at the moment, will \\·elcome all comers. \\'e Heed replll'tei's, make-up men, feature \\\liters-in short, we can use anyone who has something to offer·. Fo1· further information, see Dick Tontarski, or come to the Student Activities office on either Thursday or Friday at 7 p.m. 2. Then there is radio station l THS, the Concordy's friendly competitor in dispensing the news. For fmther information see Boyd Howe (:-\avy), or drop in at the station's studio in the basement of Psi L' House, just above the :-\ew Chapel. :3. The Glee Club, and Choir, under the direction of Elmer Tidmarsh. If you can cmT~· a tune (and if ~·ou can't, perhaps Dr. Tidmarsh will teach you how) the Glee Club will welcome you with open arms. Rehearsals are held :.\londa~; through Friday in the Choir }loom (basement, t·em·) of the ~ e\v Chapel from 12 ;;)Q to 1 :20 p.m. The Choir, of course, sings fol\ the \veekly Sunday service held on the Campus. Attendance fo1· these services is not olJiigatory for choil· members, out in the interest of good per- formance, every member should take it upon himself to attend as many of these services as possible. In order to make such attend- ance more attractive, the College pays each member of the Choir one dollar for each service attended. \Yhy not drop in at re- hearsal one of these aftemoons, after lunch? He who has no music in his heart is poor indeed. .J. Tl~e Inter- Varsity Christian Fellowship. This organization meets every Tuesday in SillimaH Hall at 6:30 p.m. Its pl!l'pose is to provide L'nion men with an opportunity for meeting togethe1· in prayer and religioHs dis- cussion. Everyone is welcome to attend these meetings. For further infol'ma tion, see Dan Anderson, Glen Pratt, or Vic Springer, or drop in on one of the meetings. G. The A.I.E.E. This organization is com- posed nwstlr of engineering students, Lut anyone is welcome. .:\Ieetings, which are announced individua1ly, consist of talks by men in technical positions on topics of in- terest to electrical engineers. For further information, see J. Vorndran, President. 6. The Chemistry Club. This organization also, is calculated tu interest only one type of student, but anyone is welcome. Meeting-s are held in the Chemistry Building, room 106, Fridays, at 12:55 p.m., and consist of talks by students of chemistry. Field trips are also a part of this organization's activities. For further information, see Orin Hansen, or Fr·ank Witzel. 7. The Band. Charlie .Jlale is sick, but the Band plays on-every evening in \\'ash- bum Hall. If you can play an instrument, here is your niche. For further information, just go where ~·ou hem· the music coming fr·om. You'll hear it, too, if you hap)'len to l.Je around \\'ashlJurn Hall about .J :30 of an afternoon. Walk in. The Editor feels sure that any prospective member who asks for information will not be tt·eated unkindly. 8. The International Relations Club, the next meeting of which will be announced, is an organization whose purpose should be obYious by its name. Professor Dot.).· is the faculty advisor, and Warren Harvey, its l)l'esident. \\' e recommend this organization for those who wish to keep up on current deYelopments in international relations. Drop in at their· next meeting! In addition to these listed activities, there are others, more informal, which the student will discover from time to time. The College Chaplain, C. Victot· Brown, wishes to an- nounce that an organization for the purpose of discussing religious, social, and personal questions will be set into operation as soon as a sufficient number of interested students inform him of their desire to participate. The Chaplain's office is rocm 102, Bailey Hall. Such an organization is needed, we think; therefore \Ve hope that it will soon become active. Students, shov; your interest! might say rather disgusting. mvzslx\ < Gree·k for, 'today I am My only hope now is that the a man'>.

This formidable sounding process is really nothing more than allowing a man to give vent to the creative instinct inherent in him, IJ,v setting- him to some simple creative task, like weaving, or modeling- in clay. \\'ithout at all implying that any student on this Campus is in need of rehabilitation, we wish to suggest that the principle of occupational thempy might well IJe put to use here. Students do suffer from nervous strain, although the,v ma~· not recognize it as an~·­ thing but irritability or depression. A system of education that imposes upon the student such a hideous thing as a three-hom exam must naturally allow for consideralJle nervous strain. It is for the purpose of relieving this strain that we propose the application of the principle of occupational therapy here. Nothing more than a room, which would be open to all, containing the means wherewith to create something, would be necessary. Given a hammer, a saw, some lumber, and a few nails, could not the frus- trated and irritable student \York off his ills by making something? We believe he could. ;:\lodem civilization, to say nothing· of modem education, too often fails to take into account the creative instinct imbedded in all of us. Indeed, the workers at some of our nearby factories often have not the fah~test idea of what they are making-whether it is a locomotive or an electric toaster, even though they are helping to make the very product itself, and touch it every day. This is certainly a shameless blunting of human instinct. Nor do college students fare an~· better. Look at Union. How many of om students have creative hobbies?

Those of us who are back from Anzio, Remagen OJ' Hollandia, those of us still in military uni- form, those who endeavored to keep the flame UUl'lling' through the difficult \\'HI' years here, and those of us \vho have just entered l'nion and are even now uncovering the val'ied joys of colegiate life, all possess one common denominato1·. vVe all have an intense pride in our grand old school, our Alma ;\later, and desire that when you leave here, you may take ·with you a feeling that you have not only enjoyed a colleg-e prom with us, but that you have also shared the many other pleasantries of life on the campus \Dancing from nine to one\ ... and then the moment is dissolved. But it is not lost, because it does not become part of the past Lut of the always, to linger on in our hearts for an eternity.

What more important contribution to Union could be Ested though, than that Kappa Alpha laid the foundation for the Amel'ican fra- ternity system? May I take you back through pspers. If there were only some the annals of Union's history to way to climax these priceless the year 1795? A new college was memories. I pick up my pen, open born, a college that was t0 become my desk drawer, and there shining famous throughout all of Schenec- like a precious jewel is a half of a tady. Oh, it is true that it wasn't bottle of scotch. vety big at first. but it grew and ~------~-- - grew so th· t in the year 1800, its N E w T E 'l E p H 0 N E s student enrollment doubled itself- · . · there were now two students. In this same year Union hired a new deHn. The first dean resigned with the classic statement, \I jest aint able to teach these here fellas how to read, and keep up my reglar business of sellin' hootch to the I injuns. 11 Ho\vever Union's new dean was young and handsome, ••nergetic and industrious. He canre 1 lo Union on his 22nd birthday, and- hasn't missed a day since. Young' ':Jean Garis was popular with his I students and was known to all as , 'Smiley.\ ' ''Smiley\ was constantly looking out for the interests of his two •tude\lts and realized that there w s something lacking in the col- . lege curriculum. After much study ' ~nd experimentation he found that : it was \woman so in the fall of: 1801, . . . \Smiley\ got married. 1\ftet· ten years of married life the dean was convinced that there was rroce to woman than meets the eve. r 1~d he felt that t'his beautiful ohenorrena of nnure should be · made av~ilable to his student body.' What hetter way to do this than to : have a dance? It was to be a real! honest to goodness formal shindig. And so, in the year 1815 Union had , its first prom weekend. The follow- ! i\g- is dialogue t?ken from the ! ~allege records. The spe~kers are ' two of Union's Big Men on Campus.

As we look b\ck through the ages we see girls · in ho?p skirts r nd bustles, we see I tall gtrls a~d short girls, thin girls I \nd fat gtrls, beautiful girls and i Skidmore girls.

But it takes far more than just tele- phones to provide service. It takes cable, central office equipment and many other complex items that cannot be produced and fitted into the tele- phone system overnight. On these things, too, production is steadily increasing. Western Electric, supply unit of the Bell System, is hard at work on the biggest peacetime job in its history. Furnishing materials and equipment to meet the System's immediate needs -and to carry out the System's $2,000,000,000 post-war program- promises record peacetime volume and a high level of employment.

Now, the AYDEEPHIS are sitting back and praying for the Dauntless D.U.'s to corr.e through and do their part. The Sigs, under the coaching of Mentor Harry Hawkes, are re- ported as set and ready to avenge their early season defeat by D.U., thereby stepping to the winner's circle. For the all-important garr;e on Monday, Art Lawtel:HlC and B1ll Mara are expected to officiate. The Navy standings remained static as B·2, A-2, and C-1 continued their winning ways.

Possessing an unusual knack for getting himself fouled in the cru· cia! seconds of a match, AI Ding- ley did it again as he flipped in a brace of foul points in the last three minutes of play to first tie the game and then clinch the tri· umph. In all, Dingley garnered a total of 14 counters to lead the way for the Garnet. Dan Robert· son, stellar Wesleyan freshman center was the outstanding man on th~ court as he played a bril- liant floor game and added 18 mark- ers to the Little Three champion's score. 10 markers. Off to Slow Start The game started at a slow pace and for three minutes it looked as though the underdog Buff and Blue might capitalize on its jinx. Then the Dutchmen began to roll and after tying the count at 2-all steadily built up a lead which they never relinquished. Coach Whitey Boehm substituted liberally and by halftime his charges had built up a 26-15 lead. Jumping into the second stanza the Garnet tossed in 18 counters in six minutes while its opponents were hard pressed to register five. Union reserves entered the fray and managed to outscore the Con- tinentals in a rough and tumble €Xhibition of basketball.
