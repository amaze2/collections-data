Y., FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1964 PRICE 15 CENTS Lockwood Takes Over As Dean Union College has its first new dean since 1947. Doc- tor Theodore D. Lockwood has replaced Dean C. William Huntley, who has been dean of the college for sixteen years. Dean Lockwood assumed his new position as Dean of the Faculty at the beginning of this semester. Maras Loses Grid Coaching Job; Named To Admissions Department Trinity Gradnate Dean Lockwood was graduaterl valedictorian and Phi Beta Kappa from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut in 1948. He won a Terry Fellowship from Trinity to attend Princeton University, where he received his graduate degrees in modern European his- ' tory. Aftet· he t·eceived his doctor- ate in 1952, he accepted a posi- tion as instructor for a year in the great issues course at Dart- mouth. His next appointment wa.s as Assistant Professor of History at Juniata College, Huntington, Pennsylvania.

Hemenway has left Union College to become chairman or the Department of Astronomy and Space Science at State University of New York at Albany. Pt·ofessor Hemenway had been a member of the Union College faculty since 1949. In 1956 he also became Director of the Dudley Observatory. He will remain listed in the catalogue as visiting lecturer. During the first semester of this year, he was on sabbatical leave. Joe Maras, who has served as i head mentor of the Union CeUege i football teams for the past three seasons, has been relieved of that post and made an assistant di- rector of admissions. Maras, during his tenure as coach, broke Union College's three season win drought and went on to compile a modest rec- ord of eight wins, twenty-three losses, and one tie. Maras leaves a fine legacy since only two let- termen from this year's squad are graduating. The sophomores and juniors on this year's team were recruited by Maras. Ma1·as was an All-America at . Duquesne in 1936 and 1938. He then went on to play three years of professional football for the Steelers. But a broken leg cur- tailed his career. After serving in the war he came back to the gridiron to pursue a coaching career at Champlain College. He later coached at Harvard, Am- herst, and Columbia. Inury Ridden Teams After serving as Associata Dean of the Faculty for one yeaJ.', he was named Dean of Concord College, Athens, West Virginia, in 1961.

Among these are Brenden Hutchinson, John Soper and Art Marshall. iation P1·oject with the University of Dakar.

In addition he translated and edited the intro- duction by Jean d'Alembert to the soon to be released French \En- cyclopedia\ of the 18th century. There will be an invitational reception for Dean and Mrs. Lockwood at Hale House this Sunday afternoon.

On behalf of ltis matty friends itt the student body, we extend our condolences to his )larents. Greater Opportunities at State Despite his position at th..e Dud- ley Obsel'Vatory, Professor Hem- enway b~lieved that teaching in the graduate division of a State school would offe1• a much great- er oppo1·tunity in the field.

Dr. Noble To Address Fifth Rally The Interfaith Youth Commit- tee will hold its fifth annual rally on Sunday. Dr. Charles C. Noble, Dean of the Hendricks Memorial Chapel, will be the guest speaker. The Committee was conceived five years ago when discussions among various religions leaders of the Schenectady are'l felt that means of strengtheninr; the rela- tions between religio•1s groups would be desirable. Since it wa.s first started, it has been run by the !Ugh school participants them- selves. Dr. Norman Johnson, Pro- fessor of Religion at Union, spon- sot·s and advi.l!es the group. There is a yearly alternation between Jewish and Protestant speakers. \Altars or Couches\ The topic of the lecture by Dr. Noble will be \Altars or Couches,\ an investigation <>f the various psychological benefits gained from religion and psychiatry. Dr. Noble, a graduate of Williams College and Union Theological Seminary, is author of the book Faith fot• the Future. Am<>ng the points he hopes to elicit will be whether we should assuage our guilt feelings by living up to our moral codes or eliminating them and whether modern knowledge should have an effect on our man- ner of looking at God. The more than two-hundred and fifty ex- pected studettts will split up into discussion groups. Each group will have a high school student as its leader and a Union College student as an advisor. It will be his task to give informati{)n and ideas to help keep the discussion moving. The discussion will be followed by a dinner and an op- portunity for the discusison lead- ers to pose questions to Dr. Noble which the groups have raised. Stronger Ties Formed Dr. Johnson said that the Com- mittee has been very successful in \developing increasingly cordial ties between Christians and Jews.\ One promising sign in the accom- plishment of this goal is the fact that the Orthodox Jews are par- ticipating for the first time this year.

Proof Reader A Fair Test As we predicted last week, the trend against frater- nities is continuing on the Union campus. Only 206 fresh- men have accepted bids to fraternities, as compared with 226 last year and 239 the year before. During the same time the size of the freshman class has increased by about thirty. It is becoming increasingly clear that Union Col- lege is not able to support 17 fraternities. The adminis- tration should start to recognize this fact and make plans for a campus with a sizable number of independents. We feel that a decreasing of both the number of fra- ternities and of the number of fraternity members would be a desirable goal both for the advocates and the oppon- ents of the fraternity s~'st-e-m. At present, a sizable num- ber of students belong to fraternities merely because of ex- pediency. They feel that independent life requires too much of a social sacrifice. The independent must eat his meals at Hale House and the Rathskellar or at restaurants scat- tered throughout Schenectady. On a party weekend he has no place where he can entertain his date unless he goes to an open fraternity party where he may or may not feel welcome. He must resign himself to living in a cell-block dormitory, not in small residential units. It is no wonder that many fraternity men, opposing fraternities on principle, remain in their houses because they feel they have no real alternative. We assume that the strong advocates of the fraternity system would be happier if they did not have to drag this \dead-weight\ around. They would then be able to insti- tute a true brotherhood. Of course, we have our doubts whether such a goal could be achieved, but we think that the proponents of the fraternity system should have a chance to try to do so. Thus, it would be logical for fra- ternity men, as well as independents, to demand equal facilities for non-fraternity men so the true value of .fra- ternalism could be shown once and for all. To provide equal facilities for independents the fol- lowing steps will have to be followed. First, a Student Union must be constructed. We heard much talk about this last year but none this ~ear. We can only assume that our administration is quietly putting the finishing touches on the plan.o;;. Second, better living accommoda- tions for independents must be found. The dorms al'e al- ready overcrowded, and this situation will not be alleviated with the increase in the number of independents in the freshman class. Third, the college policy of favoritism toward fraternities must be changed to an attitude of neu- trality. If a fraternity gets in trouble financially, the col- lege should not carry it along but should give it a reason- able time to get in the black, and then, if the fraternity continues to struggle, ask it to disband. Likewise, the col- lege should not automatically assign three-quarters of the new housing complex to fraternites but should allot the space on the basis of demand. At the present time inde- pendents seem to be in much greater need of housing ac- commodations than fraternity men. If the college takes these steps, we are doubtful about the ability of the fraternity system to survive. We do not believe fraternities have the strength to withstand a fair test. Perhaps we are wrong about the stability of the fra- ternity system. It may indeed be the best type o:f social organization for a college. We will be happy to be proven wrong. Let the fraternity system prove its merits, not continue to exist by default. 1 ~ Letters to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: I enjoyed David Crandall's in- teresting bit of universal history, entitled \'Fraternities - Pro.\ However, I did wish the author had specified, in addition to the \fact\ that the genus Homo Sapiens was gTegarious by na- ture, whether society first began in the valleys of Egypt or the valleys of India. And it was a pity that the author did not cite any authorities in his otherwise authoritative article. The author was especially grac- ious in his condescension through- out most of his article, which made his arrogance at the very beginning seem somewhat mis- placed. For example, I would have humbly begged, instead of spurned, those \misdirected fac- ulty and uncomprehending student 'intellectuals'\ (and I am very glad that Mr. Crandall did not use any stronger language, however, much he wou.ld have been justi- fied) to join the fold, or, if they are outcasts, to come up to the bar and admit their error. Arnold Berkowitz '65 nities are actually weakened by the size of their membership, and brothers are denied the close ties of membership because of the di- lution of numbers. Large frater- nities become loose associations with little meaning for most members. 2) Freshmen are not complete- ly accepted into the college com- munity until a deferred date. Their comparative social isolation, combined with the fraternities' tendency to stress their social as- pects, cause freshmen to form a distorted image of fraternity life. Freshmen fail to benefit from the experience of upperclassmen, ex- perience which only a cynic could discount as meaningless. 3) Fraternities are tempted and drawn by circumstances to em- ploy a mode of psychological brain washing much more dmstic and detrimental in its effect than the infami>us snow-job concomi- tant with immediate rushing.

Directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Gurnar Bsornstrand, the picture is full of extraordinary thrills that collide on several levels of emotion and intellect. Mr. Bergman has achieved magic with his camera and with his soundtrack-lengthy silences broken by music, thumps, and strikings of drums.

February 17 Pierre Mendes-France, former premier of France and an out- spoken critic of the de Gaulle regime, will speak at Linton High School on Monday, February 17, at 8:00 P.M. Tickets for the Mendes-France speech may be ob- tained from Mrs. Stanley in the library. A limited number of free Briefs tickets are still available. Beyond this amount, the price of tickets will be $3.00. February 20 The college community is cor- dially invited to a reception for M.

It is winner of the 1941 New York Film Critics award as best pic- ture. \Citizen Cane\ is superb in its drama and in its photography, which explores new methods to make dramatic action and speech that are not essentially d1'amatic.

It seems that Bergman chose a character that in its fa- miliarity to the people of our cul- ture would convey his intentions and arouse the sympathy neces- sary to make the man a hero. If I have the right intuitions about t.he creative process this idea of Christ-chamcterizing the magic- ian evolved after the film had been in Bergman's notebooks for some time. That is, the concept came in bits and snatches. Why not let so-and-so remark on the wounded hand ? Then the con- cept was .broadened, the hero's character redefined, and the film, still in the thought stage, re-ori- ented to set tlff this character. The religious tone of the hero al- lows for as much mysticism and weirdness as the gothic imagina- tion of Bergman could wish for; it satisfies Bergman's penchant for poverty-it seems like scrip- ture and does not intrude on the plot as it does in the earlier film by the same director, Smiles of a Summer Night. The Theme The theme .of the movie is stat- ed by the characters themselves (the scriptural aspect that I have already mentioned); and the searchers~after-symbols will either dig so deep that they make fooh=~ of themselves or think BergmaP too obvious. Frankly, everyone to his own tastes, I hope that the clarity of a mesage does not de- tract from its truth or impor- tance. Since I think that discov- ery is half of the value of any work of art, I am purposely not going to say anything about the plot other than that it ranges over the entire spectrum of hu- man emotion from ribaldry, to tenderness, to terror. The message of Bergman's Christ is feeling, be it love or ter- ror. And the resistance is that of the nineteenth century scientist who, confident in the explicabil- ity of all things, has lost what Bergman, at least, judges to be the most important and least ex- plicable of all-the emotions of a human being.

Specifically the dean of the fac- ulty will work directly with the division or departmental chair- men on the recruitment and re- tention of faculty. The dean also supenises admissions, registra- tion, special programs, etc. In the well-known case of Eng- lish 12b in the evening division we reviewed the situation of those students whom we had ask- ed to discontinue their enroll- ment; we did permit seniors who had enrolled to continue in the course as they had planned.

Isn't it true at some schools, for instance Rochester, students only take four courses a term and are given additional credit for actually the same amount of hours of work in a course? How do you feel about this? Sometimes reducing the num- ber of courses taken and increas- mg the credit provided for the course can temporarily solve the problem, but I question whether m the long run it does, since pre- sumably the four-hour course is going to demand of the faculty proportionately gl'eater input, maybe additional recitations or longer lab sessions - which in the end figures out in the same way that a three-houcr course does.

The educa- tional Policy Committee made up of members of the faculty, did not think it adviseable to renew I the contract, since it would in- volve giving tenure to Mr. Wine. Librarian, .Edwin Tolan, object- ed to the dismissal, believing it not only unfair to Mr. Wine, but also to the rest of the staff, since no one was hired in his place, this situation may cause an un- due amount of work to other members of the library staff. More Social Activities According to representative Mike Kau11nan, the Freshman Class is in ueed of more college sponsored soctal acttvities, espe- cially in the early fall. Kaufman suggested that the council spon- sor either nuxers with nearby women's colleges, or combination mixer-date dances of a bettet· calibre than are now the custom, durmg tne early part of the year. With deferred rushing, it was explained, freshmen often ha,·e a ctiifJcult time finding social activities during the fall that are open to them. Action Dl'layed Since the I. F. C. is now in the process of re-evaluation the de- terred 1·ushiug plan, 1t was sug- gested that any furtllcr actwn on the proposal be uelayed untll a decis1on on ru~hing t.:ould be made. Also, Pres1dent Mmrison suggested that Kautman study his proposals further.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1964 Ex-Premier Gi'Ves Speech ~ OnDemocra·cy By Bob Stolzberg The Honorable Pierre Mendes- France, a forme1· French pre~ier, spoke Monday evening at Lmton High School in a program ar- ranged Ly the Freedom Forum. His topic was \A Modern Con- ception of Democracy.\ Mr. Mendes-France spoke frol(l his position as one of the world s foremost economists. Throughout his speech there were primarily two themes. One was the need for a unity of action in any coun- tl'y under a democratic form of government; the second, ~he need fol' strengthening the Ut~Ited Na- tions and other internatiOnal or- ganizations, such as the Common l\Iaz·ket. Using France as a guideline, he pointed out that in France e~on­ omic planning in a free soc1ety was taking place. Thus, there are t'ew compulsive measures to force industry and other segments of the economy to do what the planning board thi~ks is, beE!t, vet through use of mcenbves m the' form of tax credits or grants, thev are guided. He saw ~anger in this however, in that this pro- t·ess m'ust lead to increasing the , eomplexities with which a gov- ·1 l'l'llment must deal to the point where only the expert will have the technical knowledge needed to play an acti\'e role in govern- ment, the result being an aliena- tion of the majority of the popu- lation from government. Mentions DeGaulle ln one of his rat·e remarks con- rerning the present situation in France, Mr. Mendes-France men- tioned the Economic and Social Council of General DeGaulle. lJnion Honors •' Whi'e he feels that t.his is a step in the l'ight direction, he is afraid that it can lead to tyranny, as there is no freely elected su- ]>ervisory body above it. As a pos- sible solution to these problems, he suggested the formation of a political system similar to t~e British System. He felt this \ould help solve two problems: . . • , Ratnee first, it would eliminate the al- Ramee~s \Grand Destgn mhost dic~atorial ,yowe~ held b~ Union College will honor Jos-, mark the 169th anniversary of t e pres;dent un er t e , presen c ues Ramee the French the college and its 150th year on constitutiOn, and, second, 1t would eph 1 .~a i' . h d s'g~ed its cam- \the hill \ as many alumni refer li;~~ ~~a~ ~h:ec:!!b~~d~~v~h~~~~= ~~~: 1 :~ F~u~der~s 1 Day .cerem?n·J to the 'present location .of its (Continued on Page 6) ies on Feb. 25.

The station has not broadcast since before Christmas, and there is a strong possibility that radio Union yill not be able to return to the air during the remainder of this school year. The station has had its troubles with the adminis- tration, the Student Tax Committee, and with its own members. If WRUC continues to follow its present course, we doubt whether it will be able to survive another year. The radio station's troubles started when the move of all student activities from Washburn Hall to Old Gym was annoWiced. WRUC had been fllllctioning quite capably as a college radio station for a number of years, but the move t\ncouraged grandiose ideas that had previously been con- sidered only fleetingly. The leadership started to formulate plans for increasing the station's technical equipment, for a type of radio network with Skidmore, for perhaps even becoming an FM station broadcasting to the t\ntire Tri- Citit'S area. These plans might have worked if fate had been kinder to WRUC. However, a combination of mistakes and bad luck plagued the station's operations. The college and WRUC had trouble in cooperating with each other, the result being that the new studios are still not finished, a year after they were supposed to be. At the last minute Skidmore backed out of the proposed network because it was unwilling to share possible extra costs of operating the joint radio system. The Union trustees refused to let WRUC go FM. During the campus planting and pipe-laying of the last few years a number of WRUC lines were cut. The President of WRUC did not return to school for the fall semester. At the beginning of this year WRUC faced an almost impossible situation. This state of a:ffairs was made more than impossible by another chain of events. The Student Tax Committee, doubting WRUC's capacity to :rrm itself, has so far refused to approve its budget. Thus, the station has had almost no money with which to make repairs. The technical department folllld itself additionally burdened when they realized they also had to build a new transmitter because the old one was falling apart. As a result of all the time he put into trying to fix the station, the Technical Director had to drop out of school at the beginning of this semester. The college and the WRUC Executive Board became completely ensnarled in who would replace the broken lines. The Executive Board further decided to adopt a policy of broadcasting rock and roll to try to at- tract back some of the listeners WRUC was losing. In the past two weeks the radio station has ground to virtually a complete standstill. There is only one solution to WRUC's problem. Both the college and the Tax Committee must give WRUC enough money to get back on the air by next year if not by the end of this year. With half of the first floor of Old Gym taken up by the station and with the thousands of dollars of equipment in WRUC, the station cannot be aban- doned. Further, WRUC serves as a worthwhile activity for its members and has hi the past been a real benefit for the college community. If the college and the Tax Committee are to give WRUC the necessary money, the Executive Board of WRUC must in turn make some changes. They have to realize that they are not a professional radio station and very likely will never be one. Their sole reason for exist- ing is to provide special programming for a college audi- ence, not to imitate the slick programming of local com- mercial radio stations. We would expect WRUC to broad- WfeKe!JO ~ f\1CfHff 1 :> '1\)t Gl1 TM.4~ e: ! {\\ .n \, t] . I 4 )-·- ' /.J .. ~ ....................... - \ ./\ L,. ' '1:.11\1- Letters to the Editor To the Editor of Coneordiensis: One cannot let pass the unjust criticism, now circulating about campus, of David Crandall's re- cent article entitled \Fraternities- Pro.\ Indeed, upon a close and hontJst examination, one can onl~· conclude that this clever piece of writing will eventually receive ac- clamation as one of the most clev- er and subtle works of journalism yet to appear in the English lan- guage. Deviously disguised as an argu- ment in favor of our fraternity system, Mr. Crandall's article is actually one of the most biting attacks on this syst~m that has ever appeared in print. The ref- erence to fraternities as having a relationship to the \basic charact- eristic\ of \intelligent man,\ which, Mr. Crandall informs us, is man's \natural\ status as a social being, immediately produces the feeling in the reader that he has heard such shallow attempts at human analysis before, possibly from college freshmen. Instantly Mr. Crandall's cleverness and wit is revealed to one in all its ma- jesty. This very juvenile fixation of outlook parallels almost exact- ly that often manifested by the fraternity man. The deliberate choice of imma- ture phrases and argument match- es quite well much of the behav- ior of the \intelligent \natural\ man-in-fraternity, who exercises the former characteristic through an intense motivation to grab the diploma at any expense, includ- ing education, and the latter through beer-buddies with whom he must eat, work, sleep and en- gage in such creative projects as water-bomb fights and drunken orgies in order to retain what Mr. Crandall so satirically refers to, with a definite tone of sarcasm, as \the element of choice\ over where and with whom one lives, and what he wants to do while there. This latter \pro-argument\ fur- ther endears Mr. Crandall to the fraternity critic. His statement of freedom of living supposedly associated with fraternity life cleverly points one's mind to the situation of conformity of thought, physical existence, and, in some cases, of speech and dress that is presented by Union's fraternities. Furthermore, Mr. Crandall's clos- ing reference to fraternities' ful- filling the needs of individuals in given situations is an open slap at the attitude of many frater- nity men toward the \non-social\ Richmond recluses. Certainly one sees the implication that, if one desires or needs conformity of life activity and partnership in neu- rotic behavior in order to sustain oneself, one certainly should not criticize others who feel no such needs, perhaps, and choose to re- main outside of the fraternity system. Yes, Mr. Crandall's journalistic masterpiece has certainly given impetus to the argument against fraternities. It is only fair to ask, however, that, since both Mr. Tul- ( Continued on Page 4) Ca~npus Briefs February 21 \Citizen Kane\ is being shown in EE 22 at 7 and 9 P.M. this evening.

I'm going to jump.\ \What about your children?\ \S h c too k them with her.\ \But yout· parents ... \ \They're both dead.\ \Well think about your mu- sic, think about Bird.\ \Who's Bird?\ \JUMP.\ On the very \How to Speak Hip, Del Close and John Brent advise the student that it is \lin- cool\ to say you have Bird's axe, or to say that you roomed with Bird. It is even more uncool to ask 'Who is Bird?' \ The Answer This column is intended to :>pare those of you who don't know the answer to the above question the discomfort of jumping or the em- barrassment of being uncool. To start, Bird was Charles Parker, Jr. He was born in Kansat> City and died in March of 1955 at the age of thirty-four. In his short biography of Park- er, Max Harrison wrote that in his short lifetime Charlie Parker changed jazz to an extent that only one man, Louis Armstrong, had changed it before. But the story of Bird is not that simply stated. Parker took up the alto saxophone because as a youth his favorite sing-er Hudy Vallee play- ed alto. Cnlike many jazzmen, Parker was no child prodigy. He once told the story of how he \tried jamming for the first time. It was at the High Hat at Twen- ty-second and Vine in Kansa~ City. I knew a little of 'Lazy River' and 'Honeysuckle Rose' and played what I could. I was doing all right until I tried doing double tempo on 'Body and Soul.' Everybody fell out laughing.\ Parker did improve and worked with Jay McShann's band in Kan- sas City. Parker was deputy lead- er and made important contribu- tions to the band, both in the form of compositions and spirit. His first recordings were made with McShann's band f01• Decca. There are definite foreshadows of his later work on these record- ing;;, unfortunately they are no longer in the Decca catalog. ::'\at·cotics Problems When he was still a young man, Parker acquired an addiction to narcotics, and when he left the McShann band and came to New York it began to cause problems for· him. Despite it Parker made what some feel were the definitive contributions to the emerging in- itial modern jazz form known as \bop.\ He sat in with Monk, Kenny Clarke, and others at Mon- roe's and Minton's, and soon was recognized as the jazzman of the generation. Parker's execution was flawless and his ideas superb. Almost any- 11 1 thing he recorded is considered a I classic. Savoy and Verve have 1 1 each issued a good number of al- bums of his performances and the I Charlie Pa1•ker label, which is '' owned and operated by his es- tate, has also pressed a number of rare Bird sesions. Buy them, dig them, and save your coolness. EXCLUSIVE EUROPEAN FILMS!

One of the factors which influenced him to join Western Electric was the quick manner in which new engineers become operational. During the short time John has been with us, he has worked in several areas which are vital to the nation's communications complex. And with his future development in mind, John attended one of our Graduate Engineer Training Centers where he studied the front-line E:lectronic Switching System. He is currently working as a systems equipment engineer on such projects as cross bar switching and line link pulsing. John's future at Western Electric looks promis· ing indeed. He knows he will be working with revo- lutionary and advanced engineering concepts like electronic switching, thin film circuitry, computer- controlled production lines and microwave sys- tems. He is also aware of the continued opportunity for advanced study through the Company-paid Tuition Refund Plan, as well as through Company training centers. How do you see your future?

Whether or not the college is really inferior de- pends on one's point of view, but the fact is that no one associated with the college feels confident enough to take decisive action on many of the problems facing Union. The trustees, administration, faculty, and students are more concerned with Union's image than Union's substance. We are not sure why this feeling of inferiority and frustration has taken hold. A too powerful and too unen- lightened Board of Trust<\t>S a too timid administration, a too complacent faculty, and a too apathetic student body all contribute to tht> atmosphere, but no one group can be singled out for all the blame. The pervasive inferiority complex and attempts at im- age building are manifested in different ways. We see stu- dents whose chief complaint about Uniort is that its name is not well enough know. To these students the main way of improving Union is to give the public relations office more money to spread Union's fame. Another favorite plan is to develop strong athletic teams so we can at least com- pete in the Little Ivy League, a supposedly obvious way of improving the school's reputation. As editors of the Con- cordiensis and supposed molders of student opinion, we have long ago discovered that the way to argue for the adoption of a new program at Union is to cite similar pro- grams at Amherst, Williams and Wesleyan for some stu- dents and programs at Swarthmore, Oberlin, and Benning- ton for others. The image conscious Union man will always be taken in by this method of arguing. We see students constantly bemoaniug the existence of the fraternity system but not for one moment consid- ering leaving their fraternities to find another social sys- tem. We see students, always criticizing the intellectual atmosphere at Union, never attempting to take advantage of the int~llectual and cultural opportunities that are here. We see a faculty mm·e interested in petty intrigue and a professorial image than in teaching or doing research. We see an administration mainly concerned with the image of a balanced college but doing little to improve the colleg~. either balanced or unbalanced. We see the trustees intent on preserving the image of the Union they attended and uninterested in creating a newer, more dynamic college. We see the Athletic Board interested in the image of Union as an athletic power and not caring if they hurt the coaches they constantly put under pressure and fire. The college may try to better its image by increasing the public relations budget by thousands of dollars, by having faculty committees grow at a geometrical rate, by creating posts for new deans, by firing coach after coach, and by adopting new programs merely with an eye toward Ford Foundation money. All these attempts are doomed to failure. Union's image will change only when its sub- stance changes. With Union's present state of mind it is extremely unlikely for any change in substance. Perhaps all colleges of Union's academic caliber have the same sense of inferiority. We doubt it. Perhaps Union, with its present leadership, will be able to finally come to grips with its inferiority complex and deal with problems of substance rather than continued attempts at image- building. We doubt it. Letters to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: There has been much criticism of the trustees and their methods of running the college. In my opinion, one very important criti- cism has been omitted. This con- cerns the Negro situation. I feel ashamed and embarrassed to state that there are presently only three ~egroes at Cnion. Statistically, this represents ap- proximately 0.25'/o of the student body. What does this mean? Is Union attempting to demonstrate \Token Integration\ in a time when all other colleges and uni- versities are actively opening their doors to Negroes? The ad- missions staff denies this. If this isn't token integration, however, what is it? I feel that the fault lies with the trustees, not with the ad- missions people. They either do not want more Negroes or are afraid to initiate programs to encourage more Negroes to come to {; nion. In the L'nion College Bulletin, it states that The College was founded to unite the educational endeavors of the many different racial and religious groups. It goes further to state that, \No ordinance, rule, or order shall . . . exclude any person of any religious denomination whatever from equal liberty and advantage of eclucation.\ How ran three XPgroes enjoy equal liberty or advantages of education when in addition to the academic load, they find themselves in the position of being the sole representatives of Union's inter-racial or should I say de-segregated policies. I bring this disgraceful situa- tion to the eyes of the readers of Concordiensis with the hope that they will feel stl•ongly enough to confront the trustees and admissions committee and Ca~npus February 29 A concert is being presented by the Skidmore and Union Glee Clubs in Memorial Chapel at 8:30 p.m. Saturday. March 1 A concert of sacred music by the Kirkettes, the Kirk Singers, and the Youth Choir of the First Reformed Church is part of the program of the Community Ves- per Service Sunday. The service will begin at 7:30 p.m. Elmer A. Tidmarsh, Professor Emeritus of Music, will give an organ recital in Memorial Chapel at 4:00 p.m. Sunday. WRUC will hold a meeting for all members at 4:30 p.m. in Old Chapel. March 3 Sports- Basketball, freshmen, Union vs. R.P.I., 6:30 p.m. demand that changes be made in the present admissions policy. Union puts many dollars into in- suring a geographic balance. Why not a racial balance? As a final word, I might add that all three Negroes are gradu- ating without any prospects of being replaced. Then Union can return to a homogeneous student body. Ivens LeFlore '64 To the editor of Concordiensis: I want to congratulate the Con- <ordy on its write-up of last week-end's activities. I think however that little mention was given to the fraternities and some of the fine entertainment they sponsored last Friday and Satur- day evenings. Actually, many of the houses have been sponsoring such sponsaneous entertainment throughout the week, and this past weekend it turned into an all campus event. I have only the hig-h~st esteem for the endeavors of the men of Union. They de- serve a Pat on the back. Arnie Hartman '64 CollegeDilemma Motivated, in part, by a desixe to accommodate a share of the rapidly increasing numbers of college-bound youth, but pres- sured primarily by raising costs and the necessity for improve- ment, small independent colleges are growing larger, declares D1·. Fred 0. Pinkham. president of Ripon College, Ripon, Wisconsin. For many small colleges, this is the first time they havt> bPen ahlf' to raise standards and increase size at the same time. Faced with a choice of size and quality, col~ lege officials must decide to what extent they should expand theil· campuses. Briefs Basketball, Union vs. R.P.I., 8:15 p.m. :Vlarch 5 The Hon. Luther W.

The film deals with the last efforts of Polish soldiers and patriots to flee ftom the destruction of War- saw by the advancing German army. Most of the picture is de- voted to the attempt of Polish un- derground fighters to escape the Nazis by taking to the sewers.

Friday, February 28, 1964 Friday 1 Febrt History Of Jazz: - } t The Jazz Crusade i t , By P: This bein! By Tom Krehbiel ~ the Concor( In the jazz world names are very important. ln order to be accepted as \hip\ one must com- mit to memory more names than are listed on the Playboy Jazz Poll Ballot, and more obscure ones too. As Duke Ellington ob- ser\'ed, a person is square if the guy sitting next to him in a club or concert knows four more names than he does. Ellington noted further that this gives the non-square the right to look down his nose with a flatted fifth at the square. :\1ilt Jackson When the Modern Jazz Quartet was formed many club owners and musicians pre- dicted that the group would fail unless they drop- ped their coop- erative name and billed them- selves as the M i 1 t Jackson quartet. T h i s was, of course, because t h e s e people felt that any new group must be associat- ed with an established name in ~rder _to be cer~ain of a popular fo~lowmg. In t~ts case the pessi- mists were mJstaken. But this has not always been the case. In England, Tubby Hayes and Ronnie Scott disbanded their co- operative group the Jazz Cour- iers to form their own groups under their own names, both of which have been very successful. Art Farmer and Benny Golson gave up the Jazztet to work sep~ arately again. And the Jazz Dis- ciples of Kenny Dorham have long since passed into oblivion, as has the MJT 3 from Chicago. Jazz Crusaders Three years ago four young men cunw out of Texas tempting fate by calling themselves the Jazz Crusaders. Happily, they have been vet•y successful so far and it appears that they are on their way to becoming one of the most popular groups in jazz. The Jazz Crusaders' story starts in Houston where they be- came acquainted in high school. They all continue on to study at Texas Southern University in Dallas. Wayne Henderson, who plays trombone with ~he group, re!ates, \We were playmg every- thmg - opera, and with the Houston Symphony, and dance music, but jazz-wise we were suffering and just had to get out.

Honoi'S Program In an editorial appearing in Concordy on May 3 the newly innovated Honors Pro- gram was hailed as a great step forward in the academic program of the college. A plea was n~,ade that this pro- gram be infused with more substance and direction in the future. In the last issue of the pa- per before the summer recess the hope was raised that the coming year would see a re- vitalization. of Union's intel- lectual atmosphere and a de- crease in apathy among the student body. That issue also school year. The high college board scores and excellent high school records of the members of the Class of '67 seemed to indicate a trend toward the improvement in the intellectual capacities of Union students.

Penetrating A Slav By Rodham Tullhoss On Scholarships Vaslav Nowwejck, long called (according to the dust-cover blurb) the little Shakespeare of the Slavs, has created a highly entertaining novel of gothic weird- ness in Havasmir's Tests, his first work to be translated into English.

He feels, however that athletic scholarships have no place at Un- ion and should not be used to en- tice athletes. He \never accepted\ the idea in relation to a small Coach Bruce Allison and captain Don Vrooman provided the leader- ship for this year's improved wrestling record. The novel has a strange dream- like quality that I can only illus- trate by breaking from my usual custom of withholding the plot. Sequences follow one upon the other with bizarre, blurred con- nections; one feels that one is walking through a city where all houses are the same, and the street signs obscured. Its very unconventional nature makes it seem odd that it could ever be published behind the iron curtain, much less released for world-wide consumption. In Revolt In its corblyantism it is in obvi- out revolt; and its prevelous crimbs strike hard at the regime of his puppet-state homeland. But this is all frills and nonsense compared to what a few quotes will indicate: You are to be congratulated the winner the leader of our noble group among the cold dark and lonesome savag-ery of the him I see in the green silk darkness let no fire and lion tear the soul of penetrating madness the groove the groove oranges and apricots and grape- I Notice the fine obscurity of the transition passages which indi- cate this penetrating Slav's store of wisdom.

Uses Symbols The book concerns a man, or men, designated only by the sym- bol 7z. This person, or persons, is involved in a diplomatic mission to an unnamed African state. This state has given up centralized government for the traditional tribal society and the complica- tions thus IJlaced on a diplomat, or diplomats, are difficult to enumerate. He must live for two days in the belly of a rotting whale to prove his endurance, sincerity, and manhood. He must serve as assistant to a high priest who sprinkles the faithful with the blood of a yet undead cow (this scene becomes highly humorous), and he must submit to perform- ing- dozens of torturous feats to be allowed even a simple audience with the tribal chief. When he finally reaches this step in his mission his mind begins to slip and the results for the wo1•ld, communist and free, are all the more horrifying because they are totally believable.

Its members are at work all over the free world, helping millions of people to progress toward better lives. In India, West Germany, Italy, and in the United States, they're building nuclear power plants, launching the ag-e of low-<.:o.:;t atomic power. In Samoa, they're developing an educational TV net- work to battle illiteracy .. _ while in Pittsburgh, they're working with teachers to help high school students learn more about computers. In Wales, they're putting the final touches on Europe's first computer-controlled steel mill. Near Los Angeles they've Rcored a world first by putting a computer in charge of cement mill operations. In Bi·azil, Pakistan a11d Ghana, they're providing extra-high-voltage equipment for huge dams to harness these nations' hydt•oelectl·ic power. For Malaysia, they're supplying high-power diesel locomotives ... for Norway, a marine engine room to power one of the world's largest supertankers. The members of the \Progress Corps\ are the men and women of General Electric, working to provide the key to progre~s-low-cost electric power and beth•r ways of putting it to 'vork.
