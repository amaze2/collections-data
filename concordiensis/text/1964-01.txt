HISTORY OF JAZZ Page 2 Vol. 95 -No. 13 Rebuilding Slowed By Fund Lack Film Classic Shown Tonight The Idiot, based on the famous novel by Fyodor Dosboyevsky, will be presented tonight at 7:00 and 9:00 P.M. in EE 22. The story deals with a man whom the authm• porh·ays as a Christ Fig- ure, yet is considered by others as an idiot because of his niavite. The novel has been adapted many times bef01·e in many lan- lruages by production companies throughout the world. However, these movies have always been criticized for their ostensible failure to capture the complete scope of the novel. All previous ilcreen adaptations have tried to rondense the lengthy novel into a two-hour production, only to prove further the great diffi- culties in transforming literary art to cinema art. Russians Succeed I .. The Russian version, to be pre- sauted tonight, has been more favorably received by the critics. The most important reai!On for this is that the Russians realized the impossibility of presenting the· entire story on the screen. Therefore, the adaptation repre- sents only one third the length of the original novel. Movie Retains Old Style Unlike the recently shown, Bal- lad of a Soldier, this production is characteristic of the old-style, dramatic Russian acting. The viewer is also given good shots of the Russian countryside, rare- ly seen by the American audience. The movie, produced in 1961, is enhanced by spectacular color photography. Dr. George B. Raser, associate professor of French and Spanish at Union College, has written a hook on Paris which has been published by a French firm. The book, \Guide to Balzac's Paris,\ is an analytical subject index of more than 7,000 import- ant references to Paris in about 200 novels, short stories, plays. histories, studies, pieces of cor- respondence and fantasies by Honore de Balzac. WRUC to Go Rock'n Roll Thomas Krehbiel has announc- ed that this Spring WRUC will undertake a new programing pol- icy. At their meeting Tuesday, the braintrust of the Union radio station decided to convert WRUC into a predominately rock-'n'roll station. A Responsibility Krehbiel described this \appar- ently irresponsible\ change as be- ing the only intelligent thing a radio station in WRUC's position could do. Although Krehbiel is personally opposed to the teen- age version of music, he main- tains that it must be broadcast to satisfy the station's responsi- bility to its Iisten,ers and to its sponsors. The president of WRUC did however reserve Friday and Sunday for special programs mo1•e to his liking and other popular shows from last year such as the Knowledge Bowl. Concerning the mechanics of the station, Krehbiel indicated that WRUC has closed down un- til after finals. Dm·ing this time new wires will be laid that will bring radio coverage to tl'e whole college, from the Lenox Road fraternities to West College, A.F.R.O.T.C .

Proof Reader The Editorial Board of the Concordiensis, on behalf of the student body, extends its deepest con- dolences to the family of Dr. Myron M. Weaver on his untimely passing. Hope For The Future President Davidson announced at the All-College Council meeting last Wednesday night that the college is considering applying to the federal government for a grant to construct buildings designed for the sciences and modern languages. This money is made available under the terms of a recently enacted law that also stipulates that enrollment must be increased in order to take full advantage of the additional classroom space. We compli- ment President Davidson for his speed in arranging an interview with a federal official to discuss the grant which could be of tremendous benefit to Union at the present time. By coincidence it is precisely a language building and a science building that were planned as the next steps of Union's development program. These buildings would in all likelihood be \satellites\ of the Schaffer Library. We also would guess, on the basis of the size of this year's freshman class and on the statements of some members of the administration, that the college has been planning to increase its size. The government grant would thus seem ideal for Union at this time. Obviously, some problems would have to be faced if Union were to receive the grant. There would be the possi- bility that the admission standards could not be maintained at their present level if the freshman class were increased by fifty or more. Further, the college would have to find additional durmitory space for these extra students. At present a residential quadrangle is being planned, but it will be filled mainly by three fraternities whose present houses will be razed. Various solutions have already been proposed for these problems. Some people have suggested that now that the vast numbers of \war-babies\ is reaching college age Union's standards will inevitably go up because of the increased demand to go to a good college. President David- son has also proposed that Union accept a number of junior college transfers to the upper two classes. We remain skeptical on both points. At the same time that more stu- dents are apply to college, the statea and the federal gov- ernment are providing more classroom openings. Union has no guarantee that superior students will flock here because of the sheer weight of numbers. Similarly, we feel that although junior college graduates will be turned out in greater numbers the vast majority of them will not come up to Union's standards. We cannot expect realistic- ally to add more than a few junior college transfers to our student body. The only way to insure the quality of the student body is to make changes in some college policies and to institute some others. First, accept the best qualified ap- plicants regardless of race, religion, geographical area, and perhaps sex. Second,. the increasing of faculty salaries and the strengthening of departments. weak in quantity and quality should be given priority over all other financial programs. Third, a vigorous revision of calendar and cur- riculum should be undertaken to insure that Union stays even with or ahead of current educational changes.

In such a quintet the instruments featured are hetero- geneous, producing sounds which rely upon different principles. Each instrument is distinct and the individual musician acquires his own character instead of per- forming in chorus. Outstanding Performers This year marks the first time in many years that a group of such a high calibre has been feas- ible at Union, since it is rare that such skilled musicians are both available and willing to play together.

The Russians have not at- tempted to get the . whole novel on the screen but have instead carefully transcribed the first third or so.

Excellent OpJJortunity The Union Wood Wind Quintet provides an excelent opp01•tunity for qualified musicians because it enables them to participate in a chamber group rather than a large orchestra. Working in such small numbers, the individual members are able to progress further, play more works, and can more readily achieve their po- tential. The future plans for the ensemble are not quite definite, but it is expected that it will con- tinue to play with the orchestra or with other small groups such as the Brass Choir. In their first three performances this year the efforts of these musicians have been warmly greeted by enthusi- astic audiences for their sensitive, artistic achievements.

If these steps are followed, the proposed government grant can be the starting point for the creation of a larger, more diversified, more excellent college. If Union merely accepts the grant, accepts seventy-five more students a year, and accepts the current policies it is following, Union will become a physically well-endowed example of educa- tional mediocrity.

Chris- tian's greatest c o n t r i b ution. however, was to popularize the guita·r as a solo mstrument. Al- though he v.:as providing a steady choral background to a solotst, as was common in those uays Charlie als0 became adept at playing single line solos in b1e manner of a saxophone or trum- pet. This melodic single line sort of soloing became the main use of the guitar in jazz and remains so today. Joins Goodman Charlie Christian was born in Texas and raised in the Okla- homa blues belt. It was only natural that he should become in- terested in the guitar. John Ham- mond, jazz's greatest talent scout, heard Charlie during his apprenticeship with local and ter- ntory bands and recommended him to Benny Goodman. The swry goes that Goodman almost didn't even hear Christian play. Charlie walked into the first re- hearsal in his best provincial out- fit: tan suit, white shoes, purple socks, and yellow shirt, and Good- man was about to throw him out then and there. Fortunately, the other men in the band persuad- ea Goodman to give the kid a chance. He did, and Christian had a job. For two years Christian played and recorded extensively with Goodman. During this pe- riod he recorded \Solo Flight\ with the Goodman band. This number features Christian's gui- tar all the way through, except for a short solo by Goodman, and EXCLUSIVE EURO.PEAN FilMS!

The Garnet hoopsters fell short of M.I.T. in the finals of the vacation tourney, losing to the Engineers 67-61 after drubbing host Sir George Williams College 81-7 4 earlier the same day.

This put Un- ion ahead 14-11 and set the stage for the dramatic climax.

Garnet Draws Bye Due to a scheduling foulup, five teams wound up accepting invi- tations to the Canadian two-day tournament, and the Dutchmen, drawing a bye in Friday night play, entered the finals with but six hours rest after a high-scol·- ing afternoon contest. Captain Toby Lupstig's early buckets helped Union to an early 16-1;:: lead over M.I.T., but 7 consecu- tive points by the Engineers' Bill Moter put his squad ahead to stay. M.I.T. held a 28-22 advan- tage at intermission. In the sec ond period junior Gary Brown':;. hot hand kept the Dutchmen within six markers of the lead- ers until, with 12 minutes re- maining in the game, a Union gamble failed to pay off when the Engineers pumped in four straight outside shots to break a Garnet zone defense. M.I.T. main- tained a ten point lead until the waning moments, when field I('Oals by Brown and Lustig nar- rowed the gap to six. Motor led the Engineers' scoring with 24 markers while for Union Lustig tallied 17 and Brown 16. 1 n the afternoon contest Lus- tig also got his squad off to a strong start, scoring 11 of Un- ion's initial 12 points. After two minutes the Dutchmen held a 7-1 edge, and were successful in ex- tending the lead to 28-14 with ·1:30 left in the first half. At the half Sir George Williams had nibbled away at the lead, but Union enjoyed a 36-26 advantage. The Geo1·gians' Warren Sutton exploded early in the final stanza, !lipping in 10 quick points and pacing his team to a 43-43 tie after six minutes of play. The talented Sutton, who hit for 29 of his 38 points in the second half, kept his team ahe :1rl for several minutes until, with 9 minutes re- maining, sophomore Al Hrdlicka hit for both ends of a one-and- one free throw to put Union ahead 57-55. Captain Lustig quickly hit for four ~traight two- pointers and from there it was tlle Srhenectadians' game. The li'fi\ center wound up with 29 points and 24 rebounds against the Georgians. Lustig, Brown All-Stars Both Lustig and Brown were named to the Tournament All- Star team.

High men for Union were Lustig with n and Rivkin with 13. Williams Too Strong The Ephmen of Williams Col- l<:ge staved off an early Garnet upset bid to whip the Dutchmen 68-54 on December 16. Gary Brown spurred the early charge with 8 of Union's first 10 tallies, and at one time Union enjoyed a seven-point margin, but in the end Williams' height and polish made the difference. Kevin Shee. han sparked the victors with 21 points. Lustig's finest single perform- ance came in Union's 85-64 past- ing o:f Middlebury College at Middlebury. The able senior pour- l'd in 37 points, only 5 fewer than the Union record, before leaving the game to the reserves. There was never much doubt about the contest, as the Dutchmen sprint- ed to an early 26-4 advantage. At one point the Middies threatened, 3Jicin2; the deficit to 5. but the first team re-entered the game to restore order. Gary Brown was sernnd-high scorer with 17. Rebound Record Lustig sets a Union College re- bounding record each time he hrings one down, and has amass- ed 168 in nine games this year for a redoubtable average of 16.7 pet• game. This average was high enougl: to place him eighth in F1mall college competition accord- ing to statistics published by the NCAA. Junior John Clover has Wilford H.
