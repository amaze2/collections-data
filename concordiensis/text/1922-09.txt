A man familiar with the princi- ples of combustion and heat radiation makes experiments which indicate desirable changes in design. That is research. I You want to make a ruby in a factory, a real ruby, indistin- guishable by any test from the natural stone. You begin by analyzing r.llbies chemically and physically. Then you make rubies just as nature did. Your rubies are the result of research -another type of research. While melting up your chemicals and experimenting with high. temperatures, you begin to wonder how hot the earth must have beenmillions of years ago, and what were the forces at play that made this planet what it is. Your investigation leads you far from rubies and causes you to formulate theories to explain how the earth, how the whole solar system was created. That would be research of a still different type. Research of all three types is conducted in the laboratories of the General Electric Company. But it is the third type-pio- neering into the unknown-that means rnost in the long run, even though undertaken with no practical benefit in view. For example, the Research Laboratories of the General Elec- tric Compan.y are exploring matter with X-rays in order to dis- cover no~ o:q.ly how the atoms in different substances are arranged but how the a:toms themselves are built up. The more you know about a substance, the more you can do with it. This work may enable scientists to answer more definitely the question: Why is iron magnetic? Then the electrical industry will take a greater step forward than can be made in a century of experime:nting with existing electrical apparatus. You can add wings and stories to an old house. But to build a new house, you must begin with the foundation. Ge.ne.r .7...__ .... e ct.ri c Co_ GeneniODlce any Sc:henectad;v, N. Y. 9S.WSHD 5

It will pay you to listen to this music ALL over the country the whistle is blowing for 1\1.. the kick~off, the start of that great game~ another college year. Beonyourtoes when the whistle blows. A good start will carry you well on toward your goal. Let the football candidate start by working away till his muscles ache from bucking the line. Let the aspirant for manager put in careful study of his team's needs, always eager to help -arranging a trip or carrying a pail of water. Let the publications man be alert for news and tireless m learning the details of edit01·ial work. Whatever activity ~ou come out for, crowd a lot of energy into these early Fall days .. And if a good start helps win campus honors, it helps win class room honors, too. The sure way to be up in your work is to aim now for regularity at lectures, up~to-date note-books and particular attention to the early chapters oftext-'bool\:s, thus getting a grip on the basics.

A stove bums too much coal. A man familiar with the princi- ples of combustion and heat radiation makes experiments which indicate desirable changes in design. That is research. You want to make a ruby in a factory, a reaP ruby, indistin- guishable by any test from the natural stone. You begin by analyzing ru hies chemically and physically. Then you make rubies just as nature did. Your rubies are the result of research -. another type of research. While melting up your chemicals and experimenting with high temperatures, you begin to wonder how hot the earth must have been millions of years ago, and what were the forces at play that made this planet what it is. Your investigation leads you far from rubies and causes you to formulate theories to explain how the earth, how the whole solar system was created. That would be research of a still different type. Research of all three types is conducted in the laboratories of the General Electric Company. But it is the third type--pio- neering into the unknown-that means most in the long run, even though undertaken with no practical benefit in view. For example, the Research Laboratories of the General Elec- tric Company are exploring matter with X-rays in order to dis- cover not only how the atoms in different substances are arranged but how the atoms themselves are built up. The more you know about a substance, the more you can do with it. This work may enable scientists to answer more definitely the question: Why is iron magnetic? Then the electrical industry will take a greater step forward than can be made in a century of experimenting with existing electrical apparatus. You can add wings and stories to an old house. But to build a new house, you must begin with the foundation. Generalf)Electric General omce cOlD p a nv Schenectady, N. v_. \. • 95-605HD

On Entrance Blanks The success of Union College gt.,.aduates in business, and the excellent repu- tation which Union has attained did more than any other thing to bring the class of 1926 here. Reasons given by the freshmen on their application blanks show that in many cases the students had known graduates in their home towns, and · felt that the ability shoWtl by these men was the result of careftil preparation at Union. A glance through the blanks discloses scores of dif-ferent reasons, hoW- ever, ranging all the way from family connections with the institution to the fact that letters received from the college officials had been extremely friendly in tone.

For example, the Research Laboratories of the General Elec- tric Company are exploring matter with X-rays in order to dis- cover not only how the atoms in different substances are arranged but how the atoms themselves are built up. The more you know about a substance, the more you can do with it. This work may enable scientists to answer more definitely the question: Why is iron magnetic?

The capable man \vill always be requested to do more than he can do well. The college man must learn to say i'No\ to certain un- derg-raduate honors and attendant popularity, in order that he may be more thorough and obtain real benefit in what he does undertake. This is the age of conce11tration and specialization, and the lesson oi the times needs to be applied to college activ:ities. THE SCHOLARSHIP CUP Alpha Gamma Phi has won the Berg scholarship cup for the past year with a group average almost two and a half points higher than that of their nearest cbmpetitors. Last year the same local group was for the first time declared eligible to compete for the scholarship cup, and at that time they !eel by an even greater margin. The fact ~hat they have such a high standard of scholarship and that they have won the Berg cup both times they have been allowed to compete against the other fraternities on the hill--that should be a matter for congratulation. The Alpha Gamma Phi iraternity deserves a great deal oi commendation as a new organization that has succeeded in putting the emphasis on scholarship. The Alpha Gamma Phi fraternity was organized here in the fall of 1919. They have rooms at present in the sections and have a chap- ter roll oi 13 men. There is however, a very partinent. question that the Alpha. Gamma Phi must ask themselve.s. Do you feel that you have gained anything irom the fact that you are an incorporated body of men- do you feel that your scholarship a:verage ·has heeri benefited by the fact that you are living together in .frater:nity bonds? Or could you · Clo exactly as good work as individ.ual students without the help of fraternal organizatiqn? Is there anything of mutual assistance in the purpose of your organizations? And th.en there is the question of W.-hether or not you have any timtual Interests in the college besides your scholarship activity;_. A college fraternity lnttst have representative interests and attract re- presentati,>\.e men. needs.

That · would be research of a still different type. Research of all three types is conducted in the laboratories of the General Electric Company. But it is the third type-pio- neering into the unknown-that means most in the long tun, even though undertaken with no practical benefit in view. For e~ample, the Research Laboratories of the General Elec- tric Company are e~ploring matter with X-rays in order to dis- cover not only how 'the atoms in different substances are arranged but how the atoms themselves are built up. The more ' you know about a substance, the mo~e you can do with it. This work may enable scientists to answer more definitely the question: Why is iron magnetic?
