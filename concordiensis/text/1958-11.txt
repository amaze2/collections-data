GOOD ' EVENING, HAPPINESS Sitting in the hotel bar, I felt a quick pain as I realized everything was nothing. Also, the waiter had put an elbow in my eye as he served the beer. It was teeming rain outside. Later perhaps, with luck, there would be a tidal wave. I began to sob happily. \Stop crying in your beer,\ my father said, moving my Schaefer. \It's your kind of beer-real beer.\ But was it? Was anything mine, or his, or anybody's? We had been coming to Atlantic City too many seasons. Just me, my father, Annette, Yvette, Babette. I was bored. A proud, frail young man approached our table. My cheeks grew damper than ever. I was in love again. \I see you drink Schaefer, too,\ he said to me . .,Do you know why experts call it 'round'?\ I shook my head, sailing tears about the room. \Of course,\ my father interrupted, \round means a smooth harmony of flavors.\ I wanted to kill him. My young man's dark-circled eyes grew sad. ~'To your kind of beer,\ he said, \all liquid gold and capped with snow.\ My father raised his glass to return the toast, but I quickly pushed ; him over backwards in his chair. ''To your kind of beer,\ I said, my voice alive with ennui. We clinked glasses, and then he was gone. And I'-was all alone again, sUITounded by people. But the clink of the glasses of Schaefer, ah, that is my bitter- sweet treasure. So each evening, when the Schaefer comes, after the pain of memory, after the waiter's elbow, I say, \Good evening, happiness ... Good eve- ning, Schaefer.\ And then I cry . THE F . & M .

A: There 'is absolutely no truth to this rumor. We have tracoed the tale back to Union College in Schenec~ady, N. Y.

Graduation N ()tice In addition to athletic programs, ext1racurricular acti'v- ities, social life and other \fringe benefits,\ few person_s would disagree that the main purpose of -colleges and um- versities is to promote higl1er education. Even at _sehoo-ls which enjoy- national recog-nition for ~chieving ~~~h de- grees of acade):Ylism, moreover, a conb_:r..u?u:; stnvmg to improve both academic standards and md1v1dual student responsibilities must remain a goal In recent years Union has taken a numlber of steps toward these goals. Under the general heading of i~­ proving standards, tht; College has established ~he ~h­ phalet N ott Scho-larships and has inau_gu;rated maJOI'. f1e~d examinations or senior theses; the unhnu.ted, cuts po-hcy IS a factor in promoting individual student :responsibility-. Many other actions tow·ard securing the twin goals of higher standards and individual responsibility rna~ al~o be cited, however. In the next few weeks -theO>neord1ens1s intends to include on this pa.ge a series of' suggestions con- cerning this issue. A partia.llist of to:pics to be considered includes cumulati.ve indices; a revision d the grading sys- tem, rewards for attaining Dean's List, fll'e-requisites for upper class courses and fina) e:xaminatiollos. The Concordi- ensis sincerely welcomes comment on thes-e to:pics from any member of the College community. * * The p1·esent system or require.ments for g1·a~u.ation is one which we feel has long- been m nee<l of revisiOn. As stated in the Union College Bulletin, \the minimum index fo1· Good Standing in the first and sewnd semesters is 1.300 · in the third and fomth semesters 1.400; in the suc- ceedi~g semesters 1.500.\ Students not attaining the minimum index are given s~holarship warning, or, in severe cases, special warning. Yet being placed . on warning .li~ts imposes no penalties on students sa.ve for some a<;tl~1ty limitations and exemption irom the upper-class unhm1ted cut rulinO', except that those people who ~regiven special warning 'iuust achieve at least the minimum index of his class at each final marking- period in orc:ler to remain in college. · In effect, therefore, a student may remain on scholar- ship warning for most of his college career, and/ or be graduated from Union with an eighth semester inaex calling for scholai·ship -warning, providing that he obtains the required number of Cl'edit hours. Because of these loose requirements for graduation students may remain at Union Wh() lack either the desire or the ca.pacity to devel0'p a minimum standard of scholastic achievement. We do not suggest that students wh:o do not achieve their clas~ iru:lices be categ()l'ically droppecl. from the school We do wonder, however, if there is roorn for those who habitually fail to show a<lequate prof]ciency in their studies. , One method by which the results observ~d at Union may be circumvented is to establish a minimum cumulative index requirement for graduation. Under_such a policy, students who have not obtained the presetibed cumulative index will not be graduated. Among the consequences of such action will be the elimination of the tendency to do as little work as possi·ble for the first seven semesters and \goof-off\ co-mpletely in their last term. Tile high academic standards and reputation o:f Union College thus will not be impaired by the graduatio-n of unqualifia,d students. The Coneordiensis pro])oses, ther,efo-Te, that a mini- mum cumulative index ·be established by the• Administra- ·tion. We suggest that said index be between 1.500 and 2.000, or if the Administration thinks it c:!esirable, differ- ent index requirements for students may be established oli. the type of degree they will be awarded. Obviously this systern could not be applied to students n()w enrolled, since an unfair handicap would be placed befo1·.e those stud'ents who fall intO' one of the w.arning categmies. Such a sys- Uim should definitely be considered for -the Class of '63 and su·bsequent classes, however. The aca..demic standal'd-s of Union -are at stake. friday,.

Student Council Committee Viewed By Jerry Finclte This is the first of a series of articles by Student Council Com- lliittee chail'IDen explaining the function of their committees. Mr. Finclte is chairnian of the Social Calendar Committee. La;st year the Student Council saw the necessity of formulating a definite system for setting the dates oJ; prom weeltends as well as for giving all campus organi- zations the chance to bid .for the sponsorship of these proms. As a result tile Social Calendar Com- mittee :was ''established by the Council. This standing committee recommends to the Council dates for the three weekends in the next school year, and upon Coun- c'il approval of these dates the Committee publicizes .them to various adm'inistrative offices and to neai\by women's colleges. The purp~e of this is to give the Ath- letic Deparbnent t·ime to build a favorable home athletic schedule around each weekend and to pre- vent our proms ofrom coinciding with those of Sk'idmore and Sage, as happened -last year. Thus dates have just been set 'for the school year 1959-60. The Committee also appoints.a certain day in w'hich b'ids ·are to ·be received from groups desiring to run t·hese weekends. These bids are ·consid·ered ·by the Student Council and, in cases where there is more than one •bid for a week- end, the weekend tis awarded on the basis of which organization presents the most favorabl-e plans. and budget. 'l'hus the Student Council 'has awarded Spring Week- end to the Junior Class, as has been the case in the past few years. No Bids Received As yet, however, no bids have been presented ifor Winter Week- end (February 27 and 28, 1959). The deadline for these bids was to have been the last meet'ing of the .Student Council but has been extended to the next meeting which is this Tuesday night. If no bid is received at that time the Council will have to dec'ide whether to run the prom itself, whether to let a private group of individuals do it, or whether or not to have a Winter Weekend this year. A final function of the Soc'ial Calendar Committee is to try to impress on organizations that ·are bidding for weekends that plans for a prom are not traditional and not..,changeable. In other words, the Committee tries to keep prom weekends from •becom- ing static. · 1 ack-in-the-Box By Paul Freundlich This week I step off my soap- \Don't build· castles in -the a:ir, box to render single 'honor to one To~p. ... \ of the great though unjustly for- \I shall not oppose your wishes, gotten ·craftsmen 'Tom,\ said Mrs. Nelson gravely, of A m e r i c an \though it will be a sad day for prose.

But wherever these engineers are located, they share in excit .. ing assignments that stem from our job as manu- facturing and supply unit of the Bell System. Since our work is geared to a continual demand for more and petter telephone equip- ment, Western Electric engineers are constantly exploring relatively new technical fields. Some current examples: electronic switching, minia- turization, microwave radio relay, semiconduc- tors, automation. They also pioneer in working with metals and alloys, raw materials, testing devices, chemical processes and the like. Added to challenging assignments like these in production techniques and processes is our nation-wide distribution job. Here, engineers have key roles in devising systems for the supply and repair of telephone equipment. Elsewhere, telephone central office equipment is installed in . thousands of cities and towns each year using tools, test sets and methods devised by Western Electric engineers. They also work with our put- chasing people in buying the things needed by the Bell System, And they are responsible for engineering those defense. projects assigned us by the government because of our specialized - . experience. Ex:ample: the U. S. Army's Nike guided missile systems. ' . To help our engineers keep !ibreast of tech- nical advancements, we recently set up three special f'ull~time, off-the-job study centers- in New York, Chicago and Winston-Salem, N. C. Here Western Electric engineers delve into such subjects as computers and semiconductors. This kind of training helps to insure professional growth. What's the future for the management-minded Western Electric engineer? Consider these facts: 55 % of the college graduates in our llpper levels of management today have engineering degrees •.. in the next ten years some 7, 000 key posi- tions will have to be filled by newly promoted people, engineers included. · Western Electric technical fields include mechanical, electrical, chemical and civil engineering, plus the physi«:al sciences.
