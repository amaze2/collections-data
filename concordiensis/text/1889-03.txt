VoL. Xifi. UNiON C'OLLEGE, MARCH, 1889. No.6. LITERARY. ''Polling.'' No fellow likes to poU. I think that tnay be laid dovvn as an universal n1axi1n. ·I n1ean no fello\v whose tastes and likings are in a. natural or nonnal condition. T'here are son1e, vvho by long tnl.ining or hy force of circun1stances, con1e to take an actual delight in polling, but jt is an acquired appetite just ns truly as a young lady's fondness for pickled oli,~es or your enjo_yn1ent of your after-dinner cigar. Of course sotne tnen do bring then1selves to enjoy tbe an1ount of poll- ing they get through. 'There is a feHovv in our section \vho polls desperately hard. \..,.ou \vill seldorn find his light out before one or two in the n1orning. And the other day, when I spoke syn1pathetically to hin1 of his hollovv cheeks and sunken eyes, he glanced up at the glass \vith an unquestionable look of pleasure in his f£tce. \V e all know the feeling. We begin our polling with a desire for knovvledge and a longing for distinction, and gradually there creeps oyer us a feeling of the sacri-fice we are n1aking. We look at the n.1erry fellows on the ca1npus, and never did their sport lool<: so enticing, never did the day look so bright 'or the sunshine so alluring, and we turn regretfully back to our books with an agreeable thought of how tnuch we are deny- ing ourselves. There is a certain pleasure in thinking one is polling tren1endously hard in tnaking a great deal out .of one's self, but it is a rriorbicl, abnorrnal pleasure. It is a feeling which threatens our best stu- dents in college and perl1aps, for a certain class of tnen, it is the greatest danget. For it is this \vhich n1akes the \\vorld look so askance at the col- lege graduate, this which n1akes hitn a prig. \Ve often hear it said of son1 e young fellovv ~ '\ He is dreadfully conceited!\ And it all cotnes of the feeling that he has denied hilnself so tnuch. He gets to thinking that he deserves a great deal. He forgets that pain and toil are only ennobled by the end to be attained by thetn. The sad satis- faction he felt vvhen he he~lnl the shouts of his con1panions on the can1pus and yet kept Hnnly to his Liddell and Scott \\·ith the resolve he would not go out ie spite of his longing, has gro\vn info an absolt1te enj oyn1ent of his O\Vll suffering. He takes prides in telling his friends what a laborious, self-clenyi ng person he is. I suppose we ought to feel thankful that in a \vorld where so little can be 'lccon1plishecl except by sacrifice, there is a certain satisfaction in the sacrifice itself; but it is a very dangerous feeling. We are so likely to forget that there is nothing grand in piling sufl'ering upon ourselves 1nerely because we hate suffering, n1erely because we find certain tnorbid pleasure in yielding to \Vh~t we dislike. vV e have no right to add such use- less pain to our lives. Self-denial and self- sacrifice are not good in then1sel ves aside fron1. the noble ends vvhich follow thetn. T'he good lies only in the excellent results vv hich cotne after. The true nobility of all labor is its end. . \' Polling is an excellent thing if it do son1e. good, but n1any n1en think it is a good thing in itself, though it bring no good result at all. I think this is not nearly enough thought of by those of us who are really polling very hard through our course. And I speak particularly to you, tny friend, who are leading your class with so n1uch success; \ ... ou, \vhose friends are telling you \vhat a wonderful, enduring tnan you are; you, who are thought beyond the advice generally given to students. It is your 1nost dangerous te1nptation. For is this not the reason of the proverb that a valedictorian is never heard ~ of after he leaves college? tie goes out with the feeling that his sacrifice of his natural inclina-

go THE CONCORDIENSIS. --~~----~------------------~------ ... - .. =-----~--~-~~--~====================================== tions~ and his resolute finnness in polling arc things grand and heroic in thcinselYcs. This satisfaction at denying hin1self grows into posi- tive e:njoy111ent of being tnisenlhle, and he be- cotnes a rnorbid useless n1a n. Remen1 Ler that self-sacrifice and self-denial, \Yithout an adequate object are worse than useless. 13ut if polling he so unnatural w·hat is the natural feeling? \'\\'\ ou see it in the child yonder. II ow he hates his le:sson ! Ilovv you hated yours when you \vere at his age! \Vhen you hear a child say he likes polling, you tnay be sure either his health is failing or his n1ind is unnaturally pre- cocious.· 'Vhat he does like though is play. So you too long for play-for pleasure. Mark the distinction, it is not idleness \VC vvish for but plea.sure. Pure idleness is misery. But fron1 pleasure we obtain hopefulness, cheerfulness and health. Pleasure is the real object of all onr polling. It is the only end \Voithy of so great an eflort. For vve n1ust ren1en1bcr that pleasure is only possible to the 111an \\·ho polls earnestly, To enjoy pleasure \Ve tnust have done our poll- ing. For after all it is but a relative ·word. It does not exist except for the hard poller. If you light your latnp in the sunshine it is nothing. It n1ust be surrounded by darkness before you can appreciate its light. A great part of the enjoy- tnent of your pleasure cotnes only fron1 the thought that you have earned it by hard polling. The catnpus in the afternoon or the delightful hour vvith the Century in the evening c~ln be enjoyed only when you are conscious of the task you have well done in the n1orning. There is a vast difference between John 1'askless off for his vacation, hoping for nothing better than son1e new pasti1ne, which 1nay vary the n1onotony of existence a little, and Grinclhead, light-hearted and gay, oft' \Vith the pleasant feeling of having brought son1e difficult polling to an encl. T'hen too severe polling gives flavor to the simplest play, while to the idle m<~n everythiilg is tire- sonle and life seen1s not \Yorth the living, except it be seasoned vvith vice. That certainly does scetn to give it son1e relish. It is curious that sotnc n1en think it fine to seetn idle and useless. There are college n1en wi1o are ashatned to have it knc)\vn that they poll. They like to seen1 more useless and ignorant than they really are. I know a n1an \vho has at bottorn a real desire for distinction. )_T et if one of his friends cornplitnent hin1 on a good recitation, he wHl resent it as though it were a dishonorable charge and '' flunk\ for a week afterward.. Give n1e the n1an who can poll hard and is not ashatned to confess it. He n1ust indeed be weak who can think work any- thing but dignified and honorable l Pleasure then is the end of poUing. It is the pleasure \vhich follow-s our polling that n1akes it worth all the sacrifice it den1ands. For it not only n1akes pleasure possibie, but it elevates the pleasures we enjoy. 1V1iss Lovelace will desc.rihe her last visit to Europe with all the extravagant, hackneyed phrases you have heard so often. How different frotn m.y friend Grindhead's quiet, intense appreciatiou. And the \Vhole distance which separates them is n1easured in hours of hard polling. Yes, \Ve tnust say \vith the poet, \ Labor is the secret of happiness.\ If we could attain good ends without labor we should rejoice. We hate tlhor for its ovvn sake, but through it alone can we reach happiness. Labor tnay be the sytnbol of our pnnishn1ent but it alone n1akes us enjoy pleasure, -recreation aJZd rest. Valedictory of the Class of 1848, in Union College. DELIVERED BY JOEL HU~TINGTO~. [Through the kindness of Rev. Dr. Smith, '48, of \Vest Pittston, Pa , we prinr below the following poem, the title of which will explain itself. The author died in rS54·] Have ye ever stood upon some hillock's crest And watched the sun low sinking to his rest, Down where, in all the gorgeous glow of gold, The clouds lay gathered, ready to enfold The wearied monarch of the day's long race? If e'er ye thus have stood at :-;uch an hour, Have ye not all confessed the entrancing power, An rapt, admiring, gazing from below, Upon the wondrous and immingled glow Of purple, gold and scarlet, wished at heart, The day's bright sovereign never to depart? How lingers then, upon the mountain's side The wistful eye, as slowly upward glide The shades of night, till round its very brow They wrap their shroud, and all is twilight now.

THE CONC·ORDIENSIS. 91 How drops the eye then. from the n1ountain's orest And slowly foi1owing down its wooded breast, Sweeps round the horizon, over stream and plaim, As though they ne'er would meet that .glance again; Comes there not then a sadness o'er your hearts As the calm glory of ~uch summer eve departs, And cmne not all the mem'ries of the day To 1nake more deeply felt that last hour's sway, When dusky, 1--hrowding all the heavens' pure light Sweeps on in sol.emn stillness dark brown night? Thus ever feels the sowl its fond regrets As what is present in the future sets. And ever turn we then to mem'ries voice, And bid her make us in past scenes rejoice One fleeting moment e'er we turn. to tread Th~ unknown fnture, dim before us spread, Whose dark mysterious brow gives; back no glow Save when hope bends her bright inspiring bow. Brothers-a farewell scene is here this hour, And nature bids us yield to mem.'ries power. This day we leave the scenes we loved so well, The green, the garden, and the flowery dell, The winding walks amid yon classic grove Our ling'ring footsteps will no longer rove, Nor longer for us there, the sighing gale Will seem to whisper of sweet Tempe's vale, Whose groves dark spreading in a summer land With deeper foliage wrapped the Grecian band, Till wandering 'mid the magic of the place, One kindled with the heart-entrancing grace And sang in wild, but time-enduring lay, The beauties which around sweet Tempe valley ,p1a.y. But tnemory speaks, \For long amid the grove Ye stay, go part with other scenes ye love.\ We heed the warning-turn we as we go To where yon river rolls its liquid flow, And devious wandering through the wide-spread plain, Cuts out its bed through meads and bending grain. No longer backward on our raptured sight That river shall reflect its silvery light. No longer shall we see the orb of day Sink in yon gorge, gilding his travel'd way, And backward throwing, with reflected light, New forms of beat1ty on the apptoach of night, Tinging each cloud that meets the admirer's eye With the bright glories of th' Italian sky. · No longer will the morning's orient I ight, Reveal yon beauteous gardens to our sight, Where art and nature in a sweet embrace Shed heightened beauty by commingled grace. Farewell each shady walk, each fragrant bed, No 1nore for us your glor-ies will ye spread. Like your own flowers, our day we sported here, Like theirs the passing instant draweth near; But not like them, '\''hen breaks stern winter's chain, Sl1all we, our winte·r o'er, return again. To you who foUow o'er this classic ground, We too must break the cherished links which bound Our hearts in dose communion with your own, Atnid the joys our college days have known. Oh, far may thne prolong the approaching hour, When ye too, meet this farewell's crushin.g power. And you, ye nearer brothers! Who shaH tell The wiJ.dering thoughts which. in our bosoms s·well? With kind fraternal footsteps we may tread No tnore those paths where wisdom's gifts are shed, No more may stand beneath her classic fanes, And side by s,ide, bend, listening to the strains, \Vhich from her opening lips thrill on the heart, An·d all their strength' ning influence impart. Our riven hearts, long knit in friendship tneet, In answering sympathy no more may meet, In kindly converse may no longer share, Of joys partakers, and no less of care. No more may kindle o'er the ancient page \Vhere glow the thoughts of hero, poet, sage. No more together raise the awe struck eye, As science lifts her daring hand on high And puts her finge1· on the heavenly pole Round which the circling orbs in grandeur roll, Mysterious m.oving, to the wondet·ous plan Of Him who threw o'erhead yon mighty span And high uplifting o'er thought's farthest bound, Beneath its arch still bids the world go round, With unseen chains held firmly to that throne Where in majestic power, lie sits alone. We shall no 111ore in yonder house of pt·ayer Mingle with those who will assemble there-- To hear that voice we loved so well to hear, Ascending 1neekly to his Father's ear, Imploring blessings on his pupil's path, And heavenly rescue from heaven's righteous wrath. Return, Oh God! the blessings on his head, Be thine the hand by which his steps are lead! And be his counsels on our hearts engraved, Till earth shall fade, and all in heaven are saved. Oh teach us to regard that warning voice, Which ever urged the right upon our choice, Which ever warned from error's flickering beam, Misleading like the marsh-light meteor gleam, Which glows an instant brightly round a name, Then fades, and leaves it to eternal shame. Which. lifts aloft her giddy follower's head, Then downward thrusts him with the u11known dead. So flies an arrow in the ether high, And makes no step within the azure sky, How far soe'er it wings its upward way, Its height attained, it makes no moment's stay,

92 T·HE CONCORDIENSIS.

One instant pause, Io! in the air serene To fancy's eye, two glitte11ing forms are seen, Bright ·with the radiance of the. heavens' purest glow, · In love they're gazing on this band behYw, And stealing soft, with richest Ir1Us.ic's spell, Their voices mingling, breathe, with ours,-farewell.

We had been friends fton1 childhood-- Allen Kent and I-- bad been roo1n 1nates at college, and 1netn hers of the san1e fraternity, and now that we had graduated we were finner friends than ever. He was a n1agnificent fellow; tall, n1uscular and handsot11e, but beneath his strong, sinew- bound breast he had a heart as tender as a wo- rnan's. Strong,. brave aln1ost to recklessness, yet gentle and kind. I re1ne1nber one nigl1t while we were in coBege. In the early part of the evening he, together with two others, held the college gates in the face of a 1no b of angry townstnen with whmn the students were at war for so1ne cause or other, and later on he was hunting around for a ladder to get a poor, for- lorn kitten out of a tree up which a dog had chased her. Although a great favorite with the ladies h.e had never n1a.rriecl. Once he had loved a girl fondly, and to her he had opened his heart, only to have it seared and scarred by the living coals of coquetry. I had hoped that the wound would soon heal, but as years went by without any signs of his recovery I had pronounced hirn a confirn1ed bachelor. He did not live a clois- tered existence by any n1eans however, for he went n1uch in society and had hosts of fetninine friends, and to each of thern he was the san1e finn, kind friend-no n1ore. . I had been absent for a 1nonth. To tell the truth I had been on n1yvveddingtri.p, for, unlike Allen, I had succun1bed to the fascinations ot the dearest, the best-but then I don't suppose • you will be so rnuch interested in 1ny wife as I a1n -and I would not like it at all if you were-so I will on1it the rest. But naturally I had been so all absorbed that I had scarcely thought of Allen during n1y absenee, so the first thing I did when I returned was to go down to his office to in- vite hirn up to tea and to spend the evening. ''No ; Allen hasn't been down this afternoon,\ his partner replied to 1ny inquiry, ''I don't know where he is, he will be down before we close though; won't you wait?\ \No I ansvvered, \ I will leave hin1 a note.\ I sat down at Allen's desk, and as I rolled the top up I caught sight of a photograph fra1ne •

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 93 standing inside. It was of plush and had a little door which concealed the picture. With the audacity of long acquaintance I opened the door. The picture was so beautiful that it n1ade n1e start. It was, a girl with deep black hair, big black eyes, with long lashes-· pshaw, I can't de- scribe her or do her justice, so I wiH only say that it represented the prettiest little black eyed girl that I ever saw-I say the prettiest black eyei girl, for 1ny ·vvife is blonde. ~'Who in the 1nischief is this, Jack?\ I asked his partner. \That? \'Vhy, that's Miss Maylen-Minnie M I ., a y en. ,, 'Yes; but who's she·?\ I asked, for his an- swer explained nothing to n1<e. Jack turned around and looked at 1ne as if I had asked hin1 who George Washington was. ., 'Minnie May len.? Don't know -vvho she is? Why that's the girl that Allen protected on the street, got stabbed for, and who nursed hin1 back to life.\ Then it vvas n1y turn to be surprised. Allen was very n1odest, and seldon1 wrote a bout hin1- self, but then I thought he would have written al)ottt this. So I n1ade Jack give n1e full partic- ulars. It was rornantic enough for the n1iddle ages. AUen, it seetns, was .going horne one night wh.en he carne upon a young lady in deep 1nourning, heavily veiled and alone. She vvas doing her best to avoid a gang of loafers who were pursuing her in the n1ost insulting tnan- ner. Allen, of course, took her part, and in the 1nelee which followed received a knife thrust in the shoulder, although he succeeded in driving off her assailants. Sorely wounded as he was he would not perrnit her to go hon1e alone, and escorted her to her door, only to fall across it in a dead faint. Then it was the old, old story. When he awoke it was to look into her sweet face, to feel he1· cool hand upon his forehead, to hear the rnusic of her voice. He awoke to find hitnself in love, and in love with a -vvon1an who was in every way worthy of hitn. Upon ex~unination it V\Tas found that the only valuable things left by her father, who had l:e- cently died, were his daughter and her rnother, a sweet faced, white haired gentlewotnan. So it was decided that they should be rnarried in:l- tnecliately. You can itnagine how elated I was over 1ny friend's good fortune. Although Allen was on·e of the best fellows in the world, as I have said before, still no n1an can hope to be con1plete as a bachelor. My own honeyn1oon had not be- gun to wane, hut still was full, glowing and splendi<l, so I \vas in. the best position in the world to congratulate hin1 upon his happiness. * * * vVhy is it that Heaven SOlnetin1eS seen1S so unkind ; nay, aln1ost unjust? Why is it that the sweetest cups are dashed fron1 our hands just as \Ve are a bout to taste their cherished con- tents? Ah, -vve kno\v not. Fro1n the Vast, the Supren1e, con1es the unwelcorne order, and n1an, poor groper in this world dark with sin and ten1ptation, 1nust bow his head in subn1 is- s ion to Eternal Wisdon1. Minnie was dangerously ill, lying in fact at the point of death. Night after night Allen had watched over her bedside, tireless. faithful, vigi- lant, until his face was haggard, and he seen1ed like an old 1nan. As I passe:!cl his door one nig-ht I was seized with an irresistible in1pulse to go in. There was no one in his roo1n, and it was dark. I lighted the gas and sat down and waited. I could not tell why. I see1ned to act under the direction of a superior, exterior force. I seen1ed to know that he would soon be in, but I could assign no reason for this feeling. Suddenly h1s dog arose frotn the heaTth rug, whined, shivered, and presently sat up and how led. A horrid, clatnrny feeling took possession of tne. The n1oist, cbill air of the grave see1ned to blow up- on n1y n1ce, chilling n\le to the tnarrow; I seen1ed to detect the da 111 p, noison1e odor of fresh sodden leaves and decaying ~Tood-and still the dog howled. Chill after chill passed over n1.e ; I tried to speak; tny tongue seetned to be frozen. At last there vvas a step outside. I felt tnyself once tnore. I seen1ed to awake frotn a night- Blare. Of course it was Allen coining. He entered. Yes ; it vvas ADen, but how changed ! With bent fratne and halting step, eyes deep

94 TilE CONCORD'lENSIS. -- ---------------------------- ---- ------- SN n.:ken, and vvith a glassy, ghastly stare, his asiten face showing so plainly against his beard, :he looked to be twenty years older than when I sa'v hitn last. He did not speak, but I under- s:to()<Jl. I grasped his hand in tnute syrnpathy, b~tt we could not say anything. He dropped into a chair and buried his head in his hands. T:h,e dog can1e and licked his face, hut be did not 1nove. Minute after tuinute passed, and yet he dic1not stir. Three ti1nes the clock sounded the half hour, and stiH he kept his positio!l. Seeing that I could be of no use I thought to steal away and leave hi1n, but he divined tny tl-1{}Ng·hts and said in a voice pathetic in its en- treaty, \Don't go; stay here.\ So l stayed -vvith hin1; hour after hour went by. r could stand it no longer, so I threw Illy- self on the lounge, intending to sleep ; he could wake tn.e if he desired anything. Still I could not sleep. I see1ned under a spell I could not kee_p n1y eyes oft~ fron1 Allen, try as I n1ight. Suddenly he lifted his face, and looking up- wards, Ufted his thin arn1s in tnute, heart-rend- in.g appeal. Not a 1nuscle Inoved, not a tear dn~Jpped fron1 his eyes. He seen1ed a statute rathe1· than a 1nan. I began to be alanned. I feared that his brain rnight give way ; I tried to tnove, to speak, but could not; I was bound poweTless. S·uddenly I heard a Bound ; it was the sound of t:l\Je ecl1o of a ponderous organ, swelling, dy- ing, rising, falling, and tningled with it were the sou1Kls of chin1es of hells of precious 1netal, and the pure, s .. weet notes of a superhun1an chorus. It filled the rootu, which no-vv see1ned to x:ise, to expand, so that its boundaries were itnnJ..easurable. Up and down this boundless space surged the angelic strains. It vvas not a reel uiu1n-it was a song of love triun1phant. It had been dark before; now caine huninous clouds of pink, of tender blue, the soft wann clouds of twilight. They hovered for an instant oveT Allen, then descending cove-red hitn as with a. vail. When they lifted, up soared the song .as to the very heavens, joys pure and love- ly it t-old-the joys of eternal Heaven. AH·en now stood erect-again his old self; and \Vho was that \Vith hitn? his love ?-but in spirit, divested of the coarseness of the flesh. Tangible 'she was, but pure; her face was the Saine, yet changed; her eyes were bl·ue, the soft blue of the rippling waters, and in thetn was love-· ·-love supretne, and love exultant in vic- tory. Her hair was white, V\rhite as the eddying snow flakes, and her skin transparent, and of the pale, wann, delicious pink of the blush rose. Clothed she was, but in the fleecy softness of a su1nm.er's cloud. For a tnornent they stood thus,. the tnortal and the ini.Inortal, looking at each other in love's unspoken language. Then the clouds again enveloped thetn. Again they lifted, as they did the living 1nusic which had died to a whispering n1unnur again swelled forth. For lo ! both were iintnortal. Allen vvas idealized, :~najestic he looked, as he stood there, his snow white cro-vvn of hair and his i1nn1aculate beard falling over that grand chest of vvhich Jove hitnself n1ight well be proud. Thus they stood for a n1on1ent, and then the clouds again de- scended, and then arose, and -vvith thetn the itntnortals. Lovver, lovver sounded the chorus, and at last it died out in the distance. I hid n1y face and -vvept, wept that I could not join thern in their eternal happiness. * * * * * The straight, sharp beatns of the noonday sun beat upon 1uy face when I awoke. I started, aln1ost shrieked aloud at n1y release, at tny re- turn to the world of Inortals. Allen sat where I had left hin1, only that his face was turned upwards, and upon it rested a s1nile of perfect peace. It was his body only; his soul had n1yself seen, soaring with it& spirit bride; up, up, in vast, eternal love. GEo. CoMsTocK BAKER. \Life with the old has but few resources of pleasure. It all crystalizes into n1e1nory. The present is a kind of platfonu upon which they wait for the last train, and they spend this wait- ing in tnountiug the chariot and riding back over Life's highway, reviewing and recounting its events, 11111sing over the past, and co1u tnuning with the spectres and phantotns that 111e1nory invokes, and weeping over the sod wh.ere the blossotns fell early frotn the ste1n.\

WE TRUST that the larger space than usual given to itnportant college tnatters in this issue will rneet with the approval of our readers. * * * WE ARE glad to note that the question of the conferring of degrees has at last been settled, so far, at least, as Union College is concerned. The staternent relative to this question in President Webster's speech at the Chicago banquet wa~ clear, straightforward ancl to the point. In the future only those students 'vho have pursued successfully the classical course shall be eligible to the degree of A. B., while the higher de- grees, such as A. M., M·. S., and Ph. D., vvill only be given to those who have co1npleted courses of study and passed through excunina- tions leading up to those degrees. .... The protniscuous scattering around of un- earned honors, a custo1n which has been so largely indulged in by 1nany of our colleges, has I~efl:ected not a little upon the character of Atner- ican scholarship. Degrees which in Europe signify vast intellectual attaintn,ents and years of patient study-degrees which are, or ought to be, peculiarly the scholar's, have an1oag us be- cotne the con1n1on property of the ordinary teacher, successful politician and philanthropic n1illionaire. Union college has, respecting this question, ado±)ted a course creditable to herself, .and one which we are sure \'ill m.eet with the approval of all lovers of true learning. * * * THE hope expressed in the last issue of THE CoNCORDIENSIS that the Chicago banquet n1ight result in .rnaterial aid to the college is in a fair way to becotning realized. - President Webster reports hitnself very 1nuch pleased with the hearty reception accorded hirn, and highly grat- ified '\vith the enthusiasn1 in old Union's cause, which he everywhere tnet with. The source of the greatest encourage1nent however, is the business-like action taken by the association with reference to the financial condition of the college. l(novving the strong character and great i nflueuce of tnany of the tnetnbers of the Northwestern Association, '\Ve feel strengthened in our belief, that aid in the near future tnay be safely counted on frotn Union's sons in the West. * * * A COMMITTEE has been appointed, consisting of representatives frotn the different classes, to raise n1oney for the support of the \ Nine.\ The college acted wisely in adopting this course instead of holding a fair or tninstrel show, as was at first proposed. The students have altnost to a 111211 voted to support the \ Nine\ the con1- ing season by their own contributions. Let it then be supported-they have voluntarily as- stuned this task, vvhich can only be successfully accornplished by generous subscriptions on their part, promptly paid. ·ll<- * * IT GIVES us great pleasure to n1ake an an- nouncernent which we are confident the students will hail with delight.

Annual Banquet at the Hotel Richelieu, Chicago. In response to the very urgent invitation of the co1nn1ittee of the Alumni Association of the Northwest., there assetnbled in the banquet hall of the Hotel Richelieu on the evening of Thurs- day Feb. z8th, a large asc;etnbly of tnen frorn everv rank of life. Men who had shed lustre on .J the fair fatne of their Aln1a Mater, and vvho had con1e together, far away frotn the classic gray walls of their college hon1e, to revive once tnore the good old days of yore, and to join with their brethren in the East in greeting with delight the new chief under whose leadership the de- clining fortunes of \ Old Union \ are fast re- VIVIng. The enthusiasn1 of the evening was unbounded. Aged men, who, with the benediction of Alina Mater fresh in their n1inds, had gone forth to spend the best part of their lives in advancing the interests of the great N orthvvest, joined with the younger graduates in the wan11th of their expression of love for their dear \Old Union,\ while on e\reryf.:'1ce could be seen confidence in the new president, Dr. Webster, and hope rather faith in a glorious future for the coHege.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9.7 --- ~---~ ------ -- ---- ------~--- -- - ---- -- - The follovving letter was received frotn the Rev. Dr. Edvyin )V. Rice: It would give n1e great pleasure to attend the annual n1~eeting of the Union College Alun1ni Association in :C:hicago on the 28th inst. I would be delighted to look in the faces of those vvho have done so nn1ch to n1ake the great Northwest what it is, and particularly to share in ,the reJoicing which. you rnust have over the irnproved condition and prospects of our Alina Mater, but other duties press upon and detain tne here. Thoughso fara-vvav inbodv,I shall be ~ J ~ m.entally present \vith you and thus share in your congratulations that the ~College now has a per- mane'lzt President, energetic, conscientious and broad-1ninded enough to set aside petty dissen- sions, and to shape the College curricuhnn and policy that it will again send forth fron1 its halls so1ne of the foretnost n1en in every profession and walk of life, who vvill be stahvart statestnen, lawyers, legislators, clergytnen. physicians, editors, and n1en of science, capable ofrnoulding opinion in this £oren1ost country in the educa- tional world. Said the Hon. Ju~lson S. Landon: I regret that I can be present only in spirit at your n1eeting in honor of Old Union. But I can congratulate you, as I n1ost heartily do, upon the new life ancl confidence vvith tnany attendant benefits, which the accession of Dr. Webster to the presidency and his right cotnprehension and adn1inistration of affairs have brought to pass and prornise to continue at1d increase. You n1ay teel sure that both in deserving and doing well the College is in the right way. The Hon. David Murray wrote as follows: I regret very n1uch that I will not be able to visit Chicago, and attend the annual1neeting and dinner oi the Union College Alun1ni Association of the Northwest. It is now plain that every- thing is going on well and nobly in the College. President Webster has been in the office this 1norning, and he seen1s in good spirits in regard to the prospects of the College. Sytnpathizing with your earnest desire to pro- Inote the good of the College, and regretting ex- ceedingiy that I a1n not able to be with you at your dinner, I an1, Sincerely yours, DAVID MuRRAY. The following also read fro1n Rev. Dr. Geo. Alexander: I an1 sorry that I cannot respond in person to the \ cordiat \ and '' urgent\ and ~' particular'' invitation of the Union College Altnnni Associa- tion of the Northwest. I cordially thank you for the honor and particularly desire to be there. I presun1e that the urgency of the invitation indicates the purpose of the Altunni of the Northwest to drown the voices of the Altnnni of the East with their acclatnations and pr01nises of support to the Old College and the New Presi- dent. Ex-Governor Blair of Michigan vvrote: I find that it will not be possible for n1e to be at Chicago on to-tnotTow evening as I expected to attend the banquet of the Union College Alun1ni of the N ortlnvest. I have been particularly anxious to attend that n1eeting because I have had but very fe\v oppor- tunities to 1neet any of the ahunni of Union College during the fifty years that have passed since I graduated in the class of I 839· I can only say that I have never lost n1y interest in the College and have ahyays hoped for its continued prosperity. It will give n1e pleasure to join in any n1cas- ures that the Ahunni 1nay adopt to pro1note the future growth of the institution and to secure its well-earned fan1e of the oast. .L I thank you for the kindness of the special invitation sent n1e to be present at the 1neeti ng and banquet and deeply regret that circun1stances beyond tny control have prevented n1e fi·o1n at- tending. I trust the 1neeting will be highly enjoyable and profitable and I retnain Very respectfully, Your obedient servant, AusTIN BLAIR. Letters of regret were also received fro1n Hiran1 D.

But I know about Union College, and as a practical tnan., talking to practicaln1en, ~Hn. s.ure that I can tnake the position and the needs of the college plain to you. During the last 2D or 30 years tnany things have cotnhi:1ed to dect:e.a<Se the ntunbers of students at Union., and dhniaish its influence. Atnong these 1nay be n1entioned the loss of Southern students due to the var; the loss of Western students due in part to the grovvth of n1any excellent educational institution .. s in the west; 'but above and beyond all we n\lay say that internal dissensions, in fact civil w.ar, has injured the College. For tnany years tliere have been contending factions in the College. I tnyself have been engaged in the these cUssen- sions, actively engaged. I can not say th crt I an1 sorry for the part that I took. I acted n.c- cording to the light that I had, and how can a1>1y tnan do othetwise. On the other hand I ha.ve no fault to find with those whon1 I felt bound :to oppose. But '' leaving the things that are behind~\ I can say to you to-night, that all factions, all dis- sensions, have disappeared. vVe have a uni,ted board of T'rustees, a united Faculty, in the Bast certainly a united and enthusiastic body ()f Alutnni. That the satne condition will pre-vail in the Northwest is evident by this rneeting and by the nutnerous loyal letters received fron1. th0~e whc can not be with us. We have touc]ijed bottotn. Undoubtedly we found the botto1n so1newhat low down; but we are now steadily ns1ng again. Our Freshtnan class is t11uc:h larger than we had any reason to expect. _All the indications point to a large increase for tbc next collegiate year. I confess I mn 1nuch con- cerned about the position and action of the Alurrtni of the N ortbwest.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 99 pends largely :the solution of the questio,n, shall u.nion becotne a local College. I need not say that I £1111 above all things anxious to avoid such a result. As 'lny appeal is to you it is right that you should be infonned as to what we propose to do, and vvhat we need. ·union is stricti y a non-sectarian ·College, yet it is a Christian Col- lege. We intend to conduct the instruction in such a n1anner that the latest discoveries and the theories of sound ·science shall be brought into reiation with the religion of Christ. No n1an ought to send his son to Union who is unwiUing to have the fundanleBtal truths of Christianity assun1.ecl in all the teaching set forth in the chapel and in the lecture roo1n ; and no tnan ought to send his son to Union who is afraid of scientific n1ethods or of scientific results. Both will n1:ost assuredly be taught. . Our elective studies no\v begin with the last tenn Junior. There is little reason to believe that they will be extended. A nevv arrange- B.l'ent of those studies will he n1nde presently~ so that students can select courses of studies, and they will be required to do so. There is less reason inour college than in tnany other colleges for an extensive elective course, because we already have four distinct courses frmn \V hich students entering the college can choose. In re- gard to degrees conferred, the A. B. will be litnited to students graduating in the classical course. The degrees for the other courses are stil 1 under consideration. T'he degrees of A. M. M. S. and Ph. D., will no longer be conferred in course or as honorary degrees, but will be earned. We hope to publish before Con11nence- n1ent a staten1ent of the work and exatnination requisite to the obtaining of the degrees. Our financial condition is not satisfactory. We have a large property, frotn which \Ve tnay reasonably hope to recei\Te an incon1e adequate to the needs ..of the College in a fe\v years. But at present this is not the case. I want n1oney i 111 n1edia.tel y, n1ore than the College can furnish 1r.e. For this reason, with the approval of the Trustees, I an1 obtaining subscriptions to be paid annually for the next fiye years. I have not consulted the officers of this association, as to the propriety of introducing this subject at this titne. I tnust have tnoney fron1 sotne soutce, :1nd I always prefer to assun1e tny own responsibilities. The College needs n1oney, an1nng other things to increase the tuunber of instructors, tn giYe better pay to sun1e teachers who are at present underpaid, and to in1prove the dorn1itories. The President concluded by thanlung the Association for the kind and hearty \vay in \vhich he had been received, and in reply to a question, said that he \vonld cotne to Chicago \vhcnever the .. l\ssoc1ation saw fit to hold a 1nceting and invite hin1. ... \t the business tneeting of the 1\ssociation the old officers vvere re-elected.

The Chicago Tribune of 1\farch I, speaking of ~he banquet says : The gathering last night recalls the history of one of the oldest and n1ost \videly useful colleges of the United States. It was founded in I795 (located at Schenectady, N. r...-.) nearly a cen- tury ago, graduating its first class in I 797. That n1ost distinguished of An1erican instructors and , pulpit orators, Dr. Eliphalet Nott, . becan1e its . President in rSo-t-, and remained at the head of. the college until his death in I866-a period of . sixty-t\vo years. Under no other college Presi- dent, perhaps, have so n1any distinguished tnen graduated, in this or any other country, as were graduated under Dr. Nott during this period. In all of the learned professions, in the service of the State and in private life, the altunni of this college have everywhere taken first rank. The tnention of the natnes of a few of the n1any whose fan1e and reputation have been historic will :;uffice. As distinguished ~t the bar, on the bench, and in political life, John C.

The vVar of the Rebellion and the death of · Dr. Nott, soon after its close, seriously affected the prosperity of this tirne honored college. The election of Dr. vVebster to the Presidency of the college in the sun1n1er of r 888 has gi~en a tresh i1npetus to the 1noven1ent so long wished :for by the alun1ni and the public, to restore it to its olcl pl<lce a111ong Atnerican colleges. The alrunni of the East have rallied to the support of President Webster with enthusiasrn. 'I'he gathering of the ahunni of the Northwest on the occasion of their annual banquet ~1t the Richelieu last night shovvs that the ne\v President is rapidly taking his place in the hearts of the ahnnni of the idolized \old n1an eloquent,\ Dr. Nott.

An Ohio ·newspaper tells this sto1-y about Horace Porter, son of the General : When he was in Princeton college (he graduated in the class of '87) he \vas ill for so1ne days. While he was stretched out on a couch in his roon1 there catne a tap at the door. \ Who's there?\ he shouted. HIt's n1e~ Dr. McCosh,'' :was the answer in a hard Scotch brogue. \ \.,. ou're a liar,\ replied Porter, who really thought it was a classtnate. \If was Dr. McCosh he would say, 'It is I.'\ There \vas no answer to this but the shuffling of feet do\vn the corridor. Young Porter ran to the door, cautiously opened it, looked down the hall, and saw the back and tall, stooped fonn of Dr. McCosh disappearing. 1\he president of Princeton never spoke of the inci- dent ; nor did Porter until he had his sheepskin. The above iten1 is going the rounds as original. That story was first told -vvay back in the forties, and at the expense of Dr. Nott, president of Union college, and inste£ld of being a son of 1 Gen. Porter, it was a Trojan nan1ed Merrin1an. The story has been, is and always will be a stand by at old '' Union.\ Personals. '65. Hon.- vV tn.

ENGINE-ERING DEPARTMENT. The Sewer System of Gre·enbush, N Y. \V ork ·On the se\ver systetn of G·reenbush was begun in the spring of last yecu and was all finished early in Septen1ber. Landreth and Fitzgerald, of this city, were tbC' engineers who had charge of the work. The syste1n, not including the sewer of East Albany, which is reallv connected \vith the Greenbush sewer, consists of about ten n1iles. 1'he sewerage all flows through !]·>ipes, no brick work being used to conyey it. Of course in a. large city where there is a gr~e~tt atnount of se-vverage tnatter to be disposed ofand the sewers are 111anv n1iles in extent~ these brick conduits have to be used, but in a stnall t<Jwn they are not necessary. The largest pipes that vvere used were twenty-four inches in d ia1neter and the smallest eight or ten inches. The sewerage is cn1ptiecl into the Hudson River through two · outlets. The con1n1on sewer pipe was used principally. Each pipe was tested just before it was laid, to see if it vvere sound and without cracks. Great care was taken in. laying the sewer, to have the pipes lai<l in a straight line vvithout any crooks or bends a:S tl1ese neces- sarily n1ake the joints fit in1pe1fectly. Every joint was first stufl<:xl with p::tc1<ing rope and then ce1nent was put all around it., thus n1aking the joint as tight as possible. When the pipe \vas to be exposed to the air a twei!ve or fourteen inch iron pipe was W:led, and the joints leaded instead of ce1nented. These iron p~pes were also used where the course of the sewer ran ~1nder the railroad tracks as it was thought, that t 1

THE CONCORDIENSIS. I05 if there was to be any jar fron1 the trains pass- ing above, the iron would stand it better than the ordinary pipes. 1,he sewer was laid through the centre of each street, except vvhereother pipes.,previously laid, as gas or water pi pes, prevented it. Man holes V~rere placed at every cross street and where these cross streets were far apart 1nan holes were put in every three hundred feet between. Flush tanks were put in at suitable places generany, wherever there was a sharp change ofgrade. The VanVranken Hush tanks -vvere the ones used. They work auton1atically, flush- ing out the sewers tvvo or three tin1es a day without obliging any one to look after the1n. A Y shaped pipe or a\ Y '' as it is con1tnonly called, was placed opposite every house and at every twenty-five feet where vacant lots occurred, so that connections with the rnain sewer, frotn the houses, buildings and so forth, could be n1ade at any ti1ne. The suTface \Vater was drained into catch basins which were placed in the gutter at street corners and fro1n these basins pipes led into the tnan-holes anc1 hence into the tnain sewer. T'he depth, fron.1 the surface of the ground, at which the pipes vvere laid, of course varied on account of the gnl.de, the greatest depth being nineteen feet. This was on a sicle hill where it was not practicable to change the grade so as to bring the pipes nearer to the sur- face. However the pipes were all at a depth exceeding that to which frost penetrates. Thit, sewer seetns adequate to the den1ands of a town the size of Greenbush and if well put in, as it undoubtedly is, can cause but little trouble. Mining Engineering. In n1ining engineering the instrun1ents used are the transit, latnps, tapes and reading glass. The transit is the enginee1~s transit with a vertical circle attached for reading vertical angles and there is also a level tube attached to the telescope. The lan1.ps used are oillan1ps which have leveling screws so that they can be leveled in order that the top of the wick rnay swing in the sarne horizontal plane. Steel tapes are always used for the reason that if the cloth tape is used it is tnuch tnore liable to shrink or stretch on account of the tnoisture in the tnines. The reading glass is perhaps as essential as any of the above instrun1ents, for the light frotn your oillatnp is so poor that jt is in1.possible to read the angles without the aid of the glass. The tripods have extension legs as it would be itn- possible to use those with rigid legs as often- titnes you have to \ set up\ the instrtunent very low in order to see even a short distance, and the surf~lce of the floor is so uneven that you seldon1 find a level place to '~set up.\ Surveys in 1nines are always n1ade with refer- ence to the true rn ericlian and on the 'work \vhere I was placed vve did all our instna11ent work hy traversing. For convenience it \vill he best to expiain a fe\V tenns \vhich will be used in the subsequent description. The shaft of the n1ine is the place frotn \vhich the ore is hoisted and by which access to the n1 ine is gained. The drift is a narrow passage through rock or \vaste n1aterial to get to the valuable ore and is fro111 8 to I 5 feet wide. The stope is the excavation frorn which the ore is taken. There were so1ne stations located in the tnain shaft so that no surface work \vas necessary as would have been the case .had there been no previous surveys of the n1ine. The stopes are all referred to son1e leyel such as the Ioo, zoo or 500 feet level which signifies their vertical depth below the surface. The best tin1e for 1naking a survey of the 1nines, is at night after the tnen have all stop})ed work, as, at that ti tne, there is no blasting which would be liable to jar the instnunent out of level and n1oreover you escape the unpleasant- ness of the smoke which results frotn blasting. In our survey vve started fron1 a station locatecl at the zoo feet level and ran do\vn the n1ain shaft to the botton1 of the 111ine, locating pen1.1anent stations. These stations are generally located in the roof as they are less liable to be disturbed. In this surveying for rapidity and convenience, three tripods are used, as the transit tnan can set up over the starting point, while your assistant is setting up one of the lmnps over the station to -vvhich you backsight and another can be taking the other and setting up at a convenient place for a ne\v station. After the backsight is taken, the upper n1otion being clan1ped, the lo:vver tnotion is clan1pecl and the telescope is then Te- versecl and the upper n1otion is then loosened and the foresight is taken ; after the vertical hair bisects the flan1e of the iarnp, the telescope is clan1ped and the xniddle horizontal hair is brought to cover the edge of the vvick by n1eans of the tangent scre\v attached to the telescope. Then both the horizontal and vertical angles are read, the latter having a negative sign going down hill and a positive sign up hill. The· lower tnotion is then unclan1ped and the transit tnan unscrews the transit, leaving the tripod over the station and passes forvv:trd to the next station and sets up his instnuncnt on the tripod at that station, while the assistant brings up the fonner backsight and sets up the latnp on the tripod

106 THE CONCORDIENSIS;. over that station atH~ then takes the other tripod and passes forward taking the other larnp and setting up a ne\v forward station, and thus the work c:1n be carried on quite rapidly and you ahvays have a backsight to check on before tnoving forward. It is better to take no 1neasuren.1ent between stations until all angles, \Vhich are to be read frotn the station, are taken, ns you n1ay hit the instrun1ent and thro\v your \vork all out. Meas- uren1ents are taken fron1 the h·orizontal axis of the telescope to the top of the wick of the lan1p. vT ertical distances are carried frotn one station to another by carefully n1easuring the distance frorn the floor or roof to the axis of the telescope or to the top of the vvick of the la1np and in tlutt n1anner, all the heights of the stations in the n1ine are referred to a 1nonun1ent, on the surface of which the height above sea level is known. Distances between sta.tions are read to hundredths of a foot \vhile those in the stope to the nearest tenths. In 1naking surveys of the stopes, ten1porary stations are located in the drift and the horizontal and vertical angles are n1easured as before, dis- tances between stations are taken and the dis- tances of the station fron1 the sides of the drift and also those frotn the floor and roof so that the width, height and length of the drift are deter- n1inecl. When the place where the stope co1n- n1ences is reached, a station is located in the stope fron1. which all the principal changes in the contour of the sides can be seen. The instru- tnent is set up at this station and your assistant takes one end of the tape ancl his latnp and gives you the principal points of the stope, estin1ating the distances to the roof and floor. Pillars are located by taking a point at one corner and esti- Inating the breadth and length. The tnost tireson1e and uninteresting part of the work is the reduction of the surveys. The reductions are usually nwde in a note book, so that at any ti1ne you can refer to it and get the ordinates of any station of a fonner survey. T'he first thing to be n1acle is the reduction for horizon- tal and vertical distances. Then the horizontal distances are taken, and fro111 then1 and the bear- ing, the latitudes and departures are found. These reductions are all rnade by sines and cosines of the angles and the fonn of note book for vertical reductjons would be Station I Vert. An g. I H yp. I Cos. I Sine I Base I Height And the con1putaUons would be tnade on the opposite page, for latitude ancl departures the fonner would be Station I Bearing I Hor. Dist. I Cos. I Sine I Lat. I Dep. . After the latitude and departure are found, they are referred to a single station or reference n1onun1ent. The plotting then cotn·mences, the paper is usnaHy divided into too foot squat·es and the rnon1 Hnent is located on one of these 'd' 111 en . uut.s.
