A As First President Faculty Is Thanked For Help in Making Start On January 1, 1945, a new honor- ary organization received official acknowledgement, and joined the family of Student Activities. The organization, which is tem- porarily nameless, consists of stu- dents who have been at Union for more than two terms. There are eleven members; Robert Potter, President, David Cohen, Marvin Schondorf, William Baker, Gordon Newell, Calvin Simmons, Robert Tan, Richard Bullock, Richard Tobin, Phillip Sottile, and Frank Greenwood. The purposes of the organization are: To perform services for Union College and to maintain its old tra- ditions and college spirit. To date the organization has accomplished the following: ushered at all home basketball games, met the visiting teams at the station, formulated plans for helping Prof. Ketz with the Freshman Orientation Program, and has ushered at all Chapel serv- ices.

The collection of records from which these programs are drawn is the Standard RCA Broadcast Album, comprising approximatel,- 800 classical recordings, and an ad- ditional 300 popular pressings. Both groups are supplemented by month- ly shipments of the latest pressings. These two gz·oups of records, added to the collection which the Society possessed, make the record library of your campus r·adio station one of the most extensive in the Capi- tol District. The constitution states \there shall be no religious or racial de- serimination in this organization.\ B!'ginning The organization had an unusual beginning. One day last November Dr. Fox called Wiiliam Baker, the last undergraduate member of the old Garnet Key Society, to his office and spoke of the necessity of ac- tivating the society. At the same time a parallel idea sprang out of an early morning bull session. Baker and the bull session even- tually met, resulting in the forma- tion of this new honorary society. In a few weeks the organization expects to have a title and some identifying insignia. Huge white icebergs will be lin- ing the walls, with snow men, polar bears and penguins galore adorning .them. The icebergs will be back- grounded by a lighter blue pano- tama.

AGAIN-SKATING RINK? \\'hat has become or the skating rink pro- posal·~ h1 tlw :\'oY. 17, 19-1 t issue of the Concordiensis, the possibilit~· of a skating- rink being erected on thr-> south end of Grad- uate Council field was sug-gested. To date no apparent action has been taken on this sug-- gestion. lt was hoped that the constrw:tion or use of the rink might be in progress by !10\\'. \\' e thought then and think nO\\' that a rink is a timely suggestion and \\'ould appre- ciate .some ans\\'er from the Student Council concerning this plan. Perhaps the ::--;Ac could proffer its assistance in this matter. for the major portion of the use1·s of the proposed rink would be trainees. The1·e is practically conclusive proof that no one is in disfavor with the idea. Certainl~­ there can be no reason fo1· objections, except where labor and finance nre concerned. These two are the only ol>stades in the \Yay as the field itself is not in use and will not be until next :::lpring. Our .. Inquiring Re- porter\ has raised the issue for the benefit of the readers of this week's Concordy. The eager affirming responses of not only the selected few in that column but of man~· othe1·s seem to leaw little room fo1· doubt that the plan is backed by the student bod~-. The ::-:.tudent Council may be waiting· fur someone o1· some group to make the first effort towards promoting this project or perhaps they have already investig-ated the pmctica.uilities of the suggestion. A.t any rate, whichever route the members of the Student Council { o1· K .-\C) have taken at present in their individual reactions to the idea, some approvals or disappmvals would prove ~:ratifying to the proposers and the many students who are in favor of having: a rink. The actual cost and the labor involved in the construction of such an ice-skating rink eould be negligible. If we are to take seri- ously the man;\· offers of help from the stu- dents themselves, the labor problem has al- ready been solved. All that is needed is the financial backing· for this enterprise and that cannot amount to Yery much. l\nion had a baseball team last Spring through the co- operation of the student body; can we not co- operate again and in a ve1·y short time have the ice rink all of us approve? l\ntil warmer weather puts in an appear- ance, a rink \vould be the ideal spot to spend a \vinter evening. Consider it as the choice location for an inexpensive Saturda~· evening date! It's more healthy to be out in the fresh air than cooped up in some smokey gin- mill. The only asailable ponds where skating is now possible are at inconvenient distances from campus and are troublesome to reach. How about it, Student Council and XAC, are we to heal' more about the erection of nn ice-skating rink in the \'ery near future? CUT CONTROVERSY Will someone tell me what's the score'?\ Don't quote us as to how many times \Ve've heard this phrase this past \veek. What kind of a cut system has Union? That seems to be the leading question in the minds of many civilian students who received frantic calls from distraught pa1·ents during the last two weeks in an attempt to disco\'ei· the cause of the Dean's present consternation. Several men hnve uncovered their \\'oes to find that they ha\'e the sum of .)-10 cuts when the~· m::re not expecting any upmar until they had reached their supposed quota of the number of hours of courses taken. At the beginning of the accelerated pro- gram in July of 19.J3, it \\'as the understand- ing of civilian students, who had been in- formed uy their respective proctors, that one \\'CJU]d be allo\\·ed the number of cuts per credit hours. Today the system seem entire- ly re\'el'sed and regulations from the Dean's office come issuing forth to an uninformed student body. We are told that we must not oppose colleg·e rules, but may we be bold enoug·h to ask where there rules orig-inate? Stemingly new rules are formulated as every ne\\' and individual situation al'ises.

In the last sec- onds of play the Panthers were leading only 42-41, but Bill Holstein fouled Weiss of the victors as the gun sounded and the latter made good the two charity shots for the three-point margin of victory. Again the Garnet's inaccuracy . from the foul line was instrumental in their defeat, as they canned but \ive of their twelve free throws. Taking their third victory of the crn·ent campaign, the Perkinsmen last Saturday night eked out a 39-37 win ovei' the Hobart quintet in the Alumni Gym in a game which saw both sides play slow and ragged ball throughout. Union jumped to an early lead and stayed ahead .on all but two occasions, trailing twice by one point in the final period. It rolled up a ·big 19-9 halftime advantage, largely on Dingley's scoring and Bill Holstein's two beautiful set shots. Hobart took the lead, 37-36, with six minutes of play 1emammg.

The score- board held the score even at 40 and the clock indicated one second to go. Clapp, who had the ball, was fouled as the gun went off and his free throw accounted for the decid- ing tally. Not surprising to sports fans, in view of his presen.t performance, is the fact that Clapp held the record fo1· foul shots during his last year, sinking 54 for 72. He also dis- tinguished himself with an enviable average of over ten points per game during his final season. Clapp also delves in baseball with varsity ex- perience to his credit. He held down the hot spot for Ramsey. Clapp began his navy training at Union on July 1st, 1944, and has indicated his preference in the field of electrical engineering. ~---·------------------~ • • ' . . :NO FINER PLACE TO EAT I · !

The P-59A Airacomet, built by Bell Air- craft, is the first American version-- a single-seater, high-altitude fighter. The engines were developed by Gen- eral Electric from an original British design. The AAF assigned the job in 1941, and six months later the first jet engine in America, an aircraft gas turbine, was on test. The jet-plane doesn't haYe a propel- ler. What actually pushes the plane forward is the reaction to a high ,.eJoc- iry discharge of gases. It is just a practical application of one of Newton's laws, \-V hie h says that to eYery action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The engine has only one main moving part. Air is taken into the engine, compressed, and after its temperature is increased by burning fuel, hot gases are discharged through a tail pipe nozzle. When these gases push in one direction, the plane moves in the other. Gene1·al Electric CfJmpany, Schenectady 5, N. Y.

Dr. Fox pointed out in answer to a i question by Mr. Barr that these pre-\ paratory courses came as a result of a suggestion from the State De-l partment of Education. President Carmichael made clear I that Ohio plans evening courses in 1 high schools, and President Barr was of the opinion that this method would not work because there would be a lack of college atmosphere. Drs. Brown, Gaines and Fox agreed that there was great dan- ger in giving too much credit for military training. In the last war I many wartime degrees for men in the service did not have the back- ing of a completed college educa- tion.

If it passed again at the pres- ent 1945 session, this resolution can be submitted to the people for ap- proval or disapproval at the next general election. Opposition to this proposal, which the American Legion supports, comes mainly from those in Civil Service posi- tions through war time examina- tions. \It is regrettable,\ said Mr. Begley, \that certain people who have obtained Civil Service posi- tions through war time .examin- ations, with little or no opposition, as well as others, who have re- ceived frequent and speedy war time promotions and advancements, should, from the comforts of their positions and homes, direct opposi- tion to such a necessary amend- ment <to the New York State Con- stitution) and seek to deprive de- serving and qualified veterans now in fox holes, the opportunity of ob- taining employment and this slight token of our gratitude for the sac- rifices they have made.\ Group Last Tues. On Tuesday, January 9, the men of N. C. S. marched down to the new State Armory on Washington Avenue, where the Red Cross Blood Donors Center is located. Twenty- six men of the platoon completed donations. The trip was the result of ex-radioman 1/c Bill Licht's idea. The plan was approved by Lt. An- dreen. The last man had finished his donation by 1810 and all were treated to a dinner. The group re- ceived a 2230 libertv from the CO and compliments from Lt. Com- mandet• Jones for the .fine gesture. Some of the men could not donate ru; they were in the eight week waiting bracket between donations. One could not give because he had had malaria, and several will re- turn when they no longer have head colds. Bill Licht, the man who was awarded a Presidential Citation in chapel for his valorous actions while operating as a flat-top air- crew man in the South Pacific, has been down to the Blood Donor Cen- ter many times.

DeGraff, counsel to the Association of State Civil Serv- ice Employees of the State of New York, and the second speaker, ask- ed if it were possible to give some form of preference to veterans and at the same time maintain an ef- fective civil service system.

These luscious ladies will help in no little way to make our formal a big success. JIMMY PALMER Accompanied by the news an- nounced this week that Lee Castle will be unable to play for the \Win- terset'' formal due to an unexpected shift in band personnel, dance com- mittee co-chairman Dave Cohen re- vealed that a second band ha9 now been signed, that of Jimmy Palmer and his fast-climbing aggregation. Palmer is not to be considered a second choice, however, as his band has been met with an ever-increas- ing demand for engagements of late and has quite a string of very suc- cessft I runs listed in its log book. Palmer has bee11. featured as male vocalist with several name outfits. such as Bobby Byrne, Gracie Bar· rie, and Lou Breese. Jimmy started his musical career singing duets with Perry Como in Cannonsburg, Pa. Perry was the barber in the Palmer barber shop, and Jimmy was the football star of Cannonsburg High. It was Perry who got the break first, going to work for Ted Weems. Meanwhile Jimmy kept plugging and wonder- ing, was he destined to be a singer or a football star? The answer came soon enough when Bobby Byrne offered the vocal job to Jimmy Palmer. Bidding goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, Jimmy swt:ng onto the New York bus and bade goodbye to Cannonsburg. He didh't know it, but the next time he was to return, it would be with hi9 own great orchestra. With the Bobby Byrne orchestra, Jimmy gained much valuable exper- ience and finesse. He appeared with the band at all the top spots in the country, and it wasn't long before \Jimmy Palmer Fan Clubs\ sprang up in the Eastern United States. When the Byrne crew headed for Chicago and the Hotel Sherman, youngsters all through the mid-west crowded to the bandstand for auto- graphs of Bobby Byrne and Jimmy Palmer! Only the decision on the fate of the proposed Saturday afternoon record dances held in the Sigma Phi and the Alpha Delta Phi dorms is yet to be made, but according to the proctors of the two houses it is completely up to the men wishing to attend such affairs. If the latter are willing to make the arrange- ments to bring in records and a record player and also to clean up the rooms when they are through, the deal is on. The location of the booths wiJI be decided by the ticket representa- tives next Wednesday afternoon af- ter the Chapel program, and will be shown in next week's issue of the \Concordy for the convenience of all attending the big dance. Date Housing Men wishing to house their dates in the two collE\ge dorms set aside for that pw·pose, namely the Phi Gamma Delta and the Chi Psi houses, are requested by the com- mittee to give their names to the representative from whom they purchase their ticket, and arrange- ments will be made to have the girls stay in the houses Saturday after- noon and night and Sunday morn- ing. The chaperones for the affair were selected by the committee from the Navy and the civilian administra- tion buildings, and will be headed by Dr. and Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox and Lt. and Mrs. F. B. Andreen. James Vollmer is the committee member in charge. Broadcast From 9:30 P. M. until 10:00 P. M. tadio station WGFM will broadcast the music .of Jimmy Palmer and his band and arrangements have also been made by WGY to air the pro- ceedings from 11:30 to 12:00. The public address system used during the dance is to be operated through the courtesy of Union's own UCRS. ----01---- Inflation Is Discussed By Two Union Profs. Came Pearl Harbor and Byrne and Palmer headed together to the recruiting center. To the intense disappointment of the two pals, Jimmy was not accepted dt:e to a football injury. Bobby then disband- ed his band and Jimmy temporarily was out of work. But word had gotten around of the potentialities of the young singer and Gracie Barrie gave him the job of Male Professors Benjamin P. Whitaker and William W. Bennett spoke on inflation at a meeting of the League of Women Voters held at the Sche- nectady Y. W. C. A. on Wednesday afternoon, Jan. 10.

It was with Gracie that Jimmy Palmer became really !mown throughout the country. Gracie played at all the famous spots Bob- by Byrne had and the folks remem- bered Jimmy to a remarkable de- gree.

Little, too little, attention was paid to the announcement in last week's Con- cordy concerning the new hoaorary society. Few reade1·s appreciated what this society may 1mean to the college if its success proves its w01th as time goes by.

A great deal of credit is owec! the original eleven charter members for their liberal attitude and devo- tion to\vards the college. Orig·inally the idea grew out of a bull session in which the gen- eral trend of conversation was about the lack of cooperation the college received when vol- unteers were requested to usher at a chapel function. Added to this fault was the bewil- derment of a visiting team when it was not met at the station and had to straggle up to the campus without direction. Vnion is not alone in this error for when our teams have visited other schools they have been caught in the same predicament. The colleg-e offi- cials immediately accepted the idea and a constitution was drawn up with Robert I. Potter elected as the first President.

Dailey had t'wo open days between bands, Jimmy Palmer got the dates. Response was terrific. Fan mail poured in from all corne1·s of the nation. Old guard amusement men sat up and took notice. The Jimmy Palmer orchestra was on its way to the top. The exec~ tive::> at GAC se- cured the choice Chanticleer for Jimmy, a three weeks' booking with an option on an indefinite stay at the spot.

The uJtion cluu 1 incidentaUy, will be out for its first win on a ---~road trip. The latter have lost all BILL BAKER • · Fencers Square Off With LaSalle four of their away games so far, and the jinx may stiH be following them. On the other hand, the Engineers boast an enviable record, having chalked up wins over Brooklyn Poly, Trinity, Williams and Roch· ester. Last week they trounced a highly~tol:lted Rochester five by the lopsided score of 63-41. As the Navy bowling league· swings into the final stretch a look at the records finds the Tugs hang- ing grimly onto their precious one- game lead over the Subs and still resting precariously in the lO<Jp's initial spot. The Tugs last week managed to cop two of their three games from the Battlewagons and thus keep the top rating in their possession. It was in Albany and almost a couple of decades ago that Mr. Baker inquired excitedly of the ·doctor, \Boy or girl?\ \Athlete replied the clairvoyant medicine· man \laconically\. Doctors aren't alwa~·s wrong as is evidenced by 6 :eet~4 inches of Bill Baker at 2.24 ,lDunds per inch (That's 170 pounds). Bill is currently sparking the Gar- .1et cagers in the pivot slot, and visiting teams invaria!bly develop a healthy respect for his one-handed hook shot.

Now the Tankers' string of victories is up to six in a row. With both Ratcliffe and Szableski 1 tOlling games in the 200's the Subs 1 marched on, but partial blame for the Destroyers' poor showing may be la.id to Pete Manzo's two games in the 90's and Chuck Kelly's bril- liant 99. Jack Austin, who rolled the day's high triple of 524, led the P. T.'s to a two-out-of-three win over the Carriers, now holding down the loop's seventh spot. I Three more men hit the 200 mark I last week. bringing the \200\ club to a total of eight. The new addi- tions to the club are Szableski, who filed a 223, Ratcliffe, pulling down a 222, and Austin, who just barely sneaked in by the side door with an even 200. Also, last week a new member was added to the Hall of Shame.

Not without thrills, the Milne lads found themselves deadlocked at 35-al! in an encounter with Albany Academy with only twelve seconds to go. Baker brought the game out of the fire with a hook shot from the foul line. Another of their wins was chalked up against Christian Broth- ers Academy who had dropped only one game in sixteen. Baker and the boys froze the ball throughout the final quarter to win 24-20.

The teams' first .neeting was won by the homesters, ~1-5. One handicap the Dutchmen will .tave, however, is that their coach .. md probably their ablest fencer, Jim Marstet•s, will be unable to com- ..:ete in the match. Union completely outclassed La .lal!e in the previous contest, walk- ing off with an overwhelming score. The tentative match with the U. S. Military Academy is still set for Jebruary 3 at West Point, Coach .Marsters announced this 'Week. The We~t Pointers boast a potent fenc- ing crew and for that reason Mars- tus is taking along all eight of his swordsmen on the trip. He also stated that he is still trying to swing a match with Co- lumbia Univer~ity, and that he got an answer from Harvard recently in reply to his inquiry for a match, explaining that that school has given up fencing for the duration. \The squad is still very short of equipment,\ revealed Marsters, \and the Athletic Department refuses to support us with funds. All our re- quests for new equipment must go through the Student Finance Com- mittee.\ terest is an episode that occurred in a Milne vs. Cathedral Academy game. Flip Dowling, who reffed at the Alumni Gymnasium for the Col- gate and Columbia games this sea- son, counted to four in the foul column in ten minutes from start- ing time and retired Baker for the evening. Baker is looking forward to the electrical engineering curriculum here at Union which he began on July 1st, 1944, as an apprentice sea- man. , _______________________ ... , Jimmy Salmon, push-shot artist of the '43-44 Garnet five, turned out to be the stumbling block for the visitors last Saturday night at Stevens Tech as he swished through sevein field goals and two free throws for a big total of sixteen points, a score just half that pried up by the Perkinsmen. Transferred to the engineering school by navy orders, So:lmon and his sixteen markers took scoring honors for the night for both teams, while little 16-year-old Al Dingley ~opped the runner-up spot with a 'otal of fourteen. Dingley is now far and away the leading scorer for the Union club, having scored sixteen markers in the previous two games and f<mr- teen in last Saturday's tussle. The Techsters were on top in the scoring column all through the con- test, with their high-watet· mark a 43-24 margin at the end of the third period. Summary: Stevens G.

COLLEGE DEFERMENTS The National War Service Act is the in- strument with which the l!nited States might he:u;ten the eventual defeat of Get·- many. Because of the complexity 0f Amer- ica's manpower problems ou1· military forces m·e faced with a probable insufficiency of supplies in the near future. Secondly, we must prove to om· enemies that despite our recent reverses they have no chance whatso- ever of achieving a peace on their terms. But most important of all, we must give to our fighting men, m the mud and snow of Eu- J'ope, and the filth and heat of the far Paci- fie, the assurance that his country is cogniz- ant of his needs. The ::\ ational War Service Act could accomplish these absolute require- ments. Our soldiers face dangers besides the legal bindings enforced upon them-the civilian populace should at least be bound leg·ally to do their share. All of our resources should ue utilized to the fullest extent. If we are to utilize our resources wisely, then an educational deferment mecha:nism should be incorp01·ated in the Act. What the college men of toda~· do and feel m their laler capacity as engineers, businessmen, teachers, and parents will determine the his- tory of America during the post-war period. 0Ul's is a. technological age and technical men are needed to plan, build, and operate its machines. The colleges, in their education the committee for preparing such a wonderful evening, particularly under the strained circumstances that they have been working.\ A.S. John M. Hicltey responded, \The band is even 'better than I thought it would be. The 'lrresis- tibles' are as the name implies.\ B:ll Lu<\as replied. \This is a fine dance, and· everyone seems to be having a fine time. It has been a good weekend, with a bit of extra activity to go long with the formal. I just hope that we can have many more of them as the terms go by.'' A.S. Tom Reid stated, \It appears that the dance committee spa1·ed no pains to make this a dance which we wi-ll long remember. I am ~ure that everyone is having the time of their life.\ A.S. Raymund Le Rue declared, \This is the best dance that I've ever been to at Union College. Jimmy Palmer certainly has a fine orchestra. The decorations are 'tops'.\ Mid<ohipman Craig F. MitchPII, f01·mer Editor of The Concordiensis, visiting Union from Fort Schuyler, asserted. \I'm certainly glad to at- tend another formal at Union, par- ticularly as fine a one as this.

Many other colleges were forced to suspend them. However, l'nion has thus far been able to carQ· on. The policy of having one ball each term has as yet found no exception. Let us hope that it may be continued. Thank the committee - they helped to make this dance a success.

They come fl'Om l\lidshipmen Schools, they come from graduate schools, they come from bases all over the east. They are not here because they have to be here. They are here because they want to be here. These men have re- turned to their Alma :Mater m search for old memories and old friends. Give them a salute, give them a fe\\-' words and a hand-- 1 shake, for they will appreciate it. ~ \\' Union has seen many men pass through its hoary walls, and these men het·e tonight are but a few. If we are Union men, we should make them know it, and help them to appreciate the friendliness of thei1· former home . .:\lost of them cannot come and go at their own will now, and it has meant much planning and concentration on their part to > be here tonig-ht.

On Friday, Feb. 9, they will play for the Navy \Happy Hour\ a smoker and entertain- ment' to be given for the V-12 Unit at the Alumni Gym. About forty new arrangements, including all the Ia test favorites, have been purchas- ed and will be presented on these dates. The USO dance, scheduled to begin about one-half hour after the basketball game with Stevens here will be open to all servicemen. Mr. Regnier, chairman of the USO, has announced that any servicemen who have dates for the game may bring them to the USO afterwards. As always, there will be plenty of junior hostesses on hand to enter- tain the men who come alone. At present the orchestra is sound- ing unusually smooth in their re- hearsals, although they are still short a trumpet player.

This discussion was led by E. 0. Shreve, Vice-President of the General Electric Company: A. N. Woodhead of the New York Power and Light Corporation, Al- bany; and W. J. Culihan of the Al- bany Packing Division of the Tob- in Packing Company. Charles H. Touhey, president . of the Albany Chamber of Commerce, presided at the evening meeting. An informal All College record dance was held this afternoon in the Sigma Phi House. It was a scene of pre-prom activity and in- cluded representatives from nearly every ship and dorm on Campus. The whole ground floor of this civi- lian dormitory was transformed into one dance floor, and was well used nearly all afternoon. The residents of this house did all the work, on their own initia- tive, and should be commended. Proctor Tobin was the host of the aftet·noon. Regardless of the varied group of Navy and civilian atten.dant~, an air of informality and fnendlmess pervaded the scene. Colorful dresses of the many in and out of town dates provided the decora- ti-ons. Navy men arrived shortly after the weekly inspection. Civi- lians drifted in between 2 P. M. and 4 P.M. . ., The Classical Record 1·ecitals which are sponsored by the Faculty Women's Club are held on a request basis. This state- ment is to clarify and correct the illusion created by the Concordy by the use of the word \Con- cert.\ The recitals are held in the chapel from 1830 to 2000 on Thursday evenings. Requests for specific music desired is to be made at the desk of the Nott Memorial Library. Dr. Samuel Caved To Deliver Sermon National President of Kappa Alpha, Also a Union College Trustee Dr. Samuel McC1·ea Cavert, gen- eral secretary of the Fed.eral ·Coun- cil of Churches of Christ in Amer- ica since 1921, will deliver the ser- mon at the regular Union College chapel service Sunday morning, Jan. 21, at 11:00. Dr. Cavert, who was born in Charlton, N. Y ., is a graduate of Schenectady High School, Union College, and Umon Theological Seminary in New York City. He was secreta1y of the stu- dent Y. M. C. A. and instmctor of G1·eek at Union CoBege from 1910 to 1912, later teaching at Union Theological Seminary. He is na- tional president of Kappa Alpha, the oldest national fraternity in the United States which was founded at Union College in 1825. Dr. Cavert is a member of the board of direc- tors of Union Theological Seminary and is a trustee of Union College. Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh will be at the organ and the service will be broadcast from Memorial Chapel at 11:15 by WGY. Prof. F. C. Schmidt In Chapel Program .. Why Talk Russian\ Talk Both Educational and \Punny\ The dance on the whole was a howling success, and we can only hope that the precedent will be fol- lowed in the future . Adds Spa,-kle and Punch Professor Frederick C. Schmidt presented to the students of Union College an interesting talk. \Why Learn Russian,\ a:t Wednesday Chapel, January 17, 1945. In quest of a date with a Mosca- vile glamor girl, Dr. Schmidt ad- mitted that one would have to do somE\ talking to get along. So why not learn Russian? The Russian alphabet of 32 letters can easily be learned in one-half hour and the language as a whole is not difficult. Professor Schmidt's interest in Russian came as a result of his own curiosity. This self-study proved so interesting that he still continues to unravel its mysteries. Because of the large number of extremely valuable scientific works written in Russian, it is decidedly advantageous to learn this langu- age of the U. S. S. R. Future inter- national relations both in the poli- t-ical and economic fields may large- lv depend upon the ability -of Amer- (cans to understand fluently the Russian language. ~---0•---- C.

An Informal scene at a former engagement of the orchesti·a that appears in Alumni Gym tonight. The \Inesistibles\ which have added g 1 ·eatly to the joy and gaiety of the big evening appear at the left. Palmer, the maestro of the hour, seen at the right, has been in the rarest of form all evening, and from all appearances will continue to liven up thP evening. JT'interset 'Ork' Leader ° Comm:itteemen Spo:rt Red Sashes JIMMY PALMER 235 Union College Town Meeting Topic Is, \Should the United States Continue Electoral College?\' M:Usic: Definitely Tops. lrresistibles Likewise The gigantic Winterset Formal is under way, and the Gym is burst- ing with gaiety. The decorations here tonight reflect the professional touch that the Committee strove so hard to attain. Two broadcasts are being made, one going over the ether by way of the FM :otation WGFM while the other will hold the attention of mo.ny thous- ands in the Capitol area and throughout the country as it goes out over WGY. These broadcasts follow the precedent of the Gridiron Ball in October, 1944, when Jackson Teagarden broadcast over these same two stations, making it the first time in Union's history that a formal had been broadcast over two different stations on the same even- in g. Theme The theme of the formal here to- night is a familiar -one to us all who have experienced the last week's weather in this vicinity. Yes, as the name denotes, we are in the center of a winter wonderland that we will remember as the Winterset Formal. At the 235th Union College Town Meeting last Sunday afte1·noon the question: \Should the United States Continue to Maintain the Electoral College •\ was answered by the statements of two college repre- sentatives. The first speaker was Dr. Harold W. Stoke, President of the University of New Hampshire, who was inaugmated the tenth president of that -institution but last month, and the second speaker was a member of the Boston Uni- versity faculty, Dr. Edward Rupert Collier, Associate Professor of So- cial Science. The Prom Committee is well rep- resented here tonight, as you all have noticed by the brilliant array of red sashes that add to the gay color scheme of the Winterset. Cohen and Hempton, the strong- arm Co-chairmen, are rightfully proud of the garnet sashes that adorn their swollen chests. \Tuck\ Tucker is here too, and is happy about the whole thing, as he very wen might be. His job was that of decorations, and his efforts are easily discernable. \Red\ Vollmer is on hand with the rest of this happy group, and he as well, is sporting the gay red bow \Hank\ Levy, of the great three, is here to- night in all his glory, sporting that \ear to ear\ grin that seems per- manent. Cal Simmons, our indus- trious E. E., the lad who blew his first fuse at the age of 5, is here taking in ali the sights. Lee Akins is here too, and is adding his happy nature to the gaiety of the evening. Last, but not least, of the Commit- tee representatives here tonight, is John Carlson. John is the gleaming individual that has been noticed in the center of the floor, followed by that gleam of incandescent light. PalmPr and Company The dance tonight is highlighted by the presence of a great new band and bandleader. Palmer has given out with some real danceable music tonight, and as we can all easily see, is a band that is headed for the top. The \Irresistables\ are more than adding to the color of the prom, and all we can say- is~ show us more. Dr. Stoke stated that \we must remembe1· that the Electoral Col- lege was invented by men who were unanimous in their distrust of the judgment of the masses of the peo- ple. The fact remains that the Elec- toral College still shows some un- democratic characteristics and undemocratic effects.

Skating in from Lake Placid we have Miss Bette King and her nearby neighbor from Know your Campus HALE HOUSE Thet·e are two main objectives in writing this column on Hal!! House; Union's dining haH and lounges. The first is to bring to you the factual data of the background and building of Hale House. The second objective is to try to convey to you what Hale House actually stands for, and also tell you something about the pat·t which the people who lived there before it was re- made into a dining hall played in the history of Union College. Let us start at the very begin- ning. South Colonade !or South Col- lege as it is often called) was con- stl'ucted at the same time that the school was built, in 1814. The wing, where Hale House now stands, was completed in 1854. The first resident of the new wing was Dr. Eliphalet Nott. who tool' possession in 1861. In 1864, Professor Morris Pel'kins, together with his wife and family, set up residence in the South wing. After Professot· Pel'kins' death in 1902, Dr. Edward Everett Hale, Jr., with his wife and famfly, be- came the thil'd family to live in the extension of South College. Mrs. Hale was the former Rose Perkins, daughter of Professor M. Perldns. Mrs. Hale's mothet· also lived with the Hales. When Dr. Hale passed on in 1932, Prof. David Morse moved into the wing. When war broke out, and it was decided that Union should have a Navy unit, a Navy mess hall was constructed immediately in back of and < onnected to Hale House. This new dining hall was completed in time for the July term of 1943. The enlarged kitchen was fol'merly Dr. Nott's barn. Now let us consider the second, and perhaps most important objec- tive of this. article. Perhaps the best way to approach the subject would be to tell something of the lives of some of the people who lived in Hale House; the people who ga-ve it the meaning that it has today. Professor Morris Perkins was a campus notable. No less distinguish- ed, however. was his wife; known to the students as \The Dutchess.\ Professor Perkins was a professor of chemistry. He was noted for his shrewdness and for his out-spoken character. * * SC Lower The lads from Lower South Col- lege turned up with some rare beauties for the dance. The Dutch town of Schenectady presents us with Miss Lorraine Malo, Miss De- lores Winckler, Miss Arlene Duval, Miss Minnie Craig, Miss Jerry Cesare, Miss Polly Stevens and Miss J Rose Paracella <who's that \curley- · headed\ lad with her?). The Uni- versity of Rochester sends as its envoy Miss Janet Schoonmaker while not far from Syracuse come Miss Marianne Barron and Miss 1 Sally Harvey. Missouri sends us a, gal that's gotta be shown in the person of Miss Nancy Nelson.' Here's one for the books. From' Ithaca comes the one and only Miss : Carol Jandaevundakovitch. <We· hope we have the spelling correct!) The \rip-roaring\ city of Albany honors Union with Miss Joy Kin- kaid, Miss Doris Solomon and Miss Ruth Supck. Miss Helene Cahill, travels here from the shirt city of l Troy, N. Y., while Miss Helene\ Graplroski comes from the Mosquito Flats of Jersey City, Jersey. Chi Psi The second term freshies haven't been around much but they man- aged to squeeze in just the same. All their dates are from other in- stitutions of learning. Larson Col- lege in New Haven, Conn., sends us Miss Ruth Skinner and Russell Sage, Miss Jan Gocdrich. From Albany State Teachers College comes Miss Pat Buckley and from Nott Terrace here in Schenectady, comes Miss Bernice Felthousen. NCNS I I Mrs. Perkins, alias \The Dutch- ess,\ was a huge woman. She had large features and could always be seen wearing a lace cap. She Javed flowers, and so she naturally had a very beautiful, old-fashioned gar- den. The garden today is known as \Mrs. Perkins Garden.\ The grounds were redone by our own Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox, upon her ar- rival at Union. From Parkchester, an interesting place, comes Miss Lorraine Reiner. The Capital City raises its curfew for the weekend so that the Misses Peggy Daly, Ann Sehl and Jean. .Sharkey could be here tonight. A Rose Perkins Hale, wife of Dt·. Hale, was very different in many respects fl'om her mother. Mrs. future Powers model is Miss Jane Carruthers who is up from her school at Merion. Pa.

Mr. Baker had one of the country's leading interior decorators work- ing on the new project, and as the saying goes, \money was no ob- ject.\ Hale was very beautiful and petite.

The official designation of this smoker is \Happy Hour\. Dante M. Scaccia and Donald :M. Kanter are heading the Committee responsible for its success. The af- fair will be held at the Alumni Gymnasium at a time that will be announced in the next issue of the Concordy. Extra Liberty Featured on the bill will be five boxing, and two wrestling matches that are to take place between North and South Colleges. The Col- lege winning the majority of these matches will be granted special lib- erty t:ntil 2400 at a future date. En- tries are advised to see D. Kanter. Also featured on the program is the newly formed V-12-Civilian Dance Band. The boys promise to give out with the soft and low ae well as the hot and jumpy. It has been noted that Lowell Brown will do the vocalizing. To supplement Brown, a quartet is now practicing the songs we all want to hear. Other Features Many other features are prom- ised that will delight the audience. Included in these are, a comedy boxing match, displays of musical talent, and last but not least, a strip-tease act. The Committee has gone through many hardships and has broken every Naval Regulation, to secure this t:nusual entertain- ment for the men. As for a descrip- tion of the two \strippers\-sexy ie the only word that can ·be used. It is the hope of the members of the committee that word of these art- ists doesn't get spread around too much-after all the gym can hold a limited number of men. Refreshments Free soft drink9 and cookies will be served at the Happy Hour and to all hands, free cigarettes will be distributed. If this goes over ·big, the skipper has promised us more of the same type of entertainment in the future.

Group weather officer, Orton's job is a highly important one. Weather is the greatest determining factor in the success or failure of a mission and the turbulence throughout this theater is extremely rough and unpredictable. The job calls for deep research, shrewd an- alysis and the ability to forecast. New Fronts \There's nobody who can get him- self more on the spot than a wea- ther officer,\ said Orton. \In this theater, particularly, the crews are constantly faced with new fronts. The Alps, Appenines, the long Italian ranges and the Bavarian Alps are great ltettles for brewing up storms and' extremely turbulent fronts. Winter only intensifies the problem of weather.\ Orton is firm in his belief that a practical approach to weather is as important to a pilot or naviga- tor as good engines. With this in mind he devoted 10-hours of indi- vidual instruction to each flying officer. Union Grad A product of Washington Acad- emy, Salem, and a graduate of Union College, '42, Orton studied meterology at New York University and received his commission in May, '43.

STUPIDITY It has been brought to the attention of the Concordiensis, by the All College Disciplin- ary Committee, that the false fire alm·m that directed the Schenectady Fire Department to the l'nion Campus two weeks ago ma~· have been through the perverted efforts of some civilian undergraduate. If such was the case, thb publication has a few words to say concrming such action. Union should evel' have harbored such an individual, or individuals. College ag·e should not be an age of complete irresponsibility. The past term has given too much evidence to the contrary. Yom editor, interested in obtaining expert opinion on such matters, conferred with Chief Higgins of the Schenectady Fire De- purtment. Chief Hig;gins stated conceming a false alarm, \It is a terrible thing. We have found that more accidents happen on a false alarm than at any other time.\ He further disclosed that such an alarm costs the city a}l(i its taxpayers upward from $i'i0.00. Costs of oil, gasoline, labor, and general deprecia- ti•m are not the only disadvantages of a false alarm. Such a call removes crucial equipment from the m·ban area, and can cause serious repercussions if another fire should occur. College men, or ~·outh who delight in being: called college men, are supposedly above the mentality of the mass of youth at their age. We a1·e all colleg-e men, all of us who attenrl classes within Cnion's hoary walls. :\lost of us wear that name with pride; perhaps some of us wear tlta t name under false pre- tenses. \\'e cannot definitely state that this serious offence, already stated above, was committed by someone within ou1· student body. If, however, such vagranc;v did spring from within our group, we a1·e ashamed tlwt Stupidity can be the only cause of such <Ul alarm. Let any individuals who might be involved take note. THE To the Editors: I wish to call a fact to your at• tention which in my opinion is very important. I have noticed upon re- peated occasions that the main doors of the Memorial Chapel are not all unlocked at Wedneeday Afi- semblies or Sunday Chapels. Some- times two are open and sometimes only one. This condition is not per- missible. In case of an emergency it would be impossible to clear the Chapel of students in the reqt ired time. Only two students at the most can pass through the middle door at any one time. Thus the passing out of the student body is a very slow process, reeulting in considerable conJusion at the end of every assembly period. It Is, of course, a fact that the LETTER BOX Chapel is a \'ery modern and safe may !;'eem today, may be overlooked building.

JOHN GODFREY rou:ncl off the weekend schedule bi>mm-row night in the Gym with Stevens Tech. Stevens previ-@•~-----­ Coach and ·Director i1n Powwow Johnny Godfrey is in the home- stretch of his navy training here at Union and figures to complete his gold-braid preparation for Deck Officer next month. By that time he will have completed his per- formances as guard on Coach Jesse Perkins' Garnet Cagers. -Courte.sy Heheneetaciy Cnion-I::Har ously downed the Dutchmen in the two squads' first meeting earlier in Tankers Ton Navy the season on the formers' home· '1:' court to the tune of 49-32.

Salmon 'cha·lked. up seven field goals and two free throws against the home- sters in the previous Union-Stevens ·game for a total of 16. , The Union team will be out for its fourth win of t·he season tonight, having lost five games in a row now, one of which was to Stevens Tech, while Worcester has an inverse · 1 record. having won five games in a row. They lost their first two tussles of the season, one to Lowell Gen- era!i Hospital and the other to Brown. Stevens also boasts an enviable record, sporting four wins against one loss. Their one loss was to La•Fayette, 47-40. The Engineers beat their Alumni, 29-24, Webb In- stitute by 47-26, Drew 37-24, and Union 49-32. The Tankers came through last Saturday afternoon when the chips were down and knocked off Jack Stitt's last-place Carriers in all three games to emerge victors in the Navy Bowling League. It was a .fast loop from start to finish in the closing day of the tourney, being close all the way through. Up until two weeks ago, the Tankers were never even con- sidered to come out in the upper brackets, but they, including mem- bers Bob Flesher, Don Harrington, Zeke Zwiren, and Dave Demarest, really turned on the heat and won 11 of their last 12 games. As only one man on the team is in the first Len individual scorers, it is natural to assume that it was spirit and de- termination which drove the Tank- ers into the initial spot. Godfrey began a colorful sports career at Kingswood School in West Hartford, Connecticut, par- tJcipating in the three major sports for four years. Starting on the first rung in football, Johnny worked out for a year on the Freshman. team before filling substitute roles on the varsity. Making routine progress, he completed the last two In the Dutchmen'9 previous two meets, both against LaSalle in a horne-and-home series, the Garnet came out on top by scores of 11-5 and 11-2, but the Columbia match is considered by most observers to present more of an obstacle to the Union team than the caliber of ep- position met heretofore. Five to seven men will make the trip to New York City for the meet, Marsters said, depending on how many men the Lions are fielding for the match. Possibilities of a match with New York Univer·sity are also being con- sidered, it was revealed. years of J. V. ball with an equal number on the varsity. Godfrey held the number one position and I recalls pitching Kingswood to vic- tm·y over a home town rival of 10,000 students. Jot.nny was one of 200 students at JOngswood. The Worcester's wins were over Con- necticutt 51-49, M. I. T. 40-37, Harvard 53-45, AmericaFt Interna- tional 87-28 and Harvard again 60-37. Het•e Athletic Director Hal Wittner and Basketball Ooach Jt>ss Perkins put their heads together to talk oyer the basketball situation. Perkins' charges have dropped five straight tussles and will be out for their fom·th win this weeliend when they face Worcester and Last Saturday night while the ma- . jortty of Union was enjoying the --------------- big prom weekend, the Garnet The Destroyers had a good day and toppled the Tugs from first place by taking their series, 2-1. !'his enabled the Destroyers to en- ter the ledger in a dead heat with the Tugs for the sec.and place posi- tion.

Investigation re- vealed that they had ten wins in as many starts with Godfrey getting credit for seven of them. \Almost had a no-hitter,\ mused Johnny. \There were two out in the last inning and the third baseman muffed one.

In an en- counter with Westminster School, Kingswood took the ball over the line midway during the game to even the score at 12. Godfrey threw a pass for the extra point which, incidentally, was the last score of the game. Godfrey completed two terms with the Bluejackets at Villanova at Philadelphia before coming to Union. At heart, he's a music lover and delights in playing records. He also plays the piano. With the Gophers and the C-1~ --------- Subs .......... 11 10 Hogans leading the civilian and national intramural basketball lonps, respectively, the winter court program's fifth week draws to a close tomorrow in the gym when four matches are slated to be run off. In the biggest upset of the sea- son, the lowly Oldgym squad turned back the highly-touted -off- campus Gophers last night by the slim margin of 27-26. The Oldgym aggregation was figured all the way t0 take a drubbing, but their one- point margin of victory gave them their third victory in six starts. The Hogans, now pacing the Na- tional League with three wins, have two more games left, ·one with the Eager Heavers on Feb. 3 and the other with the Sad Sacks, who boast a not-so-enviable record of no wins and five defeats. The B-2 Blazers are still out in front of the pack in the American League with a clean ledger of three-and-none, foliowed closely by the Terriers, who sport a 3-1 slate. The previously-disputed game be- tween the C-1 Hogans and the B-1 Penguins was settled at a man- agers' meeting last Monday, the body deciding that the contest should be adjudged a tie. The final count of this game was 24-20.
