The series of eight broadcasts be- ing sponsored by the International Relations Club was inspired by the letters received from listeners last year In this country and abroad in comment upon the fom· discussions that took place ovet· .the air early in 1936. Students and radio officials were moved not only to continue the series -but to double frequency of the broadcasts. Intended to convey \What Amer- ican College Men Are Thinking .About Domestic and International Problems,'; the series was inaugur- ~ted by an introductory talk by President Dixon Ryan Fox.

Snyder, president of the club, and Ruszkowski took opposite sides, aided by Professor Ft;ank J.

Defending the \intangible values\ such as the acquisition of \a more intelligent understanding of human problems,\ and admitting that ma- terial success was needed after col- lege, Snyder contended that college · itself was most v~uable for other S'l;la:IO!lS, Then a.Jtd Now When she first entered the em-' pi<>y of the college as a chamber- ~ T A • d O • h B .

The use of films instead of the original old and rare volumes, said Mr. Webb, Is now employed by re- search workers in libraries all over the world. Old brittle pages are constantly crumbling with the time and with the wear and tear of thumbing, and the film copies which are taking their places, are serving to preserve the rare tomes. The machine is an advantage to the user, Mr. Webb, also stated, be- cause of the saving of expense. Where the volume itself would cost hundreds of dollars, the film copies of the book, complete in every de- tail, cost only a few dollars. The \Optigraph\ can project the small films up to•12, 16 and 24 diam- eters.

What with the Sanday Chapel broadcast and Dr. 'ridmarsh's shod wave recital every week, and the radio debates which occur regularly, Union is becoming· a by-word on the air. But m:ore important than this is the fact that the.se programs represent eJCcellent tal- ent and publicize the exceptional ability of those who are associated with the broad- cast:;. We can not commend them, the par- ticipants in this g-reat enterprise too highly, and we hope that the futme will hold in store for them the same measure of success as the past. FIFTY YEARS OF SERVICE Issue Editor ••....•.•.•.. Carl R. Trahman On February 1, 1886, the colleg·e added a new chambermaid to the cleaning- staff. For fifty years the name remained on the pay- roll, first as a chambermaid, finally as super- intendent of the cleaning staff and caretaker of Silliman Hall and the Administration Building. w.

She has known eight of DUl' fifteen BE A FRIEND IN DEED It is needless, not to say impossible, tu describe the deva:->lating ex. tent of the flood~. unprecedented in theit· magnitude, along the Ohio and ;,\lississippi rivers, which have driven the inhabitants of this area from their homes and have destt·oyed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property. Count- less thousands of these refugees are at the mercy of our benevolent nation. The Red Cross, and other charital>le and even non- charitable organiza;tions have s t r i v e n through monetary resources as well as human to alleviate .suffering, and to adminis- ter aid where m:ost needed. But the burden of this tremendous responsibility can not fall on the shoulders of a few; the whole nation must feel honor bound to give succor to its striken compatriots. Perhrrps it is unique for colleges to undertake a rwogram for flood relief, but it is not outside the realm of pos- sibility. Why in what bette1· way could they show evidence of their worthiness than in time of need to be \johnny un the spot\ with aid? Therefore we urge that the students co- operate with l\lr. Paffrath to collect money and clothing for the benefit of the flood suf- ferers. In fraternity hou~t>~ can be found any amount of old clothing which may not be suitable to \Vear to Sunday Chapel, but which will gil·d the loins <lf some poor re- fugee in Ohio or Missouri sufficiently to keep him warm, if one were to take the bother to look for it.

Those who live in town can b-ring what they can find at home to members of the Student Relief Committee, or contribute at one of the daily chapels at which time a collection will be made. All of us ought io dig down in our pockets and assist in some way or other. Rememeer that there were Union men in the past who made greater sacrifices than these which we are urging you to make, witness for what the Memorial Chapel stands. pl'esidents, most of OUI' alumni, all of our ups and downs. In a sense, her record has made her more than ~tn employe-in l'eality a part of the gl'oup of personalities and ideas tha.t 1nake up a college. What we could say about !\Irs. J\Ielher has already been suid br :\Ir. \\'alte1· :\Ia.in, in the :-\chenectady Union-Star: Hats off tu \Aunt Kate\ \vhu fur fifty years has contributed to the health, happi- ness and creature comforts of generations of l!nion College students! Such endurance outlasting the administrations o.f eight presi- dents, can be traced to only two things, namely an abiding sense of humor, and sound common sense. As l\Irs. Kate Melbe1 retires, after tidying up the rooms of the most notoriously and .exasperatingly untidy sort of boys in the world, she leaves two ideas to ponder. One is that the general l'U11 of students is about the same as at any tim~-: fur fifty years; and the other tlwt great le.s,;on which anybody can learn, the a1i of glorifying commonplace things. At Other Colleges . . . Muoic ha~ sufficil'nt char·m to lure students at CORNJ:t;LL UNIVERSITY away from all other col- IPgP activitie:-; to a degree exceeded only by inte - collegiate spm t. Almost lO~f of the student body participates in vocal and instrumental activitie Tt is offers a direct contrast to the opinion now held by many that college students favor the \music gnPs round and round\ type of music. * * * LAFAYETTE COLLEGE students cariied out an old tradition last week. It seems that during exam- ination period the students do not shave. The theory is that during these hectic days there is no time fo-r such trivialities. Perhaps thi:s is the origin of all the bem ds that blossorr.ed out on tl:e campus during our exams. • * • Twenty-three UNIVERSITY of MAINE seniors have just finished proving that they are men. EaJ:!h year the members of the forestry class spend nine weeks in the University's woodland winter camp testing out the classroom principles and getting a good J}I'actical knowledge of their future wo-rlr. The ca.rnp provides an acid test as .to whether or not the men are fitted for the forestry profession. * * *' LEHJGH seniors are given a chance to learn how to land a job. A series of lectures and three demon- stration interviews are given to the seniors by prominent employers in the induatr•ial world in order to help the men to carry themselves pretperly In the presence of an interviewer.

RUMOR HAS IT HAIL THE ROTARY-The Ro· tary Club of Schenectady, in its campaign to promote international good-will (see speech by D. R. Fox on subject via short wave) initiated four more students two weeks ago. Time was, in the days when P. A. Smith reigned amid the Bailey Hall 300's, an act like that would bring metaphorical fire and brimstone and intellectual excommunication. But recent emphasis on practical politics, as taught in the S. S. divi- sion, seems to have changed the at- titude of the student body. Also, the civic underwriting of the Festival might also make the college more receptive.

As one gets· deeper and leeper into an analysis of these !'elations one tends to think only of the resultant or int{'rnationul aspects of them. We sometimes for- get that nations are acting as ln- dh'iduals and their actions .toward Jther countries w.ill be determined ,by .their inherent .nature. It is felt by mo-st that it is no mere coin- cid'ence that a nation of born in- ·dividualists such as the United States should remain aloof from wodd cooperation. 'Fundamentally, therefore, com pletely efficien-t and peaceful ·in tem.ational relatio.ns and coopera- tion depends entirely on those hu- man beings comprising the various 1ations. Logically, then, the abHity nf pee>plf' within a country to co :>perate and g-et along peacefully with themselves will be mirrored in their attitude toward outsiders Hence, if the world is to progress as a unit every living person mus-t develop a modus vivendi a way ot .g-etting along with others in spite ·of great difficulties. What a pity it is that this point Is overlooked. So completely are ·we absorbed in our daily routine that we forget the effect of our actions on others \Vho may have nothing to do with us. Yet like molecules we move together in our restric-ted medium and cause fric tion. In spite of this almost every where we observe the trend in civ ilizati<>n toward world brotherhood T.hat statement may- seem absurd in the light of present international (!Onditions; however, it is not meant that this trend will be realized universally in the near future. On the contrary, it may take hundreds '>f yea1s. But the seed has been mwn; some of the wiser men, who \>.ng ago sensed that science was ~hanging the world, now begin to see that this metamo.rphosis has also unde1·mined time-worn con ception of life. Thus as light seeps through, it 1·eveals an earth of pe<>ple who are physically vcry near; now, thev must become near spiritually if !hey are to survive, and there's no I'E'ason to believe they won't. It is in this struggle to form a world brotherhood that international rc~ lations mu~t bP considered in time :o.come. -------- ------------- ----- -- Whatever political activity the1'e is seems to come out of their lounge. The deep-laid plots of neutrals to capture the elections, or fratem- ities to beat neutrals, arise there. 1\.bsolutely impartial, they espouse 'lny side that will provide a good ~ussle. They have even brought politcis into the Newman Club. R H T ANTI-RED? - As regards the Newman Club, it was reported in 'he papers that it was designed to combat campus Communism, at the special request of Pope Pius. The locals have said nothing on the subject. Probably, since no Com- m uuists have shown themselves here, they won't, but in any case they would be wiser, as a religious group, to let it alone.

The play will then be in the hands of stage manager Ferdi- nand Helm, Jr., until Mr. Adams re- t uz·ns to establish residence here on February 19. He will stay until the production on March 12, 13 and 15. This week, and the rehearsal to- morrow night at 7:30 o'clock, will be devoted to the memorization of lines, to facilitate Mr. Adams' work with the individual actors on their characterizations. On the technical side of the pro- duction, tentative scene designs and stage plots have already been drawn up, and construction work will probably begin next week under the direction of stage car- penter Carlton Garrison. One of the most difficult sets to be used in the campus playhouse, the designs call for much actual building work. ---0--- Union Debaters To Meet Tufts, Fordham This Week Resolved: \That the policy of re- ciprocal trade agreements is bene- ficial to the foreign trade of the United States\ is the subject of the debate between Tufts College and Union to be broadcast over WGY at 11:30 o'clock Thursday night. Lon Barringer '39 and Robert Wal- ter '39 will defend the negative side against Tufts in this decision debate. On Friday, Burns F. Barford, Jr., '37 and Guy A. Graves, Jr., '<!7 will represent Union against Ford- ham at a debate in New York. The subject of this match will be re- solved: '\That Congress should be empowered to fix minimum wages and maximum hours for industry.\ Union will present the affirmative side of the case. • Social Studies Students Favor Exams For Others Whole-hearted enthus•iasm and support of the mid-year examinations were expressed by students in the Social Studies division yesterday, when the Concordiensis i n t e r v i e w e d many of these men who had spent an intensive and hectic week of inactivity. \T hni! !'he of th<'m,\ !\nirl n Social Studies senior, \but S.

First \Winterset\ Rehearsal Tonight Adams Arrives From New York; Cast Expected to Know Lines by 7:30 Bruce Adams, who is directing the Mountebanks Theat1:e these days, will arrive this afternoon to conduct his first rehearsals for Maxwell Anderson's prize play \Winter·set which will be p!Q· duced in the campus playhouse on March 12, 13 and 15. With the cast slated to know their lines by 7:30 o'clock ton·ight, Mr. Adams expects to be able to block out all the business of the play and help the individual ac- tors with the problems of their cha1·acterizations. All in all, it will be a busy week- end for the Mountebanks. Rehear- sals will probably be held nQt only tonight but tomorrow afternoon and night as well, with a very good possibility of at least one Sunday rehearsal. SPttings Difficult In addition, there will be con- ferences on the settings with the stage crew and member'S of the executive committe!>. \Winterset although it calls for· but two set.s, is one of the hardest plays to do from the backstage end, as all the scener~· must be specially con- structed. Rehearsals have already begun, with the actors reading th-e lines under the direction of Ferdinand Helm, Jr., the stage manager for the production. Meanwhile work on the remodeled green l'QOm is being pushed. Major part.;; in the production of \Winterset\ are being talten as follows•: Mio, John B.

The new magazine will combine features of plans submitted by two groups, one I1eaded by Ferdinand Helm '37 and S. -Ralph Cohen '37 and the other by Hyman A. Enzer '38, Julius Bundgus '38, Henry D. Hartman '38. It will be issued quar- terly and will contain fiction, verse, humor, editorials, photographs and other features. The staff for this year will be se- lected by the Publications Board from a Jist of qualified men lecom- mended by the Student Council. The staffs for subsequent years will be chosen by the Publicationd Boar·d in accordance with any plan it may choose. Although heads of the staff will be seniors, all mem· bers of the editorial board will have an equal voice in directing the magazine's policy. To Have Pictm·es The new magazine will be printed on gl-ossy paper and will be of the same size as the Idol, 10 by 7l.fl inches. It will contain at least 48 pages, including six pages of photo- graphs and two pages of line cuts. The cover, which will be changed each issue, will be illustrated by either a photograph or drawing. The material in the new publica- tion will be well diversified to in- eludt• fiction, serious and humorouo feature articles, poetry, verse, jokes. It will also contain regular columns covering four fields of interest: edi- lor'rals; spurts; cultur·a! activities, <uch as literature, music, drama; anti light commentary on campus news and activities. Contest for Name A contest for a name for the magazine will be conducted by the :'ltudent Council. Students are re- quested to submit titles, one of which the Council will select. The name selected will not be an- nounced until the magazine is pub- lished for the fir::;t time about the first of April. Two issues will be published this year, on April 1 and Junior Prom weekend. In subsequent years the magazine will be published quar- terly. Fifteen hundred copies will be printed of the first two Issues and an attempt will be made to raise the circulation of later issues to two thousand copies. In contrast to the policy of the Idol during the past two ~·ears the new magazine will include ad.vertising. The Student Council plans to ap- point a committee to supervise the operations of the magazine staff to insure a worthwhile publication, and to prevent cliques in the edi- torial board. ---O>--- Singers In Two Concerts In Consecutive Weeks The Union College Glee Club will have an intensive schedule for the next two weeks, with two major concerts scheduled for the succes- sive weekends. Tomorww night the club will sing at the Stil~water High School, for the benefrt of the school's music fund. One of the major events of the year in Stillwater the program will be a long one, ~ith skits and solo groups, Next Friday night they will give their annual Albany concert, spQn- sored by the Albany Alumni Asso- ciation. The concert will be held this year in the Hotel Ten Ey-ck, and the program will be substan- tially the same as that at Still• water. At both concerts, the G-arnet Goblins will play for dancing. The club has also planned abQut ten more concerts for the year, In- cluding the New York joint cmmert with Elmira College at the Wal- dorf-A:storia later this month, and another joint concert with Skid- more, this time at Saratoga,

Donneus, vvealthJ· Lt·oker. With the death of .l\Ir. Doremus' 1vid()vv the college received the estate. The moral ll~tck of thh; story is as evident as the mathematician's dilemma, the intl'i- cate formula, 2 x 2-=1. Somewhat amtlogous to this tale is the one :; mTotmding the don~t­ tion of the Godshall wdmvment. .l\h·. God- shall, a wealthy self-educated engineet·, was assochtted with a man who had hea1·d favor- able comments of Union. ~n making his will Godshall consulted this rnan .and made him an executor of it. Remembering Union as well a,s Lehigh and Rensselaer, the fact that he left us money was prompted becam;.e his friend had heard nothing but praise of us. It is under cit~cumstances such as these that one is ready to believe that an invest- ment in g-ood manners and conduct, not to mention attractive appearances, pays excel- lent dividends. Consequently Dr. Fox once appealed to the students' sense of decency from the chapel dais in a harangue on the commonplace front a student body makes which does not consider the propriety of its apparel. If it is these little things that catch the eye of visitors, we might profitably acknowledge them by th.eir practice. Per- haps we too, will find ~()ol1le Do1·emus.

This marked the sec- ond win of the season for the frosh, and indieated the poten- tial stJ ength they could save for the despetate last minute melees ... a sttength they failed to 'Show in either the fii·st or second periods. Sc>cond Pc>riod Action Although nothing ha.ppened in the first period the second saw little more action. Lene>:x came out strong, but thanks to Johnny Cone who was all over the ice a~d playing hard hockey every nunute, the score r:emained dead- locked until Lenox scored in a jam in front of the Union cage late in the period. The last pedocl saw the Fresh- men stat·t on the scol\ing spr·ee that put the game on ice, Lenox, ><till ;;kating hard, slipped the puck past Brigg:o in the opening few seconds. That. score pr·ovidl'd the spal'it that the Frosh needed. 'rhe for- ward line began to synchronizl'. The puck moved down into Lenox tenitory, and stayed there. Long shots and scort flips proved use- less however, until Gene Fink poked a goal into the net at a: little past half time. Then Schwer e, prominent LenoK wing- man, was put out in the penalty box. His absence was strangely felt, and in the interim Matiy Heck, playing his first game at center, tallied to even the score once more. In the next two min- utes Lenox was penalized again and the Freshmen repeated the ptevious score . . . Fink tallying on an assist from Johnny Cone at 12:42. Urrion successfully held the advantage until the end of tbe game and prevented a demoral- ized Lenox sextet from making any serious threats 'till the finai whis- tle.

We can- n<lt agree whole-heartedly upon the practicability of tl1e Council's synthesized proposaJ, but we are hap-py to see that many of tbe fea- tures proposed for the unpublJshed Idol have been incorporated into the new project. \We will be interested to watcl> dEvelopments, and see what ba}l- opens after it has been subjected to the merciless scrutiny of the Pub- lications Board. \Since we are directly conceMied, we realize that anything we say will, as in the past, be held against 11s. In other words, we feel that the student council is both benevo- -lent and optimistic-and a little tardy .. \ Adequate Julius J.

I refer, of course, to the Council's demand for a 2,000 circu- lation, definite number of pages of illustrative material, etc. The sta.ff will have to work on a pay-as-y-ou- \'O basis: amount of student tax, plus advertising and circulation revenue will determine size of :magazine, number of cuts used, and circulation. ••Jt would help to have the !:dol staff work regularly-as The Con- cordiensls does-in the Publication <Office,. and thereby enable the y<mnger men to leam from the dder-men.'' • New Named trnsts Trustees UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N.

And perhaps someday, if business prospers, Barbieri hopes we may see a manicurist at work in the basement of Silliman Hall. Not only does this shop on the campus save the inconvenience of going downtown for haircuts, but it also provides a prospective gath- ering place for students to congre· gate and discuss tbe general news of the day.

Vincent declared that there are thr·ee things which can be said of God. \First He is to be thought of as the sustainer of our mental life, quite as much as the creator. If there were no mind and order in the universe about us ordered thought would cease,. communica- tion between minds would be im- possible; and we would wander lilte poor idiots or creatures of blind impulse on the face of the eaxth, We are sustained in our existeace as thinking beings by the presence of the mind of God in all the universe about us.\ live tnore than a year, in spite of group here, and to have periodic all science could do. \He actually mee.tings during the year and at lived just six months,\ Dr. Leonard such th:nes necessai'Y in the in- added. teri:r:n.

Students and fraternity g:roups will again be able to re- serve se<ats for basketball games, Professor J. Harold Wittner-, director of athletics, announced today. The decision was reached by a. committee composed of Prof. Wittner, John K. Sloatman, '37, and Vincent J. Smith '38. Mr. Wittner- explained the new rul- .ing as follows: \Fraternities and other groups reserving seats were asked to reconsider the number of seats they need- ed, and as a result, sixty-eight less se.ats were requested in spite of the fact that two groups as.:ked for a larger num- ber of seats than their former quota required. This reduction makes poss.ible the return to the old sys-tem and blocks of seats will again be reserved for the next game.\ The action was taken as a re- sult of expressions of dissatis- faction ·on the campus follow- ing the d·ecision of the athletic departrne·nt to discontinue the practic-e of issuing reserved seats f~r basketball games. Secondly, he asserted., \God is a unifying and inclusive life. We are in God somewhat as the> crew mem- ber is in the· crew, the singer in the choir, the branch in the vine, the member in the body. \God is the inclusive lift. But with such a life it is easy and natural to be happy and rec<>n- ciled.\ Rev. Vincent continued: \The third thing we can say is that God is, on the whole, probably best described by the word 'father'. When, now, we put together these various facts, we may indeed feel that the life behind this world is no 'father' in the small-boy con- ception of a father. But in a far deeper and grander sense we can look out and up as Jesus did, and call God 'Our Father'. We can be 'reconciled' to God.\ lege students planning to adopt about to die with a cancer of the governm.ent service as a career , Tlie principal speaker of the eve- with -the doings and functions of testes. !n ing v;as George 0.

This apparent injustice brought a widespread howl of protest from those impli- cated as well as those not. It was argued that tickets were being sold twice, once to the students through the student tax and a second time to paying spectators. Or some said the college is failing to meet all its obli- gations to the students, for on their athletic card it states that a re~e1·ved seat ca11 l.Je had at Hll home contests upon presentation of the card. In any case whatever the arguments we1·e they implied that a serious injustice was being perpetrated against the students. Not once did the students stop to consider that perhaps they might have been in el\l'or. Few paused before cl'iticizing to think that if every person, \Vho was entitled to a re- sel·ved seat before. they were put on sale to · the general public, received one the gymnas- ium would scarcely accommodate the crowd. FUithermore a great many of the spectators are alumni anyhow, cwd they have as much right as the students have for tickets, at least one finds this true if one recalls that private colleges such as ours survive only so long as theh· alumni wish it. Now how with all these people wanting or deserving seats is the athletic department going to satisfy the demands put on it? Its members have chosen one of the few courses of solution to the problem available to it, and are trying to economize on the disposal of the tickets so that everyone interested in the games can.

THAT MAGAZINE -- The Stu- dent Council has gotten around to the magazine problem, but it isn't settled yet, by any means. Their project still has to undergo a fine- tooth-combing by the Publication Board. There has been a lot of buck- passing about the Idol, and no one is too anxious to take any responsibility fat' the mess. The n,ASS ENDOWMENTS story of tl::e pre-abolition occur- ences has been rendered in several different ver8ions, but when it came out in the open, the Board put ilself into a strange position. They implied, by 1 ecornmending that the Council abolish the Idol, :'\ot so long ago we endorsed a plan for that the power· uve1· publications . . rested with that body, which is rarsmg a class endowment fund. In between emphatically not so. The Idol was the time of om· original announ\elnei1t and authorized In the first place by v the Board, and was always under the present we have had the opportunity of its supervision. The Council's new project is raising- the funds. As yet we have come to really a condensation of the two plans proposed by the old Idol no conclusion as to the best, but we hope in board and the Hartmann-Bundgus- 1 E:nzer combine, but plus severq.l t 1e neal' future to present at ]east the found- Council ideas.

The final say on in one form or another. \\'e reprint a story the whole affair rests ·with Dean Garis, who says little for publica· from the New York Times relative to this tion, but who carries weigrt in private deliberations, and the subject in the hope that it will throw new. P1·esident's representative on the · f Board, who is theoretically a :;ort ll1 ormation on college endo\Yments at other of technical adviser. institutions. The story follows: In a way, the chaotic state of student government and its various constitutions b responsible for the Plnns for '<'ni<d cla,<s life insura.nce, making Williams College sole beneficiary of a $20,000 fund at the end of twenty-five years await only approval of the Undergraduate Council. Originated by the class O·f '14, the idea consists buying $200 poliries on membms of the class. The college i.s the beneficiary when the policy matures. Richard W. Colman, JI., pt esident of the clas\ of '37, recommended the action duplicating that undertaken by last yea1\s seniors in accordance with the wishes of President Emeritus Harry A. Garfield, at whose suggestion the plan was orig- inated at Williams two decades ago. It was Mr. Garfield's thought that were the plan adopted by successive classes it might be put on a perma- nent basis and accumulate a la1ge college endow- ment similar to that which has given Princeton University a working fund of nearly $2,000,000. Student approval was foreshadowed in the edi- torial columns of The Williams Record, under· graduate bi-weekly, which heralded the scheme as \the best way in which the class of 1937 could pay some of the vast debt which they owe· to the college.\ . fact that there has been no maga- zine issued this yeai. It is possible, because no one knows exactly where ~ny responsibility lies, to tie up any unwelcome movement in enough red tape to last until the movers are out of college. There may be a little of this in the Idol episode. THE COUNCIL-President Rob- . • ert Everest pt'obably did his best in appointing the committee on the magazine. Typical of the ques- . tions asked by the committee <two . athletes and one sports writer) was: \Why have editoriais in the maga~ zine? Don't the Concord! have . enough of them?\ . FREE P:RESS-The press, or what passes for it, at Union hras . been singularly free from any cen- sorship. The faculty-student Publi- cations Board bothers usually with . little but the elections of editors, and they have elected some that they knew beforehand might turn out to be tartars. Despite their inevitable reputation for tyranny, however, they are outdone in con- seivatism, by the Student CouncH, which is making a valiant effort to cant rol all articulate student opinion. They failed to saddle The Concordiensis with a \board of control,\ and they are now trying to save the magazine from the for- mation of \cliques.\ It is all very much like appointing a committee of students to l{eep football play- ers from going out for the foot- ball team.

Tt:e late Irving Thalberg, the actual producer of the film, was the man responsible for the high quality of Romeo and Juliet as much as any one person can be in the intricate IJusiness of synthe- sizing a motion picture. It was he that pici{ed the actors and techni- cians, selecting thern fol' their ex- pertness and good taste, and set the line which they followed. As a result of this intelligent se- lection and coordin:.ation we have a Romeo and Juliet in which each detail shows the care expended upon it.

This acting on the part of each person in the cast has ct·ystal clarity achieved In part by the work of Jennings in. paring and arr ang:ing the play for intelligibil- ity, omitting superfluous material, providing for visual narrative, and in part by the excellence in read- ing tbe lines, giving them their proper weight, never playing a false or overheightened emotion. Not to drive to fine a point, Romeo and Juliet is played for what it is, what it's worth. Avoid- ing by a close margin the stilted- ne::;:; that comes from too much- care; it proceeds reasonably through its scenes to the climax, the quality never falters.

State Supreme Court Taken To Task PRrrCE FIVE CENTS Dean ~Garis Issues Statement to Clear Reports About Idol New Magaz.ine or Any Activ- ity Must lle Approved By Administration Fox:. 't() Decide If Appt·ove<l; New Magazine Will Be Esta:blished by the Publications Board Dean Chal·l<=> 'F. F. Garis today issued the following statement con- cet ning the ·e::;tablishment of a new college magazine to replace the Idol: \So many sta.tements concerning The Idol have appeared in The Concordiensis which are not found- ed un fact U1at I feel it my duty as Pre::>ident .of the Publications Board and Dean of the College to attempt to clal'ify this situation. \Any aetivi ty supported by st\1- dent tax must originate with the Student Body, at present through the Student Council. A request for this activity rnust then be made to the Administration of the College. If approved b:y the Administration, it will be assigned to an already constituted body to see that it is put into operation, or a new agency will be set UJ>. If it is not approved the activity '\ill not exist. The principle that the group paying the bill should decide what it wants and try to get it is a correct one. Admlnlstr~tlon Approval \The Idol was established in ex- actly this way. At the time we had no Studl'nt Co·uncil and no Tax Committee. A group of students asked the Student Body in meet- ing to vote a tax for The Idol. It was voted. 'rhis vote constituted a request on the part of the Student Body for a n<'w publication. The Administration approved the re- quest on the part of the Student Body for a new publication. The A.dministratlon approved the re- quest and the publication of The Idol became the duty of the Publi- catio.ns Boa1·d. This board added to its by-laws ways and means f()r electing edit<>rs and managers and for printing the magazine. The magazine a.ppea.red and the process was complete. \When it conus to abolishing an activity which continues to have the approval of the Administration, anyo.ne connected with the college may suggest to the Student Coun- cil that the .activity has lived its life of useft1lness and had better be buri<'d. The Student Council may or may 11ot vote to abolish ·it. Had the Student Council not voted to abolish The Idol it would still be the duty of the Publications Board to continue its publication. The Board allj such cannot origi- nate or abolish publications. It may recommend ot· nquest the Student Council to do certain things in the same way that any student or member of tile faculty may re- quest thPm. It might even ask the Administration to withdraw its ap- proval. This also might b!' done by any individual. \The Student Council has. asked for a new m11gazine. The request for its a.pp1:oval' came to me and it was turned over to the President of the College. The Publications Board has no authority to consider this request. The President will consult with whom he chooses and render a decision. If he approves, the Publications Board will again set up means for publishing the magazine as approved.

Illinois, next week to speak at the centenal'y of Knox Coll.ege he \Vill L~ bearing testimon.Y to the value of the small college, and to the axiom that no college knows what it is doing whe·n it ;,;tarb <I young man o.u the pursuit of learning. For it was from Union that George Wash- ington Gale went to the \first })rairie col- lege\ in 1837 with a colony ft·om New York State which took up land on the frontier with the deliberate intention, 11ot of making money, but of establishing \The Knox Man- ual Labor C()llege,\ the earliest American at- tempt to combine work with \a thorough system of mental, moral and physical educa- tion,\ as the first prospectus of Knox College stated. It is interesting to note how the i11flue11ce of Union College pervaded the enterprise which the Reverend George Washing-ton Gale, then pastor of the Presbyterian GhuTch at Whitesbol'O, conceived to be the g·reat need of the new frontier; for as Union, in 1795, on the then frontier, believed the times called for a strong institution which sho-uld be free from denominational control but should be hospitable to all religious beliefs, so did this son of Union-hom at a time so near to the beg-inning-s of the nation that his parents named him George Washington-be- lieve that the new West needed the sm·t of education that Union had given him. Taking up eleven thousand acres of the \military tract\ in Illinois set aside for sol- diers of the War of 1812 and which the sol- diers declined to accept, the settlers of Gales- burg· sold off land for enough money to launch the college which they had gone west to found. The organization had been per- fected at Rome in 1835 .. The migration be- gan in 1836, and by the .end of 1837 the col- ony numbered 232 men, women and ehildren. · ... THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1937 WHAT IS THE MAGAZINE? The controversy ovet· the defunct Idol re- curs again and again at the least mention of a college literary 111agazine, and this is fre- quent. The Publications Board, or at least some of its individual membe1·s, has repeat- edly been approached in an effort to com- pr0mise the disap·eement between the sev- eral pm·ties interested in regenerating soml sort of a periodical, but unfortunately it does not lay within the jurisdiction of this board to co11sider or determine the natm·e of a nev. publication, and f()r that reason the ultimate determinator is the administration. F\tu-theemore the Student Council must appl'ove of any plan for a new pu hlication be- fore it goes to th€ administnttion. In lig-ht of its recent actio11 on the several proposal~ for mag-azines we can readily see the inad- visa.bility of going· thl'Ough all these formal- ities in order to S<tnction the cre~ttion of any publication. ln the first place any plan which is \put through the mill\ as this one was in its pee- limiuarr con.sidera.tion and in which the re- ~ult comes to s UC!·h an unsatisfHctory com- pr0rnise will neve1· sustain the interest of its creat(}l'S. And ill.S(}far as this interest is necessary to the livelihood and vitality of any o1·ganization we express concern that the plan as it is lll-esented to the administra- tion has really onls the backing- of the Stu- .:lent Coundl. If it wants to take over the .'unction of editin&- a magazine in additi<ln to .ts already nmnenHIS tasks, all well and good, but whoever is to undertake the control of this enterpris.e must enter it with a whole heai\t not tainted with dissatisfaction, and unstinted entliusiasm. A Student MUSIC By HERBER'f 0. FOX The third in the series of musical offerings by the Civic Music Asso- ciation was heard last night when · Arthur Rodzinski conducted the • Cleveland orchestra in a symphonic program. The Cleveland Symphony repre- ~ent.:; the achieved aspimtion of any number of stluggling Civic Sym- phonies. They look to the infancy of that organization, compare its progress with their own effort and call a rehearsal to blow and stwke with new vitality. 'The organization typifies the position that an or- ~hestra can hold in a community. More than an occasion for an en- joyable concert in Schenectady it should be a stimulant to the musi~ cal morale of a community appar- ently disinterested in the potential'- ity of its own symphony; one no more home-spun in character than the original Cleveland 01 chestra. In last night's performance there was nothing to suggest of amateur- ish musicianship; nothing to hint at the humble beginning of a group now recognized as accomplished. The prog1am selection in itseJ.f was singular; it did no-t condescend. In ,;kill of performance Mr. Rodzinski 1Continued on Page 4) CINEMA By JOHN B.

Never once dr\awing its punches, Black Legion draws its entertain- ment power from being a straight- forwar\d dramatic st<Jry told with no lost motion.

The score, 1 to 0, was tallied in the early minutes of the opening period by Wilcox of the Continental defense. Throughout the whole game both teams had frequent chances to put the puck past the goal tenders, but with AI Borden, making 42 saves, and Laux, stop- ping 41 shots, in top form the first period goal was the only tally of the game. Despite the fact that Hamilton scored a goal in the first period neither team showed superiority over the other. The blue shirted hocl{eyists often outskated the hard pressing opponents, but the visitors with good stick handling managed to keep the puck in their possession much of the time. Outstanding on the Continental team wet·e Pooley and Mater ne, both excellent skat- ers, while Borden, if an individual were to be selected as a star, ex- hibited the best performance of the Union team.

It included important recommenda- tions on the subject of personnel, callin~ fot a V<:ty ;:teat extentiion of the met it ::;ystem in Civil Service so that the majority, about 90 per cent, of frderal office holders would be included. It wa,; also sug- gested that the Civil Service Com- mission setup be changed, so that eventually a ::;Ingle person may 1 e- place the co!lltnission. In view of thi,;, Dr. PattPrson H. French, associate professor of gov- ernmPnt at Union College, and po- tential facultv adviser of the Union chaptet:, pointed out that Civil Service is bound to be a sub- ject of lengthy inter est and cont 1 u- versy in the en:;uizq; years.

MUSIC (Continued fl·om Page 2) reached top level early in the pl a- gram, in ffa!Idl\l's \The Water Music.\ The work actually has a liquid character. It reaches a spir- itual level, predominates in devo- tional theme. 1 etuz ns more than occru;ionally to an intricacy in struc- tme, to remind that after all this whole business of musical interpre- tation is essentially technical, re- gardlesl:l of emotional connota;tion. Tlw fit~>t movement of the D Minot Sympohny held promise. The! e was vitality in the announce- ment of the motifs which appem thJOughout the Ce:;ar Franck com- position. The following movements moved in resignation, without pulse. In the Prelude and Love Death from \Tristan und Isolde\ we gather the entire temper of that opera. Contained in the Prelude alone are the chief themes woven throughout the Wagner work, cul- minating in the ardently passionate \LiPb~tod\ of Isolde. The f'Uite from Igor Stravinsky's \The Fire-Bird\ is an impish creation. Strange har- mony--if it is that-finds release from familiar instruments. The wicked Ga.stchei himself bewitches the score and produces a weird in- ferno of sound. Mr. Rodz.jnski failed to 1 eturn to the original spitit of the Handel work throughout the course of the evening. Perhaps it was that early drone or the frequent ja1 ring of countless doors, competing train whistles, or lhat gap between artist and audience which 1 emained un- filled.

There was no decision. Thursday the debating team goes to Swarthmore where the question will be: Hesotved that the presi- dent's plan for reforming the Su- preme Court be adopted. Union has the negative. This debate wilt be broadcast. Friday afternoon the debaters stop off at H.utgers where they ar'l debating the question: Resolved that Congress should be empowered to fix minimum wages and maxi- mum hours for industry.

F<'ht·uar)\ 16, 1937 OUR BENEFA.C\l'OR Some men find a grea.t interest in watch- ing others enjoy pleasures which they them- selves enjoy. Not long· .:clgo an enthusiastic collector of' John Howard Payne's works read in the newspape1·s that Union College was exhibiting a few manuscripts, and first and rare editions of Payne's plays. Although he had neve1· been associated with the college in any way nor with DI·. F()x, he loaned us several important edition~:. for the exhibit. And a s.hort while late1· doaated sev€ral mm·e copies of Payne material for the library to add to its shelves of l'~ll'e and valuable edi- tions. His first offer was of a copy of a painting supposedly of Payne in middle ag-e. This was a photogTaph. Apparently n()t satisfied with this gift he had an oil C()py made for the college, which no\v hangs in the l\Iounte- banb Theatre. And, as though he would never be satisfied untiJ he had brought Payne himself back, the other day he sent in the ol'ig;inal of this painting. done by c. n. King-, a \loan\ which will grace the walls of some hall about here for a long time. Another painting- that he gave to the col- lege waE'! the beautiful landscape by Joseph Jefferson which is hung in Silliman Hall. ..• THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1937 TO OUR HAlVIILTON FRlEND.S The passing ·of Blihu Root was of mor·e than passing- concern to us.

He con- tributed his all mentally and physicaHy to establish the prestige of Hamilton firmly • whe1~ever he could. His love for the college can best be exem- plified in the fact that he kept a residence open among the hills immediately adjacent to the college grounds, and now that he breathes no longer his fixed gaze is towards the grassy quads and stone buildings wnich · he held close to his heart, for his body lies intened in the college plot. We can sympathize with our brother col- leg·e for its keenly felt loss. But when a great man such as Mr. Root leaves, his phys- ical departure is scarcely felt. His lnagnan- imous nature and sterling character are a spirit of the man that transcends mm-tal time. It will pervade the college much as om· own Dr. Nott's has as long· as their students in the hulls. 'TABLES TO SIT AT We They We They We They When the well-informed individ- ual: is interrogated regarding the Spanish Civil War, he knows the whole historical background; he can tell you about not one five-year plan, but two in the Soviet Union; ·he realizes that there is, a struggle ~between Fascism and liberalism in Japan; and he knows when and · ·whe1·e the next war w'ill begin. But how about more fundamental ques- tions such as what kind of food do :people in other na:tions eat? Do they have s3.fe and comfortable houses .to ·dwell in? Do they 'have proper nutrition for their young people? ·Do they have leisure time to enrich their lives? Do they have freedom? Do they have enough modern con- >\eniences to ·keep life from being mere drudgery? Do their wages permit them sufficient consumption ·goods to live .healthy? In our aca- demic interests we are too often likely to forget that these countries we discuss are more than diploma- tic personalities, they are made up of milhons of humans whose earth- ly existence depends on the answer to the a:bove questions. Perhaps if we took the trouble to find out those answers, we would have a better understanding and apprecia- .tion of our pr·oblems a..nd theins. While American news is full of courts and strikes, Europe enjoys a rest from diplomatic strain. This is not a turning point, hut a lull, and the nations take advantage of it to build up their defenses. Ma- drid seems to be holding, Germany shows signs of talking, ·Czecho- slovakia prospers in trang,uility, and ·Edward's pension is becoming a na- tional crisis in England: A great number of students, since Hale House was g-iven to the college, have found it pleasurable to eat their Sunday evening meals in the Dining· Hall. They have reserved what criticisms, of food, cost, service and everything- else that is genemlly criticized in a commissary, they hav.e made with thDught- ful consideration. But recently a particular grievance became so rife that they could no longer contain their vitriol within them- selves, and many of them have voiced their indignation with us. -------------- .of the Institute of the Theatre, is CINEMA Certain persons, often not associated with the college, have begun the practice of t·e- serving tables for Sunday suppet·. Th.ey in- form 1\Irs. Bt·igg·s that they wish a table for four and it is theirs. Unfortunately the easiest tables to reserve for this number are the small round ones, which the students like best, and they have resented the fact that the use of these tables is being withdrawn f1·om them. And this attitude seems justifi- able when we consider that after all the din- ing- hall is suppo-sed to be a convenience to the students and faculty. NQ one else should have precedence over them. Why, the ad- ministration even forces some .students to eat their meals there. Surely they should be given the \nod\ when they ask for seats. Since the whole dining room is seldom completely filled at once, if tables are to be reserved, those larg·e ones at the west end of the hall might be the best ones to set aside for g·uests. The students do not sit there regularly anyhow and the p.ersons who want tables reserved will find these quite exclu- sive of students and comfortable. What little difference a chang-e of this sort would make with ou1· g-uests would mean a g-reat deal to the undergraduates. With this fact in mind we urge and recommend this departure from the former policy. At Other Colleges ... Charles Seymour, provo.st and history professor at YALE UNIVERSITY, was elected president of Yale Saturday. Seymour, a graduate of Yale, succeeds Dr. James Rowland Angell in June. Under the auspices of the Penn State Christian Association, faculty members &nd townspeople will addres:o student groups at a series of \fireside ses- swns\ in student living centers at the PENNSYL- VANIA STATE COLLEGE. At HAMILTON, sixty-three students are get- ting unlimited cuts for the second semester for ex- cellence in scholaJship in the first semester. The students at the UNIVERSITY of LOUIS- VILLE had a two weeks vacation because of the flood. Little damage was done to the buildings, but many of the students will be unable to return if the increased allocation of National Youth Administra- tion funds, which the college expects to use, is not granted. RUMOR HAS IT CODEX CONDORDIAE-What the student body really needs, if it wants to make something of self- government, is a codification of the powers of all accredited governing bodies. Copies of their in the min- utes for December, 1905 or there- abouts, should be exhumed and shown about. Dean Garis made the first step last Friday, when he clarified the rules which govern publications. It is significant that had he done so five months ago, the1e might still be a..n Idol published this year. Another example. of the •~haos that is the distinguishing mark of student self-rule is the fate of Rob- ert Everest's N. S. F. A recom· mendations. Only two of the six points outlined a month and a half ago have been acted upon, and there are still gripes about them in cer- tain quarters. Frosh rules are not yet comfortable -in their grave, and the board of control, defeated for The Concordiensis, has been car- ried .over to the magazine question. One of the most important parts of the program, action on frater- nity rushing and Hell Week, has not been treated at an, tabled be- cause, Everest said, the :Student Council has no authority over the fraternities. What Everest did not know, probably because no one ever took the trouble to blazon forth the fact, is that the Student Council has very much to say about fra- ternity affairs. When it first came into being, it replaced not only the Terrace Council, but also an Inter- fraternHy Council. As a result, the Council has authority over the local chapters. Functional representation, the meet ballyhooed part 0f the pro- gram, still hangs fire, This sort of situation will con- tinue to crop up until a codex of rules is made. Until then, nothing will be accomplished. R H I PRACTICAL POLITICS -- Dr. Fox's emphasis upon the practical side of government has evidently had its repercussions among the trustees. John Vanneck., the young- est trustee, is a member of the finance committee of Tammany Hall. R H I CLINICAL REPORT - This .expected to become !ncr easingly so, Dr. Fox's idea of an Alumni College in the summer will probably include the wives of alumni. It may be ·in- tegrated with other college hobbie.s by having its sessions during the Festival, thereby boosting gate re- ceipts for the latter enterprise. If so. a new baby-minding service will be installed to let mamma and papa Alumnus go to the theatre. R H I SCHOLARLY COOLNESS - The. Administration wants the faculty to do research. Evidently it doesn't want them do it on Sundays. Cer- tain departments received word this month that if they wished heat on Sundays they'd have to pay .it out of their own budgets. The right and left hands of the administration should meet each other some time. R H I By JOHN B.

Because of the conflict of dates between the originally scheduled Block U Dinner on March 16 and Interfraternity Week-End when in- itiations and the Boxing and Wrest- ling Tournaments will take place, the date had to be moved forward to the 22nd. ,Coach Snavely, already scheduled for a speaking engagement on the night of March 22, wrote to Frank B. Gatchell '37, chairman of the Speakers' Committee, that he would not be able to be present at Union on that date. Negotiations have already begun, with George Daley '92 of the New York Herald Tribune as· the prin- cipal mediator, and a substitute of equal athletic fame as Snavely has been almost definitely secured. His name will be announced over the 1veekend by the speakers' commit- tee. Dave Miller '38, announced the other speakers on the program for M:onday-, March 22. President Dixon R..yan Fox will be one of the princi- pals with Robert D. Everest '37, president of the student body, and Professor J. Harold w:lttner also at the speakers' table. The toastmaster will be Nelson W. Nitchman, popu- lar head coach of football and bas- ketball. 'Sports editor Daley has not yet signified whether he will be able to attend the dinner which he start- ed in the spring of 1928 to award officially all letter-winning athle- tics of the past year. Among the notables who have been at Block U dinners are Knute Rockne, Nat Holman, Fritz Crisler, Andy Kerr, and Lou Little. ---,0--- John F. Boyc(l '38 Dies Of Pneumonia This Morning John F. Boyce '39 of Schenectady died early this morning at the Ellis Hospital following a sudden attack .of pneumonia. He was stricken Wednesday night and removed im- mediately to the hospital, although there had been no indication that he was ill before that time. A popular student in Draper High School from whence he was g~·aduated, Boyce was well liked by his fellow students here. He was affiliated with the Theta Nu Epsi- lon fraternity and was a member of the varsity swimming team this winter. Wednesday, Feb. 17.-Any slight doubts that Union men might have had about social regulations at Skidmore were clarified by lv.'Iiss Doris Lehman, president of the student body of that institution in a chapel ad- dress this morning. Miss Leh- man traced the development of the regulations from the stringent \l>ustle\ era to the present day. In 1916, for example, the fair Skidmore was cautioned to have nothing in her room \which she did not know to be useful or believe to be beauti- ful!\ In 1925 it seems that Skid- more student.s were allowed to go to the fir-st performance of a movie 1vith a gentleman friend, with no chaperone to drag ancb.or If the gentleman were approved by the Dean. The rise of smoking from a surr-eptitious cemetery pastime to a countenanced recreation was anotb.er topic. .At first, in the roseate past, circa 1927, the college fathers were wont to frown upon the vile habit, and several fair damsels had their relations with Skidmore rather abruptly broken as a conse- quence of being apprehended in the perpetration of the nefar- ious puff. The third of a series of Cape- hart recitals will take place in Memorial Chapel at 2;30 on Tues- day. The program will consist of symphonies from such classical favorites as Beethoven, Greig and Mendelssohn. These recitals which were given regularly last year, were initiated again two weeks ago, and it is planned to present a recital weekly for the remainder of the college year on Tuesday afternoons. The Capehart is a precision re- cording instrument particularly noted for the volume and clarity of its tone. It has an automatic record - changing device which makes it possible for the machine to present an entire symphony without human aid or interruptions of any sort. Union's Capehart was the gift of the Carnegie Foundation, and was presented to the college last spring. The recitals will be in charge of Fred .Alexander '37, who will en- tertain any requests for selections. There will be no admission charge, and everyone is invited to attend. Tuesday's program will be as fol- lows: Symphony in C Minor ... Beethoven Enigma Variations ......... Elgar Concerto in .A Minor ......... Greig Midsummer Night's Dream .... . . .. . . . . . . . . .. .. . . . . . Mendelssohn 'Dear Elmer'By ... WordofShort ·wave As Br()adcasts Grow in Popularity ~·----------------------------- \Dear Dr. 'I'idrnarsh: I feel that I must write to tell you how much I enjoy your program. The variety and quality of your program and your superb playing are going to be much enjoyed, I am sure. There is something about the programs that appeals. I arn not sure just what it is unless it is the fact that you make the Informal commenta- tions that injects a living person· allty into it. I have beard good organ programs before but they lacked the vitality and character of yours.\ Letters of this tYIJe from all over the United S·tates and from for- eign counti,ies sent bo·th to Dr. Tid, marsh and · to radio stations W2XAF and W2XAJJ are regis- tering the appreciation of short wave listeners for Dr. Elmer A. Tidma:rsh's weekly Saturday after- noon program ltnown over the air as the \Chapel Organ.\ The intro- duction, which is part of one re- ceived from a Mr. Evans in Kit- tery Point, w.Iaine, is only an ex- ample of .many !Ike it. Many people want to know all about the chapel and the organ which they say sounds so beautiful and clear even on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Even col- lectors of autographed photo- graphs have requested pictures of Dr. Tidmarslt at his organ. Following requests of the short wave announcers for reports on the quality of reception, many lis- ·teners have written. in, claiming perfect reception in many places for Dr. Tidmarsh's program, even in England, Ireland, and on ship- board off the coast of Norway. A Mr. Bird in Oklahoma writes for his invalid mother, that he wishes ta personally thank Mr. Tidmarsh for his \splendid\ pro- gram, stating that she looks for- ward from week to weelt for the feature. A Miss Betty Brown of radio station CJCB, Sydney, Nova Scotia wrote long praising criti- cisms of the program. She and sev- eral others who commented en- thusiastically on the programs ex:- plained that they felt qualified for writing by vir.tue of their training in conservatories of music and in study of the organ. One writer from London, Eng- land, states that he and his friends believe that stations W2X.AF and W2XAD are the loudest of ally American stations received in Eng- land. The stated willingness of Dr. Tid- farsh to play requested numbers has brought repeated requests especially for Bach's \The Air for the G String,\ which apparently has made a hit with many people.

AI Van Wert HONORARY FELLOW FIN- EGAJS' and his Saturday morning show were extremely distasteful. Mr. Finegan's. remarks were, to put it mildly, in extremely bad taste. So bad, in fact, that many of those present were embarrassed. It is hoped that in Mr. Finegan's future visits to the campus he will display more tact. The purpt>se of this sche·d• ule is, as I understand it, to pre- vent a student's. having to take more than one l!our ex:amination in a single day. When one takes into consideration the amount of studying neces~ary for an ex:ami- nation the reason for this restric- tion is obvious. Friday, February 19, 1937 WHERE'S 'l'HE INFIRMARY? Through much good fortune and pet·haps a little care th.ere ha.ve been no deaths in the undergraduate body at Union College during the past year. But if a student in residence on the campus OJ' even in a hoarding hou~P off campus sh()uJd die of natural causes, say of complications arising from an attack of the grippe, U 11ion College would be visited with a disaster that would be entirely unwel- come but perha!)s not unexpected. Without adequate provision for the nurs- ing of students who are suddenly afflicted with illness, Union College has left on.e very important student service off its long list of activities in the past year. There is still an imperative need fo1· an infirmar;y. If cog- nizance is not taken of this need shortly. the college may ,be rather severely jolted some wet, spring morning to find one of its stu- dents dead because of an attack of the flu which was ne\T€1~ attended by a doctot·. There are many cases which are n()t seri- ous enough f<Jr hospital care, but when a flu- ridden student needs three days of rest in bed with attention at least three times a day, there ought to be some provision made at the college he attends-200 or 400 miles from home-to see that he gets well and two col- lege doctors Wh<> handle numerous germ- filled invalids in their own office cannot see every sick m~m on the campus. If Union College intends to give its stu- dents the best of everything there is one fundamenta:l situation to start with.

When a student's hair . caught on fire, he put out the flame slamming a book on the fellow's head. 118 S. FERRY ST. SCHENECTADY, N. U.S. Senator Gerald P. Nye says ~l enjoy the comfort a light smoke gives my throaf ln a recent independent survey, an over- whelming majority of la\vycrs, doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc., who said they smoked cigarettes, ex- pressed their personal preference for a light smoke. Senator Nye's statement verifies the wisdom of this preference and so do leading artists of radio, stage, screen and opera, whose voices are their fortunes, and vrho choose Luckies, a light smoke. You, too, can have the throat protection of Luckies-a light smoke, free of certain harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process ~tit's Toasted\. Luckies are gentle on your throat. Hfhat•e smol<ed Luckies off and on ever since lll)' first term in the Senate 11 years ago, and I hm;e always enjoyed their taste and the feeling of comfot't and safety a light smoke gives my throat. I ha'l'e done a great deal of public speak- ing, on the floor of the Senate, over the radio and at conferences. Necessarily this results in a strain on the voice. So naturally, in smoking, I have to think of my throat-and I have found that a light smol<e is suitable to my throat.\ HON. GERALD P. NYE U. S.

The These Professors Pl'Ofessor at Bay, by Burges Johnson, 243 pp. New York; G. P. Putna.m's Sons, $~. T.he-se professors, one hears N: said, live cloistered lives out of touch with their fellows a~d every- day reality-well, one of them stands at bay now to present a .to- tally different picture. In a book of essays which az·e wise and witty and erni~ently . sensible, Burges Johnson, JOUrnalist, author, editor and for twenty years a. college pro- fessor, expresses a philosophy which is anything but remote. \Whatever grains of wisdom I may ever gain must come from conta.cts with my kind,\ Dr. John- son says. And forthwith he launches upon the commentary, nearly always both humorous and philosophic, which makes up his book. The first part of the book is distinctly humorous., for all its thoughtfulness oand common sense. The reader will chuckle happily over this professor's fondness for ·ilrgum~nt and disdain of axion his willingness to take the teacher's oath if parents and lawyers and Senators and others will make cer- tain vows of loyalty arul obedience, toD; his reactions to the \new cuss\ words\ culled from psychology and political economy, his opinion of statistics. The good humor will lin- ger; and solid l'eflection will lin- ger too. In sorn~ of the essays toward the end of the book Dr. Joh.nson gives a less smiling-though always ur- bane-consideration to some of the major problems !>f education, such as the demand for practical \re- sults,\ the students' own attitude toward learning as lea.r.ning and the competitic>n which he calls \campus against classroom.\ There are thirty papex·s in this colume and they range over a variety of subjects. The ge:neral reader will fin.d the book as a whole both en- joyable and stimulating. -The New York Times.

Basically, the r{;aga- zine as it will appear, will be the same thing that the old board wanted to put out in the first place, To make a slight variation on this theme, it would seem that someone has been responsible for hol<iing up the whole project for about four months, with practically no results. Someone's face must be red, but as usual, it is probably red only in private. One good step in the opening of ~he determination of editorial pol- tcy to more men on the sPn ior board-a system which will ensure greater cooperation among the members, and which might well be extended to other publications. . Dr. Johil:l!on, who extremely dis- liked the mformality of the old b()ard's business sessions, entered a pet plan into the project with the rule that the hoard must meet regularly and that the individual members must be there. Another new idea is the election of a junior to the post of business manager, presumably because \seniors won't work.\ However, there are still those who were prominent in the work for a new magazine who have not been recognized by posts on the board. Ineligibility may stand in the way of a few of these men, but they can be valuable as members, and r~tber troublesome oil the out- side.

'l.'he game, a rough-and-tumble af-· fair, gave early promise of being close throughout as neither team managed to build up a sub-stantial lead until the Garnet ·finally con- centrated its attack and finished ahead 40-28, The first half scoring was dom- inated by Lou Kozlevcar of Union, whose consistant shooting kept the hometeam a:t a par with the Tro- jans. He, however, left the game via the personal foul route soon after the intet'mission, and the lead see-sawed ·baclc and forth until the fourth quarter, when the· Garnet yearlings began to function smooth- ly for the first timeand commenced to build up the lead. All of the play- ers of each team saw action, with Miller and Kozlevcar rating special credit. The former garnered a total of seven points, the latter, twelve. The game was the concluding one on the frosh schedule, leaving them with four :wins and two losses as their record.

Season Concluded By Hockey Sextet Hawley, Paul, Orton Are Outstanding for Dutchmen Thwarted at almost every turn by old man weather and his balmy days, the varsity hockey team had a great deal of difficulty in prac- ticing and evPn playing many of their matches, an<.! yet mana.ged to surv.ive ·the season without too dis- appointing a showing. Undct· the guiding hand of \Duke\ Nelson, who made his deout as hockey co_ach this year, the sextet did most of its practicing on the board track and on the blackboard, hung up its skates be-tween games, yet rounded out the season with as successful a r•ecord as· a hockey team has 'boast- lid here in z·eeent yPars ... one win and four losses. each by a one point margin. Due to the freakish weather, the team had little opportunity of pt ac- ticing together as a unit, and over the span of the winter, did not re- ceive one full week of good ice. Even on the days when suitable ice was available, it was shared with the freshman squad. But one game was played on the home rink, four wel'e contested on foreign ice, and three were cancelled altogether. Hawley, Paul, Orton Paul, Orton, Hawley and Borden were the mainstays of the team, although Breymaier, Bond and Thompson showed flashes of form which might have produced a win- ning team if there had been more chance for practice. Paul, Orton and Hawley were the backbone of the attael{ in the first game which Mass. State took, 3-2 at Amherst. The Williams fray, nex:t on the pro- gram, was cancelled, and then Middlebury was extended to an overtime period to win 5-4 as Joe Paul flicked the nets for the tying score in the last period. Cornell was postponed, Army won 4-3, and then Union took its lone victory over M. I. T. as Paul and Hawley combined to force the issue most of the game. A game with Colgate was postponed, Hamilton took its usual victory, ibut by a close score, 1 to 0, and the final match with R. P. I. was cancelled. The post- poned game with Colgate, sched- uled again for Feb. 11 was once more put off indefinitely. Coach Nelson expressed himself as satisfied with the performances of the team, for any of the games might have gone either way, so un- certain was the outcome. The team is now familiar with the Nelson methods, and in another year should hit a peak hitherto unat- tained by a Union hockey squad.

U.n- der his able tutelage fencing has becC>me an intercollegiate sport at Union. The climax of his coaching was a victory over the supposedly in- vincible Hamiltonians. This is the first time that a Union fencing team has beaten Hamilton. When the last sabre event was conclud- Pd, Union was the winner by a score of 14 to 13. Captain James Righter was the outstanding fen- cer of the day, taking fout' con- tests, two in the foils and two in the sabre. Kent Dewey was sec- ond with victories in three con- tests and a tie in a fomth. Sheldon )f Union and de Lalla, who was high for Hamilton, ti('d with three victor·ies apiece. Righter StaJ'S One of the highlights of the match was Righter's second vic- tory in the foils where he had three points scored against him and then took five consecutive points to win. As in the M. I. T. meet Union showed her superiority in the sabre by winning six: out of a possible nine bouts. Three of these proved to be the winning margin. Five bouts were taken in the foils to fout· for Hamilton, atld on.Jy two were taken in the epee. Summaries: Foil-Righter (U) defeated Scott, 5-4; Sheldon (U) defeated Cantor, 5-3; de Lalla.

BASEBALL IN THE AIR Battery Candidates Start Practice Today in Gym Coach Walter J. Nelson issued the call for the fi·rst baseball prac- tice of the year yesterday. Today at one o'clock the gymnasium was once again ringing with the shouts of l>atterymen as they tossed easy lobs in the season's opening chal- lenge to the winter's longevity. The battery candidates will get in a week's practice befor·e the can is issued for the rest of the men. Nel- son plans to get outside as soon as possi·ble in preparation for the opening game on the schedule: Middlebury on April 21. One of the needs of the -team- more acute than in many yea;rs-is that of a pitcher. The loss of Guy Griswold !ru;t year put the Garnet team in a bad spot as far as a first rate pitcher goes. Lloyd Waters and Colby Jones will not be avail- able to the team because of scho- lastic standings. From some ob- scure corner of the campus, the Duke must find someone who can toss the ball across the plate at least. Dave Yunich and Van Ladd will probably get the call for the back- stop post. Even in this position the team will surely miss the reliable figw e of AI Stevenson behind the plate.

I. 0. The highlights and leading per- sonalities of the years from 1779 to 1795 which saw the struggle for a college in Schenectady were treated in addresses by Dr. Robert Living- ston Schuyler, professor of history at Columbia University and direct descendant of General Schuyler, and Cadman Hislop, '31, instructor in English. During the cerc::1.onies, President Dixon Ryan Fox accepted a por- trait of General Se'1uyler by J. N. Whittemore, A. N. A., presented to the college on behalf of a group of donors. The portrait will be hung over the fire place in the Hale House Dining Hall this noon as part of the commemorative lunch- eon at which Lieutenant Governor M. William Bray '11, State Histor- ian Alexander C. Flick, President Fox and Dr. Burges Johnson will speak. Given L. H. D. Dr. Schuyler, who was presented with the honorary deg1ee of Doc- tor of Humane Letters this morn- ing, traced the career and person- ality of his ancestor in the prin· cipal address. Paying tribute to a man who, though somewhat overlooked by biographers and historians, plays a great part in American history as soldier, statesman and public bene· factor, Dr. Schuyler said, \It was gracious of you, Mr. President, and of the Trustees of Union College, to invite me to take part in these ex- ercises today, but bringing a Schuy- ler to the Mohawk is not introduc- ing any novelty. It is, I fear, rather like carrying coals to Newcastle.\ Speaking more directly of Philip Schuyler, he said, \Since his day there has been some recognition of the services of the man who sus- tained the Revolutionary cause in one of its darkest hours, the man to whose strategy, in the opinion 00: all careful students of the Saratoga campaign, the credit for the Amer- ican victory is principally due, •• , For his firmness and refusal to despair at any disaster he can be compared to Washington alone.\ Much Maligned Tuesday, Feb. 23.-Ha.:rold G.

He was also Commissioner for Indian Affairs, an advocate of a strong union. and the Constitution, a projector of public improvements and a patron of education. Exploring the character of Philip Schuyler, the speaker found three traits that helped make him the outstanding figure he became. \One of these was an intense love of his country, of a quality that only a country man could know, a sentiment far more vivid than pa- triotism in the abstract,\ he said.

Enzer Robett H. Ferguson Saturday, Feb1uary 2\7 1937 Founders Day Edition Philip Schuyler, renowned for his mili- tary exploits during the Amel'ican Revolu- tion, was one of the original thirty-two cor- porators, whose names appeared on the char- ter presented in 1779 to the New York State legislature for its approval of a college in Schenectady to be called Clinton. Needless to say this charter never was stamped with the legislative seal, and we were thus preserved the dignity of the name Union. Today we welcome the prog-eny, once re- moved, of this doughty frontier patriot to our campus in commen1oration of all that he did with his money and extensive influence towards the founding of Union. Philip's grand-children, Majm~ Schuylee and Profes~ sor Schuyler of Columbia University, give us a touc-h, remote by but a few decades, with our early, energetic history. They are an in- estima:ble link with the past. What they represent is largely the Americanism of their predecessor and his active interest in Amer- ican institutions. We like to think of our small college as characteristic of our nation. Certainly no other country can lay claim to such a widespread system of small colleges as the United States, and it was with just this unique system that Schuyler allied him- self. histone values which ga.-m t en· Import 11'1.

Boyc:e. However, the ediiOl'ial entitled \We Want an Answer-\ seemed to imply that the facilities of the col- lege were inadequate to meet situ- ations of this sort. T\his editorial was untimely and its implications eno:neous. Such unwitting indis- cretion and mis-statement of fact on the part of the e-ditors could cause much ill fe<'ling. It is hoped that a statement ft·orn the editors will clear this situation in the minds of alumni and friends. Sincerely, Tyler E.

John Jay Report S·hows Union I Only College in 1797 Teach- ing Subject I American -Study Required I Classes Given Before Juni01~ I Term on Revolution . And fonstitution . Union College was probably the first college in the United States j to include in it.:; cuniculum a c-ourse In Amnican Hi::~tury. In Chapter IX of the manuscript by-law,; of th~ truotecs Deceniber 1795, entitled \Plan of 'Education,: the following requirement w;s made for admission into the work of the third year; \Before admission into the Mathematical Class, the Student shall ·be acquainted with Geogra- .phy and the Use of the Globes the R?man history and antiquities; the Hu:!tory of America and the Ameri- can . revolution, Chronology, Arith- metic, three books of Xenophon ~orace's Odes & Satires, & Criti: c1sms.\ Mentioned in Regents Letter Although there is no positive proof that the couo~::;e was actually taught, a Jette!\ from a committee of the trustees, appointed to report on the state of the college to the ·~oard of Regents, contains an out- ~me of the co\lrse of study which mcludes \the History of America and the American revolution\ in the work of th.e second year. The letter: concludes: \The president has m the co:..:rse of the present year, instructed the Classes in His- tory, Chronology, A!ltiquities, Geog- ral?~Y? Natura~.& MJral Philosophy, CritiCism, Log.Ic, & the Constitution of the United States & Languages. We are, Gentlemen D. R<Jmeyn Jno. Glen James Shuter Jos. C. Yates\ The letter is dated November 1796. The President at the tim~ was John Blair Smith, D.D., who ~eld o~fic_e from 1795 to 17B9. There IS no md!Cation of just what \His- tory\ the President taught. But the fac_t that the \Constitution of the ymted States\ was actually given 1s_ strong evidence that American history was taught as well as Roman history. In 1197 the Regents of tile Uni- versity of the State of New York combined the reports of the various local com;1111ttees into a single docu- me~t Which was submitted to the legislature. The report begins as follows: \To the Honorable the Legisla- ture \The Regents of the University respectfully re,port \That during the year past, Co- lumbia and Union colleges, and Erasmus Hall, ..... and Lansing- burgh academies have been visited by C<Jmmittees of the Regents, and from the reports of the Commit- tees, the following appears to 'be the State of these Seminaries re- spectively;\ Trustees Rep()rt There follows a report from each of the instituuons mentioned. That on Uni.oz: is essentially the same as the ongmal trustee report of 1796. Alt_hou?h the. history course at U:moz: IS mentione(!, there is no in- ·dlcatwn that such a course was even planned at Columbia, the only other college considered in the re- port. This document is signed by John Jay, who was then Chancellor and Governor of the State. A further bit of evidence is the fact that the li-brary, by 1799 at ~east, ~ad several volumes of .Amer- u:an h1story on its shelves, as the f1rst catalogue indicates. Among these books were a \History of America\ by Russel <two volumes) Smith's \!History of New Y.ork': and Sullivan's \District of Maine.\ ---,0--- Fourth Capehart Recital Will Feature Schubert The fourth in the series of sym- phon.ic recital:> by the Capehart re- cordmg machme will be given next Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock in the Memorial Chapel with Fred Alexander '38 taking charge of the program.

The cost of the handbook will be borne partly by the administration and partly by the student tax. The book will be composed of in· dividual pictures of the freshmen, and of the officers of the college, informal snapshots of the fi·esh- mcn, pictures of the freshman ath- letic teams, and various views of the campus. The volume is to be cloth bound and would, under pres- ent plans, involve an increase of 55 cents pez· person in the student tax, although it is probable that it will be less. Two St>niOI's on Boat·d ThP editorial board is to be made up of a faculty advisot· and two :;eniors, the latter to be chosen yearly by the Publications Board. The committee has not put the plans into final shape as yet, but will do so in time to put it before the Publications Board this spring. The Council hopes to publish the handbook as suun as possible after the opening of school next Septem- ber. probably on m· about Novem- ber 1st. in an effort to make the incoming class better acquainted with each other and thus further class and college unity.

ALMA MATER About Grumble No. 1 March 17! Grumble No. 2 MILT REDI•~LL SPRING TRACK STARTS ON MONDAY Our Grumble nun1ber one has re- ceived a verbal answer .and I pass it on ti!o'Cond-handed. The No. 1 letter evidently meant to infer th!it thE' referee~ used. by Union in it~ basketball games were not too good. Be that as it may, from a very authorative :source we assure r uu tha'l they ax·e the best to be found in this section of the coun- try. Furthermot e, the ~ompetence of tht>ir ability is recogmzed by the fact that some of them have been called upon to 'ref' at the Glens Falls Tournaments. Coach Ketz Issues 'II INTR.AMinALs ] •..

By Freghmen-Varsity Greeks; Both Boxing and Wrestling Stitkmen Practice Both Sides 1 t seems to bE' trUL', especially this yeax·, that more fouls have been called than is usually the case, and the game has been slowed down considerably as a con::;equence. One must take into consideration, however, the fact that mo::;t of the games played here this season have been closely con- tested. and. have required the ut- most from the tefexee::;. These gen- tlemen am no less susceptible to excitement, than are the players. In the mid::;t of a rough and tumble game with players on both tNtms mixing it up, and the ref- erees bounuing around just as ha1·d, it isn't too hatd to under- :,;tand most of their decisions. Pet- :;unally, we would like to f<f'l' a lit- tle less calling of fouls merely to open up and speed up the game generally, but we won't find this by changing referees we already have the three bPst in a radius of fifty miles.

PIDLI;IPPI The Pankration, a sp.ort cembining both hexing v,nd wrestling, was· invented. by the Greeks around the year 500 B. C. 'Phe object of this contest was not to pin an opponent's shoulders, but to force him to admit defeat, and to this end almost any means were allowed. The fight continued until one of the participants was either killed, which was not unusual, or acknowledged defeat.

P. I. Week From Sat- urday; Schultz Will Start On. Jl4arch !), one week from to- morrow night, the Varsity Basket- ball squad will travel to Troy to meet l:t. P. I. in a return engage- ment in '87 gymnasium. The Dutchmen have been prac- ticing intensively' for the past fevv. days with Coach Nels Nitchman stressing possession of the ball and more accurate passing. In the R. P. I, game the Garnet and White threw a way the ball by taking long shots, thus losing possession ann enhancing t)ie visitors•· chances of. scoring. In last weeks' encounter· the courtmen were very lax: irt de- fense, allowing the Trojans to take .numerous shots some of which were bound to· result in baskets. Next Saturday's lineup will prob- ably consist of Captain Ted Pod- bielskl and Johnny Schultz at for- wards, Charlie Wiberly at cente1 and Kenny Brown and Dave Miller. · at the guard positions. Nels will have to· depend greatly on George· Doyle and Vince Smith as frequent substitutions as the game will in a:ll p1,obability be close and the fouls numerous. Grant Smith win not play because of his ineligibility.

Podbielski defin.itel) had a \cold\ night in Saturday·~ game and Is due for a \hot\ one. The play Saturday night was very ragged but with intensive drilling this week and next it is expectea that the Dutchmen will go to Tro) a well-knit team and return the victors. The coming battle with the En-. gineers is the last game of the season for the Union team and also the last game for Kenny Brown who has performed consist- ently well all year. The Garnet will be idle until this tilt while R. P. I. will meet State College and Bard Colleg-e over the week-end. The boys from across the river should win these games and be well prepared for the Nitchman five when they arrive in Troy. ---0·--- Battery Candidates Report for Practice All Unseasoned Men Except Waters and Yunich; Large and Stiff Schedule With eleven candidates out for the pitching staff and four for the backsto.p position, it would be as- sumed that Coach Walter \Duke\ Nelson would have an easy- job picking out a reliable mound staff. This, however, is not the case. Of the eleven candidates out for mound duty there is not a letter man among them, and only- one with varsity- experience. Of the four catchers, only one has had college experience, and that with the Frosh team. Lloyd Waters is the only ma.n with varsity experience, and thus, much is expected from him. Colby .Jones who received his numerals last year for pitching for the Fresh, is a close second to Waters in experience. George Stewart also pitched for the Frosh last year, but he did not receive his num- erals. W. C. Robbins is in the same boat with Stewart. Joe LubaJJsky and Jake Amazon were Fresh in- fielders but are out for the pitch- ing staff this year. Pat Sands and George Haskell, the only senior out for the staff, have had no col- l().ge experience. Not much is known about Day and Luke as they- reported Thursday for the first time. Ladd No-t Out The catching department is as badly off If not worse than the pitching staff. Dave Yunich, who caught last year for the Fresh and who received his numerals for it, seems to be the logical choice for the position as Van Ladd, who was practically conceded the position, has not yet reported, and it is rather doubtful if he will do so. Of the other three candidates: Jailk Sloatmalll, Zygmunt Szczom- browski, and Tyler Dennett, none have had any college experience. !t is up to Duke to bring forth from this group a pitching and catching staff that will stand the ga:ff of one of the hardest sched- ules ever to face a Union baseball team. Thirteen games have been s:cheduled this year; eight bonae games ancl five out of town games. The sea,son opens here on April 2ll, with Middlebury.

Ends Fair Season ~ ConquEst of Mont Pleasant Ma.rked Highlight Of Four Victcries Failing to keep up the pace which the ·fres·hman cross-countt·y and football team set this year, the: frosh basketball .outfit did not manage te> come through its sched-. ule unscathed, but dl'Opped two of · its six games. The season, which was concluded with a victory over. the R. P. I. yearlings last Satur- day, nevel?theless was a successful one, alth~>ugh the outfit did not come up to pre-season expecta- tions. Rated hefore they had been seen in actioJJ as one of the best fresh- man te~uns in several years, .the ~irst year men looked good the first rew weeks of practice, and many ;>redicted an undefeated season.· Every position seemed to be well fortified with ex:cellen t material, 3.nd with such potential luminaries· 1s Lou Kozlevcar and Herb Wat- son; the outfit seemed very capa- ble of easily taking the six games. \Tro-y 'Wins First The very first game provided dis- aster, h()wever, as Troy High School, always a strong team, won the initial contest, i!O to 24. The freshmen: had considerable diffi- culty in penetrating the Trojan zone defense, and although Glenn and Wats<>n played fine ball, the final score was all for Troy. In the second ga:me at Manlius, the year- lings finally came into their own, and wit:h Miller and Watson throw- ing in last minute baskets, the frosh won 30 to 28, as Manlius failed to sinlt an easy layup shot that wcllld have meant victory. The third away game was at Mont Pleasant High School, and this time the freshmen scored the most impressive win of the campaign.

Poersch '18, chairman of the Schenectady County Democratic Committee, urged students in Cha- pel today to join a political party and become a committee member, because in that way \you will be aiding your party and malting yourself a part of the function of democratic government under which we live.\ We are touched by politics on all sides because our conduct is controlled by the government, Poersch began. It is vitally neces- sary that a greater percentage of people take a greater interest in the politics of our country, and youth trained to go into politics as a profession. If not, the student should at least be made more cog- nizant of politics. It is in the campaign fight that the real thrill of politics shows it- self abundantly. \It is in the midst of the campaign that the actual functioning of democratic govern- ment takes place,\ Poersch stated. Poersch pointed out that in the early history of this country par- ticipation in politics was left to the few. Everyone left politics to his next fellow man. \Its history is not even wholesome or desirable,\ he said. ---0----- Favors and Decorations Arranged for Prom ===:.mmmm::::::m:m:::m::m:::m::::::::m::m::m::m:::m:m:::m:::m:::::::mm:::::m::m:::m:mm::::m:::m:~~~ ill ill m s p-· r 0 1 n g m ill ill m • • • • m ill ill ~ ~ ill ill Ill is in the air! !!!
