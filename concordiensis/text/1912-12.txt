As it is not tn)r purpose here to disc11ss the undeTgTaduate' s phi1osoph~· of l:ifL', I \Yill but remark that the student acti ,,._ itics are btl t the bark on the tree of know1- ec1g·e: it is atnusi n~· to carve your initial there, hut the fruit of the tree gTO\YS. high up an1ong tht• brancbes. \Vhcre one individual is \Yil1- ing· to d in1b and eat, there arc a c1ozen sa tis- lied with peeling the hark. Dep1orab1e as this is, the reason -is shn ple. It is far easier \vith bitter reg-rets, that, although '\ye have n1ade good friends and studied son1e ·' \Ve have never reallY brovvsed in the field of finer '\' to pee1 the b:..trk, and besides there is an im- n1en1orial and vopnlar tra<.1ition that it is ''bad fon11 ·' 1< > d in1 b the tree and interfc1 e with the professors hidden a1nong the leaves anc1 heroically pc lting· the students \rith the dried fruit! But the n1ost \~ital, real and potent force that stirs the student body is that indefinable, 111astering cspri t c1 e cor1)S kno\Yl1 as ''college spirit.'' Its do1ni-nant cle1nent is loyalty; its itnn1ediate encl. solidarity; its personal effect, an unquestioning-, self-effacing devotion to the community '\velfare. as that is conceived in the prevailing- st11dent opinion; its out\vard t.'xpression, an exhilarating enthusiasn1. It is akin to patriot-isn1: it borders on relig- ious fanaticis1n.

But the students in col1egL' to-day are chiefly responsib1e for the preva1ling· and often de~ermining elements in its con1position. rrhe true culture is n~>t to be produced by mechanical tneans.
