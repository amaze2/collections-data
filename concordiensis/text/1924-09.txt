Under the sidewalk the steam pipes from the central heating plant have been laid, so· that in the future it will npt be necessary to tear up the road to locate trou·ble in the system. A ·ne.w Memorial gateway is under. construction on South liane near Un- ion avenue. The gateway was planned about a year ago by the class rof 1884 as a memorial to the deceased mem- bers of the class. Ilion fencing and gates will be added and some time be-· ·fore the end of the college year the 3~ructure will be dedicated. W. T Mynderse of Schenectady .designed the gate and the construction work has been under the supervision of' Cha·rles K Varney. Since the cornerstone of the new. Memo•rial chapel was laid at the Oom- mencement exercises in June, consider- able prog.ress has ·been made. In ad- dition to the stonework of th'e .founda-. tion, the brick walls ha·ve been built. up for a number -of feet and it is ex:-. pected that the building will be enclosed be.fore C:old weather. According t'O rpres~nt plans, the chapel' will 1be used at the <Commencement exercises in 192i5.
