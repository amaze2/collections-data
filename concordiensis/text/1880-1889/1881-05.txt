Between the trees, Flooding her lovely face with light,- \V e sat at ease. Mary and I, flirting were we ; My arm was, where it ought to be, Around her waist ; my other paw Clasped one of hers-I say no more ; Imagine, I)lease. II. We talked of love, the moon, and such Trifles like air. I told her that I liked her much And thought her fair. I said all other p:retty n1aids Compared with beT were sorry jades. She said she always thought before That beardless boys were such a bore, · Till I ca1ne there. III.

The numerous n1agazines, periodicals and ne\vspapers of the present day presenl a \vide field for \vriters of all descriptions and n1erits. Each week bears on to oblivion an unlitn- ited mass ot literature, essays by \vould-be thinkers, \veak poen1s, old biographies re- \Vritten, aud various dissertations o·n all subjects. The production \vhich surviyes this avalanche is \VOrthy of consideration. l\1an y an article, e~en by authors of merit, no\v occupies the attention of the public for only a day and is dismissed from all thought and rem en1 brance. The literary world abounds in \bores the mere \makers of phrases;\ and the man wh%o produces anything which has a just claim to interest and attention is hailed by the people vvith a cry of approbation and thankfulness. The shout which \velcomed Ed win Arnold's \Light of Asia,\ has not yet died a\vay, but \vill for a long titne be echoed through the halls of fame. As a poem it baffles criticism. Never \vill the reader's interest wax inconstant. lt now n1eanders quietly and peacefully through the shining vale of poetry, now bounds amid scenes of splendor and gran- deur, and anon thunders over cataracts of astounding rnystery, a\v~tkening echoes of the supernatural and the sublin1e. The entire scene is one of continuous change, but of enchanting- harmony. The poetn both an1uses and instructs, breathes forth an attnosp here tor the soaring in1agination and leads the mind in the deepest channels of thought. It is rich in the viv1d imagery ot the east and boldly ex presses the doctrines of one of I the old religions of the earth. Poetry is the n1 ns t p 1 easing n1 ed i u m of I itnparting inforn1atiQn. and this n1ethod bns
