There is no good reason why our contest shall not excite as n1uch attention and de- velop as fine playing as that of the New England colleges.

I have learned front a reliable source -and it is strange that so many are blind to the facts of the case-that the entire sum of 1noney used in building Memorial Hall was given by friends of the College and with the understanding that it be devoted to that ob- ject and that alone.
