In the fall of 1862, just. before tl:te college re-opened, Prof. Peissner took command otth€ One Hundred and Nineteenth New York Volunteers. At last he was fully enlisted in the cause which was the dearest on earth to him, and the full significance of which he understood most thoroughly; first by the quick sympathy of a heart warm with the love of liberty aud justice, and then by the profound study which he had made of our po- litical life, and the clear conviction. which he had of the value of the Republic to human Jlrogress everywhere and always. His record as a soldier is brief, but it is very characteristic. He was as faithful to his men as he had been to his students, and he mastered every de- tail of his new profession with the rapid intelligence and the intense application ·which he bad shown in his old one. When his regiment lay in camp facing the en- emy one of his superior .officers rem.al'ked, 1 ' We can lie down in safety to-night, for Peissner has command of the pickets.\ The words wei·e, in little, the descrip- tion of his admirable character. Whoever came in con- tact with hnn instinct1vely felt this unreserved confi- dence that whatever a, generous sense of duty could de- mand he would be Slll'B to give. I need not say that he was brave. His was the courage at once of a strong nature and of a lofty id~al. Wlutt were the dangers of the field to a soul which saw in its imn1ediate surround- ings scope for the -noblest activity~ ancl which s'iw, be- yond, the infinite worth of the caR~e wh1ch it was serv- ing? When he crossed the Ra:ppahannock, the first man of that gallant and ill-fated A.1·my of the Potomac, he knew that whether he lived or diecl his acts were linking the efforts of all the past to the :possibilities of . freedom and progress in t.he continual future. When, on that terrible morning of the 2d of May,he rode cahn- ly down the lines, hold1ng his mea firm against the fierce onset that was sca,ttering those on either side, he knew that those who fell ia that tight ±en as the seed fall~, making the great harvest poRsible. Anti. yet, when this heroic soldier of anive1·sal freedom., this patriot whose patriotism was deeper than lov:e o:f count~y,lay mortally wounded, h1s last words, w h1Ch a stricken comrade gathered from his lips, were a p:ra.yer that touches the An able response was made by Col.

The CONCORDIENSIS, as our readers have probably noticed, is of a curious turn of mind; yet all we ever ask for is the truth. Some simple-minded questions have excited great ind ;gnation in the breasts of certain distinguished ,,persons-good evidence that the truth is distasteful to said persons. Enough. I.

Who told him? by but one purpose in common; to maintain its repu- tation, iDcrease 1ts scholarship,and uphold its President alike th:rough good and evilreports,-Ji}vening Star. What induces the local editor of the Star to make this statement? An apparently fair statement. ''Reputation\ is an ambiguous word. But does the Editor kno\v that to elevate the reputation and scholarship of Union College, and to uphold its President are propositions entirely irreconcilable, con- tradictory? Go and ask the grey-haired Professors, the young Profe~sors, the stu- dents.

A consulta- tion of the base-hit and error columns will make this evident. The college men far out-batted, and, with the single exc~ption above noted, out-fielded them. Moore, Mountain and Ahern batted superbly, while Beattie and Ford did fine work in the field, the latter putting out 7 n1en without an error. Ford has not made an error on the campus this year, and has played four games vvith professionals without an error. · A no- ble record. Rogers and Taylor played their usual reliable, steady game.

Senator fron1 185 I to 1864 when he resigned, ~~d from 1867 to 1869 \vhen he surrendered hts place to his son. 'r:1. l~ev. Staats Van Santvoord recently celebrated the 9oth anniversary of his birth- da v at Ne\v Bahin1ore. It \vas a day of great festivities and tnan y friends were pres- ent. Mr. Van Santvoord paid his old col- · lege a visit during comn1encetnent. this year . Driving up to the 'f{egistrar's office, he sent his son in to tell Prof. Pearson that there \vas a boy outside \vho vvanted to enter col- lege and therefore \vished to see the Pro~ fess.or-an old bov indeed. '25. Francis N. Mann, one of the \vealthiest gentlernen 1n this section of this State, died at his residence in T'roy, recently, aged 78 years. He \vas graduated at Union College in I 82 5, \vas thrice lVIayor of Troy, Judge of the old ·Court of Common Pleas of Rensse . laer county, and also held at different tin1es irnportant public offices. He leaves t\vo sons and one daughter, the latter the wife of the Hon. Hamilton Fish, Jr. His elder son \vas a men1ber of Assen1bly last year and is no\v Aide-de-Carn p on Gov. Cor- nell's staff. '28. Gen. Robert Toon1bs \vas chosen to deliver the Phi Sig1na oration at the recent commencement of ~lississippi University. The General in all probability had to put a restraint upon himself for he is inclined to express himself very forcibly. Imrnediately after the nornination of the H.epu blican con- vention at Chicago, in a conversation \Vith Gen. Gordon, he said : \ 1 d1dn't know that the d - fools had sense enough to norn- inate a mai1 like him.\ '48. The National Republican Convention at Chicago has seen fit to honor one of U n- ion's sons, Gen. Chester :\. Arthur, by nom- inating him for Vice-President of the United States. He entered the Sophomore class of Union College ~t the age of sixteen, gradua- ting at 19 with high honors. He was a dili- gent and popular student and vvas recog- nized as a n1an of ability and p1:omise. His standing in his class of 107 members \vas very high. He received the highest possi- ble n1ark every term but one, and the aver- age of his 'vhole college course was 299 6-7 on a scale of 300. He was a member of the Psi Upsilon Fraternity, and has ever taken a deep interest 1n its \velfare. Atter leaving college he entered upon the profession of law in \vhich he has achieved signal success. He \vas formerly a partner of Erastus D. Culver and since 1871 has been leader of the firm Arthur, Phelps, Knevals & Ransom. He won a national reputation in the celebra-

Ward, in Scranton, and was ad- mitted to the bar of Luzerne Co .. on the 30th of August, 1864. ·He located at Pittston and at once entered upon a large and lucrative practice. The members ot the Luzerne Co. bar convened March 27th to take action re- garding his death. Many and fitting . eulo- gies \Vere pronounced by his brother la \i\T- yers. He 'vas a good christian. A short ti1ne before his death, he lost three children in two weeks. Speaking of this affliction to a friend he said, ~' Son1etimes I feel rebel- lious, but then I see others suffering in sotne greater 'vay, and at once feel_ I _~ave very much for which to be thankful. Those gone do not need me, hence I vvant to live to com- fort and provide ior those here. Outside of this, I have no choice personally. But while I live, I propose to make the most of life possible.\ Surely we need more such law- yers. '63. All honor to '63. She has presented a bronze statue of Prof. ;C( I p I
