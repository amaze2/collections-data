I 'VANDERED in Arcadia's dreamful realm, When dew of morning lay upon, the world, And in it every floweret was empearled By that bright sun of promise, whose sweet rays Lig·htened with life of loye and beauty, all my days. Tbere rippling· rills the daisies overwhelm, That skirt the shores of the enameled mead; There Pan blew music from the oaten reed, And nll the chorus of the Nymphs and Fauns Gleamed in the mazy dance, on those enchanted lawns. Adown the joyous pathway of that past A g-lory fell, that filled the hours with pride; For lo! she came, more fair than Tithon's bride, And her white brow was love's imperial shrine, While nameless grc.tce was blent in face and form divine. Her witching words an echoing cadence cast, Blown from the harp .<Eolian of the soul To chords of that, she erstwhile did control In that aur 1rttl prime ; and when she smiled, Lilies and maribellos bloomed fot·th upon the wi!d. Yet, like a running river in the hand, Those visions of a fair dissolving view Elapse, nor will they ever more be true ; Till Memory, the enchanter, lifts the screen And swiftly backward glide the g·littering· between. Life is the thinker's thought, so golden land Where love hung- on the rosy lips of Youth, years They who have quaffed thy magic wells of truth, Still by thy singing· streams will aye sojourn ; B.eturn Arcadian days, Arcad~an hout·s return!

FOR unavoidable reasons consequent upon . the opening o£ the term, we are forced to appear late with this issue. N OW that the lectures by Judge Landon have given the Seniors a knowledge o£ the Constitution why not resolve the senior class into a Senate ? The custom is a good one and on old one and it seems too bad that it should I be allowed to die out. The principal objec- tion seems to be that the Seniors do not care to pass an examination on Parliamentary law, as the last class were compelled to, but we think that this would not be ~1ecessary if the students would endeavor to give their reasons; and the practice was very beneficial _and es- pecially so to those who intend taking· up the law as a profession. The custom is beneficial, not only in the practice given in Parliamen- tary law and Constitutional law, but also .. in the chances for debates. In the matter o£ debates and general o1·atorical practice _alnong students, Union is weak, and, here is a chance £or the Seniors to remedy the evil and benefit themselves. The Ooncordiensis would like to see the Senate go in session as soon as the course of lectures is finished. O NCE again the observance o£ the ceremony o£ Cremation has come and gone, and the usual reflections consequent upon the increas- ing rowdyis1n called forth by its observance have beon aroused. Those who have wit- nessed this ceremony £or the last few years, can scarcely deny that the actions o£ the students each year become more and 1nore I N our last issue we published an article upon unworthy of those participating. This year the conferring o£ the degree o£ B. S., the use o£ clubs upon small provocation ·was instead o£ A. B., on Scientifics. We publish the feature which more than any other called in this issue an article on the other side o£ forth the expressions o£ disapproval £rom the the question, and are glad that we are able upperclassmen.
