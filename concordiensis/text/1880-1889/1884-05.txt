Under ·such circun1stances we cannot be surprised at there being so n1any vacant seats every 1norning, but would wonder rather if chapel attendance had not been avoided. If the college law requiring students to attend chapel be still considered salutary, it should be enforced; if not dee1ned so, then its in1- Inediate abolishn1ent would be in order. The con- tinued evasion with in1punity of one rule en1boldens the students to evade others, and 1nust be subversive in the end of that good order which is inseparable frotn a thriving institution.

124 THE CONCORDIENSIS. True, it is sotnetimes said that all claim to regard is forfeited by their own conduct\; but the fact that others act ungentlemanly is no excuse for our doing the same. Notwithstanding the fact that our students are as little open to censure in this respect as those ·of any \ college, still it tnust be owned that we are at tilnes a '! little heedless, and hardly do as we would be done by. By polite and courteous conduct we can lose nothing, but will be raised in the estitnation of those with whotn we con1e in contact, and what is of yet n1ore value, will increase our own self-respect. Therefore, fellow-students, let us not lose sight of the fact that, in even so comparatively trivial an affair as a ball match, it is our duty to act as becomes gentlen1en ; and while our nine may be, and probably is, the terror of all competitors, we, as students of Union College, 1nay, for politeness and courtesy, gain a reputation as enviable as that which we already possess on the \ diamond.\ COMMENCEMENT is again drawing near, and we would suggest to those in authority that they tnake sure that no one appeanng on the stage palms off another's oration as his own. This suggestion is not made through any susptc1on that there is one in the graduating class who would be guilty of this deed. On the contrary, we do not be- lieve there is one who would stoop so low. However, as we all know, such a thing has been done when there was as little apparent cause for suspicion as at presen~. We can readily conceive with how little satisfaction or interest an oration purporting to be original could be listened to, if the thought constantly uppermost in the mind of the hearer w~s, \ I wonder where he • \'I \ got 1tr That plagiarisn1 is held in contempt, and to what an extent, the recent experience of a young preacher not far distant is a case in point. \ Cribbing\ among students is not due, perhaps, to incompetency so 1nuch as to that bane of hntnan life in whatever station,-procrastination. Essay and oration writing is work that the average student dislikes, and, as a consequence, it is put off until the last mo1nent, when not having time to collect and formulate his own ideas, he adopts the easier mode and copies those of another. I-lowever 1nuch 1 this practice tnay be deprecated in private work, it ~ should be made sure beyond the\ shadow of a doubt\ that all work presented to the public as original should be so. A student 1nay, perhaps, practice this deceit without discovery ; but the chances are greatly against it, and, in case of detection, the result and injury is not sustained by the offender alone ; great discredit is re- flected upon the institution and all connected with it. The best safeguard against this evil is the self-respect and honor of the individuals concerned; but if, as sornetimes happens, there is son1e one lacking in these qualities of true rnanhood, other n.1ethods shouLd be adopted to secure the desired end. LICENSE AND PROHIBITION. THAT the sale and use of alcoholic beverages is an unn1itigated evil, few thinking men will deny. The only question is, whether restrictive or prohibitory n1easuTes afford the better ren1edy; for these terms show the real difference between the two methods of treating the disease : one endeavors to restrain it as n1uch as possible, while still pennitting its existence; the other aitns at its co1nplete annihilation. Prohibition is ahnost always put in a false light by .. the assumption of its enen1ies, that it is not successful unless the liquor- traffic is entirely suppressed. They regard the fact that where this systetn is in force many are still able to evade it, as a telling argument against it, and n1ake the assertion that, as 1nen n1ust and will have their dram in spite of law, prohibition is useless. On the other hand its advocates have done much to bring about this feeling by seeming to claim that the utter extinction of the traffic would follow its adoption. So that it is not strange if its foes judge the system by the claims of its friends. But this view is as absurd as it is false. Prohibition, indeed, aims at the extinction of the trade in intoxica- ting drinks, just as other laws aitn to subdue crime. But who expects that because robbery or n1urder is the subject .of legal enactments it will utterly cease? If the incomplete enforcement of laws is an argun1ent against thetn, it might be brought against any or every law with as much reason as against prohibition. For- geries and robberies follow each other in startling sue.,. cession, city gambling hells are in full blast all the year round, thousands of crilninals go unpunished, yet not one ad vises us to cease our struggle against these evils. On the contrary, a crilne of unusual wick- edness is urged as a reason for stern~r measures. The absurdity of the argument is recognized at once when applied to ordinary criminal law. But it is urged with even less reason against prohibition, for public opinion is finnly united in condemnation of other vices, while, to say the least, there is great difference of opii1ion in regard to the vice of drinking.

The older system has nothing desired? Can we expect complete success here, when to boast of in this respect. There were recently in we see. other laws, acknowledged by all to be just, New York city not less than three thousand unlicensed broken with impunity? liquor shops, as appeared in the trial of a saloon- But we 1nust also ren1ember, in judging of the success keeper for illegal selling, and his conviction for viola- of prohibition, that the object of all government is tion of the license law was the first that had been ob- primarily the protection of law-abiding citizens, and tained there in twenty years ! Nor is this an isolated that the punishment of crime is only an incidental case ; the system ,is £1 dead letter almost everywhere necessary to secure that object. So that it is no argu- , that it exists.

And, consequently, while license is The reforn1ation of the individual cri1ninal, though an nowhere enforced to any extent, these laws are, in end for which we should most earnestly strive, is of spite o£ the opposition of foes and the apathy of far less importance than the protection of society. friends. The design of prohibitionists, therefore, is not so much to prevent all drinking as to shut up those gates of hell, those brilliant saloons, into which so n1any of our noblest young tnen are enticed and ruined for time and for eternity. It is not through n1alice or ill- will to any, or to rob any of his rights, but to protect our own firesides, our own friends and brothers and sons, that we den.1and their suppression. If these aims are accomplished, if beer-saloons and grog-shops no longer flaunt their repulsive signs at every corner, and tear our dear ones frotn our grasp to fill drunkards' graves; if the penalties are great enough to deter 1nen from giving way to appetite, we shaH be satisfied, and prohibition will be anything but a failure, even though the l'i\w be still broken in secret by those who are slaves to ICing Alcohol. This is all that we expect from other laws, and all we can expect from this. We ask the same standard of success for prohibition as is taken for other legislative enactlnents. Following out the principles discussed above, let us compare the success of license and prohibition in di- minishing the evils of intemperance. As the principal argument advanced to show that the latter has been a failure is its incotnplete enforcetnent where it has been Hon. Woodbury Davis says of the Maine law : \Of our four hundred towns and cities, making the esti- mate below what I believe the facts wou.ld justify, I am convinced that in 1nore than one hundred the law prevents any sale of liquors whatever as a beverage. In at least two hundred towns liquors are sold only 'on the sly.' In the other one hundred towns they are sold probably without 1nuch restraint. * * * · .. And though the law is but partially enforced, prosecu- 1 tions under it are numerous and constant, even in i places where large quantities are sold.\ This is not I as good a record as it should be; but where has license beei1 even as well enforced as this? Where are \prosecutions under it\ \numerous and con- i stant? \ In this respect prohibition ha~ had the I : greater success. But apart from the question of enforcement, which i of the two svste1ns under discussion has done the most I to dhninish \the evils arising from the use of intoxica- 1 ting drinks? License has been tried not only for a I much longer time, but also in far 1nore places than i prohibitory legis1ation ; there has been greater oppor- 1 tunity to judge of its effects. Yet what are they? i Undoubtedly, the nutnber of places where liquors are

126 THE CONCORDIENSIS. sold is smaller than if no attempt were made to sup- press the traffic, and restrictive n1easures are some- what of a success. But while we can only in1agine the state of things which would exist without the1n, the condition of society which has been pennitted and fostered by them, stares us everywhere in the face. A system under which $6oo,ooo,ooo are spent every year in the United ~tates for liquors, and which licenses one hundred and forty thousand saloons to sell to five million, six hundred thousand ddnkers has not done 1nuch to suppress the traffic. Whether we consjder these startling statistics, which show that the annual cost of strong drinks is ahnost three ti1nes as great as the cost of flour and 1neal, or open our eyes to the effects of drunkenness at our very doors, the success of license is equally apparent. In whatever way we look at it the fact still retnains that under this system saloon-keepers can ply their trade with scarcely a restriction, and evade or Lreak with impunity the laws which tend to interfere with it. Not only does license fail here, but it is the only thing which gives a shadow of respectability to the business, and by mak- ing it respectable it helps to lure hundreds to a drunk- ard's doon1 who would recoil fron1 the hideous naked- ness of the vice if it were· not legalized. Can a law that is not only not a hindrance but even a positive aid to the spread of the evil which it is designed to suppress be called successful? On the other hand, it cannot be clai1ned that the success of prohibition is con1plete, but still it has done much to right the greatest wrong the world has ever seen. In Maine, the \pioneer State,\ the law, first enacted in 1846, has diminished the trade to less than one-tenth of its former Inagnitude., has banished it from extensive districts, and where it still lingers it finds safety only in secrecy. Thousands have been prevented fron1 being drawn astray by open bar-rooms, unnumbered ho1nes have been saved fron1 the demon of strong drink. In spite of an increasing population, crime and pauperisn1 have steadily di1ninished. The number sentenced to prison and reform-school in I 866 was 204; by 1872 this nurrrber had decreased to one hundred! These facts are corroborated by the testi- Inony of the fore1nost men of the State. An internal revenue officer wrote in 18 7 2 : \The beer trade is not more than one per cent. of what I remember it to have been.\ ~- Mr. Blaine says : \It can now be said with truth that there is no equal number of people in the Anglo- Saxon world among whon1 so s1nall an amount of in- toxicating liquor is consumed as among the six hun- I : dred and fifty thousand inhabitants of Maine.'' I : The con1n1ander of a Russian 1nan-of-war, which was 1noored for several weeks in the ports of the State, adds his testimony : \ I never saw anything so won- derful as your Maine law. We allow our 1nen to go on shore freely, and they come on board at night sober and happy. If liquors were sold on shore we should not allow them to go there, as they would be- come drunk and insult your people. It is a pleasure and benefit for thern to go on shore, and I like to have then1 do so.\ Could this be said of any seaport where dran1-selling is licensed? The prohibitory law in Connecticut went into· force on the rst of August, rS54· In New Haven the com- mitlnents for drunkenness and petty critnes during July, under license, were one hundred and twenty- three.; in August, under prohibition, thirty-eight. In New London, during August and Septen1ber, 1853, the comn1itments nun.1bered thirty-two; during the san1e 1nonths of 1854, only fifteen. Trimble county, IZentucky, thanks to a noble judge, has no licensed saloons, and consequently has hardly a criminal case on her docket or a drunkard in her streets ; while other counties, with I~icensed rum-sellers, have their dockets crowded, and n1urder after 1nurder, ahnost all caused by whiskey. These are but a few of the statistics which n1ight be presented to show that crin1e, while increasing under the more prevalent systen1, decreases under prohibi- tion. Even the advocates of the fonner n1ust adtnit this. The city government of Boston, at the begin- ning of 1868, when license was restored after a year of strictly enforced prohibition, appropriated nearly $zo,- ooo more than during the previous year for the \Houses of Correction and Industry,\ showing that they expected an increase in crime ! But prohibition not only ditninishes drunkenness and its attendant vices, but also lessens the burden of the tax-payer, and by re1noving its chief cause aln1ost banishes poverty. The average tax on ·liquors per capita in three prohibitory States, Maine, New Hamp- shire and Massachusetts, was, a few years ago, about $o.s 8 ; in three States where ruin was free, Maryland, Indiana and Ohio, it a1nounted to $3.91, nearly seve1z times as n1uch ! Ohio paid thirty-five tirr1es as much as Maine for each inhabitant, and nineteen ti1ues as 1nuch as New Hampshire. Vineland, N.J., was founded in I86I, and in .1873 had a population of over ten thousand. Frotn its foundation the trade in alcoholic drinks has been pro- hibited. Below is a table showing its expenses co1n-

Rut this is not all·; the place has had an 1~nexa1npled pros- perity, and knows ahnost nothing of the evils of intern.- perance. Greeley, Colorado, is a recent colony of about three thousa:1d inhabitants, where no liquor selling is per- n1itted. Not long after its foundation the proceeds of a fair, amounting to ninety -one dollars, were set apart for the poor, but after two years and a half, eighty-four remained uncalled for ! But why 1nultiply statistics when they all tell the same story? when they all ·show the failure of license and the success of prohibition? It is impossible to enforce the former; the latter can be and is enforced. Drunkenness, crime and pauperisn1 increase under the former, and with them the expense of government ; the reverse is true under the latter. Add to these facts the opposition of the rum-sellers to prohibition, which shows that they fear its effects on their business, and who can doubt which system has succeeded? Liquor selling is a cri1ne, and the only rational way to deal with it is to treat it as a crime. This prohibi- tion alone does. Its reasonableness and its good effects wherever tried are hastening its adoption in every civilized nation. Its success may be delayed, it may be temporarily defeated here and there, but its final triumph is inevitable. Its progress will be as re- sistless as an avalanche ; n1en may oppose it-only to be buried beneath it. · We do not expect more fro1n it than from other laws; it will in no way diminish the necessity of\ moral suasion,\ but great will be the ad- vantage if this offense against society is recognized and punished as a crilne; if the temptations which. now beset the path of the young and of those easily led astray are removed ; if the State no longer is the accomplice of the rum-seller in the ruin of ,its citizens. We must toil and wait before our efforts are crowned with success, cheered meanwhile by the knowledge that the right must and will prevail! HOPEFUL. -· --------···--- -- --- ·-··--------· -·-- A. L. KING, '54, of Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory, was recently visiting friends at Schenectady. hance the reputation of our college. The first 1nistake is n1ade when the office of editor is considered one of the spoils of class contests and a reward for political services. No one would be so fool}sh as to select a player f9r the college nine be- cause he was a popular student or controlled a certain clique ; yet, for editor, these are generally the power-. ful qualifications. Of course, it is not as easy to judge of n1ental fitness as it is of physical; but even so, it ·could be justly complained that no atte1npt at judg- Inent is even n1ade. When there are two factions in a class, each party should select one editor and pern1it the outgoing board to choose the third, This would ensure two experienced men from the two upper classes on the board of editors, and would prevent any injustice being done through the columns of the paper to any, otherwise, unrepresented faction. It would be advantageous also, I believe, to elect only part of the editors in June, and to select the re- rnainder in January you would thus have the enthusi- asn1 which comes from the efforts of beginners, to- gether with the experience of those who held over. This would of course necessitate the continuance as editors of son1e of the present board but this I think ' ' ' is a strong argument in its favor. Hoping that the above may receive a careful con- . sideration, I respectfully sign 1nyself NEMO. THE CLASS OF FIFTY-FOUR.

On May I 6, our nine played the Cornell nine on our own grounds and added another victory to their list. A cold wind blew during the afternoon and made it rather unpleasant for the audi~nce and play- ers. Nevertheless, it was a close and interesting game up to the eighth inning. In this inning, by good batting, and aided by several costly errors of Cornell, our nine scored six runs and won the gatne. \ Pendy's\ pitching was the feature of the game, sev- enteen of the Cornell 1nen r:;triking out.

By far the 1nost interesting game of the season so far was that with Williams, May 2 I, on our own grounds. The Williams men came confident that they could beat Union, and in truth they came as near to winning as they could and not win. About forty men cmne with the nine, and this no doubt encouraged them to do their best. No runs were made until the fifth inning, when the visitors scored on a bad error by Stanton. In the sixth, Mullen led off, after two men were out, with a base hit and stole second; McElwain braced himself and sent a long one to right center, sending Mullen home and making second for himself. Naylon then sent a hot one over to left on which McElwain scored the winning run amidst great excitetnent. This was the last run made on either side, although

.. THE CONCORDIENSIS. 131 Albany Lavv School. PROPHESY~CLASS'S4. JOHN H. MOFFETT. J N very ancient ti1nes a prophet was what is now known as a poet, and to prophesy was to sing. Fortunately for your sense of appreciation as well as for the success of my own efforts, these tenus have undergone a remarkable change, and 1ny task, in the light of 1nodern .parlance, is only that of exercising the faculty of guessing well. But this idea is subject to a slight rnodification in the case at bar_, inas1nuch as there is, of course, to be no guess work upon my part, but plain and unsophisticated facts.' Not long since, as I was conten1plating the grand possibilities of the future, 1ny n1ind intuitively, yet naturally, confronted the inquiry : 'Vhat is to becon1e of the Albany Law boys of '84? Our tern1 of school was drawing to a close; n1any the n1emories which cluster around our sojourn together and n1any the hopes which elate our atnbitions. I· looked into the faces of fellow schoolmates, so1newhat fan1iliar with their past~ but could only conjecture as to their future. The 1nystery was at last revealed. In the dead silence of the night, Morpheus, whose acute eye is ever open to penetrate the 111azes of the great un- , known, can1e to the scene of troubles and told that story which I had long desired to know and which I will now tell to you-the future of the Albany Law Class of '84. It is the sun11ner of r 900. A few weeks ago I was running a peanut stand on a prominent street in Chi- cago, but as the nickels did n't co1ne in according to my ideas of trade, I soon went into bankruptcy, and after paying about r 2c. on the dollar, I felt financially able to take a trip across the country. A reporter of the Chicago Ti1nes, who was prepar- ing an article to be entitled\ Biography of Anonyn1ous Characters,\ desired to accompany me in the interest of his forthco1ning production. Arrangen1ents all made, we started south across the sandy plains of Illinois. The iron horse soon pulled us into the city of IZankakee. After going around some four blocks, to avoid passing the saloons, we be- gan reading signs, and ou~ eyes soon fell upon the fol- lowing: \Paddock & Banks, Attorneys and Counselors at Law.\ These genial chu1ns of the Albany Law School were engaged in a very extensive and lucrative prac- tice. Their social qualities had brought to then1 n1any clients, friends and admirers. Banks had married -- -~--~-------~- ~ ~- so1ne years before, but Paddock still persisted 111 re- maining a confirmed bachelor. We next crossed the line into Indiana. A village daily, of July 9th, contained this notice : \Harry Booden, LL .. D., of Pease Co., Hooppole P. 0., Ind., , will speak at Union Square this evening at 8 o'clock on i .the subject ' Love: Its Irresistible and Controlling In- 1 fluences.' \ We were informed that Booden had made I a special study of the subject and w:ould present it ' frotn a standpoint in consonance with his own experi- ence and observation. I quote from a part of his speech, which we had the honor of hearing. \ Fro1n the tilne I left 1ny legal alma 111ater,\ he said, \ I have become n1ore and more convinced that the course of true love never did run stnooth.'' We disappeared upon the conclusion of his discourse, but afterwards , learned that Harry had won distinction in the lecture field. On arnv1ng at the city of Indianapolis the first fan1iliar face that n1et our gaze was that of Colgan. He had grown so1newhat old since we first knew him. His fonn bore the 1narks of labor, yet there was the sa1ne stern look and earnest bearing countenance which characterized his school life. He informed us, upon inquiry, that his conscience would never sanction his following the profession of law, and n1oreover he had resolved never to betray the inclinations and genius of his race, so he went on the railroad, where he has been promoted second switchn1an on a side track leading frorn the suburbs of the city. Scarcely had we bid adieu to our friend Colgan until we were confronted by a large, portly-looking n1an with a bundle on his back. After several consec- utive g!ances it became quite evident that it was the face and forn1 of Sin1onds. He, was engaged in the very clan1orous yet exhilarating business of buying old rags. It is supposed that the idea of following this for a livelihood first entered his 1nind while at Albany-a city in the east rather noted for the superabundance of the trade. The secret of his success seemed to be the remarkable d~gree of vociferousness to which his voice had been cultured. From here we went into Arkansas, where we acci- ; dentally found Mudge hunting wild deer. Mudge is a 1 sportsn1an by profession, and is said to be a far better marksn1an than Bogardus, even in his palmiest days. Glass balls and pigeons are the unmerciful victims of his rifle. A full account of his most noted shots may be found in the last issue of Puck. Crossing over into Texas, we observed several wig- wams at a distance. Judging frorn the sound which ' ' • I
