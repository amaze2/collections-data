Considerable con1n1otion has been raised in Cleveland, 0., by an atten1 pt on the part of the faculty of Adelbert College to crowd out fe.male students and to prevent the ad- mission of others. The claim is tnade by An1herst that her gymnasium is second to ·none in the world. A regular course of gyn1nastic.:; is obligatory, and it is shown bv statistics that the health of Amherst stude~ts improves with each year of their course. The grading system at Princeton has un- dergone radical changes. By the new system each class will be divided into six groups, not allowing more than one-tenth of the en- tire class in the first group, and not mor'e than one-fifth in each remaining group. Yale has begun her one hundred and eighty-fourth year with a Freshman class of 219. The entering class is thus smaller than usual, but it is well supplied with athletes, as indicated by its recent victories in foot-ball over the Amherst and Wesleyan Fresh men. At Cornell the navy, foot-ball, base-ball and general athletic associations are to he consolidated under one general managernent, to be known as the Athletic Congress. The object is to secure a more economic use of the athletic funds. President White and several of the younger metnbers of the fac- ulty are said to have interested themselves in such a change. The different religious denominations con- tinue to show an increasing interest in colle- giate education. In the spring of '83 the 0, bring me a 1nap of the seat of war!
