.. 22 THE CON\CORDIENSIS. - · ~~()~ t.hat .the repo~t of the committe~ ~p- , . po1n~ed · to prov1de means for ra1s1ng ·~· funds for base ball has been ac.cepte.d, I a few words on the subject will not be ~ out of order. In the first place, the students in general acknowledge the fact that we are in need of funds; second, they sig- nify a willingness to help raise such funds ; and third, they receive with approval the scheme proposed by the com.mittee. Then the responsibility is assumed and the com- mittee is released from all person·al risk. rhat we regard the plan as a good one is not necessary to state, and that to produce, sue- . cessfully, such an entertainment as recom- mended, involves hard work, daily rehearsals, harmonious action and judicious management is not less evident. We feel confident, how- ever, that this can be accomplished if every student asked to participate responds cheer- fully and promptly.. As the com.mittee sug- gests, let separate managers be appointed for · gymnastics, the orchestra and the glee cluh; and let each department be prepared inde- pendent of the other. The atnount of train- ing necessary can hardly be over estimated. New organization and persistent practice are required on the part of the orchestra and glee club, and a selection of performers and a good deal of development on the part of gymnastics. Then let us \brace and let each man regard it an imperative duty to attend each and every rehearsal. Break off for once from the old Dorpian drowsiness which seems of late to have overpowered us, and let us show that there is some spirit on the \hill\ yet. Remember, that if the entertain- ment is successful onceJ it may be repeated at other places, and that failure by neglect will reflect heavily on the students and the college. Prof. Perkins was present at the supper given in honor of St. Clair McKelway at Al .. bany December 5· WrE are able to state that the ne·w gene- ~ ralcatalogue ofUnion, which has been ~ for some time expected, is finally out. I Such a catalogue was much needed, J none having been printed since 1868. The new issue includes the class of 1884. Prof. Lamoroux has had the work in charge. A large amount of _time and labor 1s required in the publication of such a cata-- logue. Lingering or irrelevant replies to letters of inquiry, and sometimes no replies at all, are among the annoyances that meet hin1 who assumes the forn1idable undertaking. Among the nan1es enrolled are many which . have becom.e widely known in our own, and other lands. The frontispiece is a view of the time-worn buildings, as seen from the city elevator. It includes the central bui1d- ing, Washburn Memorial Hall, and the green woods beyond. The price of the volume is $2.00. WrE notice that several of our exchanges ~ are discussing the feasibility of es- ·~ tablishing an intercollegiate oratorical ! association. 'fh at such a plan will J meet with the hearty s~pport of col- lege men in general there is not the lea~t doubt. We have contests for deciding the merits of the various colleges in base ball and other athletic sports, and there is no reason why an association for the purpose named could not be made of great value as well as of interest. We hope to see the plan receive the attention which it deserves. Yale students are excited over a change in the Christmas recess. Hereafter but two weeks wi11 be given for it and the week gained will bring Commencement earlier. This action is for the benefit of those who spend the sun1mer vacation in Europe. The average'age of the Fresh1nan class is slightly over nineteen years; the average weight is 134 pounds, and the height, five feet seven · and one-half inches .

I tackled the rings Where the gentle Fresh swings And took in the pa~allel bats, But in learning the '' dip\ My hand took a slip And I struck on the floor, seeing stars. I made not a halt, But tried the pole-vault, Although I did feel like a wreck; With one rnighty spring I soared o'er the string, And struck on the back of my neck! Nought dampened my ardor. I tried all the harder, To become, like my chun\, an athlete ; For he was a jumper, .A runner, a \thumper And at wrestling was good on his feet. I had a desire To be a \high-flyet· To turn somersaults from the board; I tried it one day, And as I litnped a way 'The fellows around me just roared.
