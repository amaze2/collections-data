It n1ay interest our readers to learn some- thing of the slang words and phrases used at other colleges. For research into this sub- ject 've are indebted to the Acta Colznnbiana which has published a series ot articles on it. vVe will mention the n1ost in1portant. The author-Richard Grant Black-says that at Cornell the word pony has a different n.1eaning fron1 that at 1no:t colleges, signify- ing crib or other unla \Vful aid at examinations or -rec1tations. .At Union, pony has both sig- nifications and is made to carry a good deal. A Union man rzdcs his porzy, or lzorse, in his room, rides it into class room and rz'des through, if he is not so unfortunate as to be unsaddled. At Willian1s and Bow·doin only, colleges have bootlegs. Sna.b is the n1ost common name for unmar- ried fen1ales, but is not used at Union. The more youthfi.d portion of the tender sex an1ong us-\ve n1ean in Schenectady-are re- ferred to as fair 1na£ds of Dorp, or quail.
