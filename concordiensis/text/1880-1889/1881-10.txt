2 THE CONCORDIENSTS. ~it.exary. CHILDHOOD. BY LUTHER JAMES EMERSON. Again I stretch me on the new mown hay, That give3 its frageance to the shade of elms ; I watch the shadowa on the moaatahB play, From freighted clouds that fill the airy realmB. I watch, as I was wont to when a boy, And he.:tr the hum of insect.::~ thro' the air ; I feel the thrill of that once thoughtle3d joy, Creep thro' my life to make its lodging there. And yet, how changed; forthatsweetjoythatlatl.ghed With innocence, and sang its random glee, _ lVIakes harsher tones, as if itd life were daft With something coaraer than it used to be. Alas .! am I no longer that free child rrhat lay upon my elbows and my hips, And dreamed till in the mystic dream I smiled . And pressed the honeyed clover to my lips? Why is it, that I cannot wholly feel That simple love; and why does time estrange 1\Ie from my youth; and why do shadows steal Across my life with such a fitful change? I try to think that I am but the youth, Upon whose cheeks the summer zephyrs played; And say. against my older self and truth, That boyhood and ito fancieo3 do not fade. Bnt ah ! the chirping crickets ·in the grass Pipe sadder melody unto my ears ; And cawing crows that o'er the ledgea pass, l\Iake hoart:~er sounds than in my early years. Tell me, 0 restless heart ! and break the spell That weaves the.3e phantom fancie.s on the brain; Are these the unsnbatantial dream.s that dwell · In man, or do I meet with truth again? E'en so, my tongue hath lost the simple art To make the long stemmed dandelions curl ; And tho.3e brown eye,, that looked into my h~?art- 0, where are they ;-and Amy, that fair girl? A bonnie lass she was, with golden hair ; And oft the buttercups by yonder brook We culled, and while I wove them here with care, She read me pretty talea from au old book- Of belted knights, and Arthur, a great king ; And ancient castles with their gilded tow'rs ; And armor bright that once was wont to ring, Where wine and women filled delicious. hours. Which, when she read, my fancy seemed to rise For oft she dropt upon some silver rhyme · That danced upon her tongue and in her eyes, Till I was but a knight .of olden time. .. And once; ha, ka ! we played that ancient game Of knight and lady, parting by this tree ; . '· I kissed her l'Tt.by lips and breathed her name, While she did laugh aud clap her hands at me. Again, with bright-eyed daisies in my hands · · I read the fortunes of her futu~-e state ; _ How she shmtld tra. vel through all foreign lands., And be a lady with the good and great. She smiled bewitchingly, sweet. Amy did, To ·see my h-€lt and mimic swmd 1 of lath ; Bat when I sa:id: ''adieu,\ her face she hid, Nor could I kiss her running down the path. Once I had thought of love with g-lories rife, As is yon mountain dressed in ii ving green ; That I sh0lt1d waJk with her in fuller life, And realize the dream that once had been. Ah, well! I stood above her grave to-day·; Her epitaph is dimmed by wasting years, And lichens cling upon the marble gray, Where I have lately left my truest tears. The wind is rising and the shadows fly Across the luadland of the foamy lake ; And dark clouds thicken iu the northern sky, And I my meditative farewell take. UNION CoLLEGE, July 10, 1881. VOUNO.
