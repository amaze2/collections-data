38 THE CONCORD'lENSIS. LITERARY. THE RIVER. Go stand by the river-side, mark the wave rise Which the seaward-borne flood pushes up from its breast, Mark the chance-scattered foam as it too seawarcl flies, And the whole on ward water that never knows rest. Oh what says the river, lad? lass, what to thee Says the river so swift,. onward pressed ever- more? Give ear to its voice as it speeds to the sea, And fills the whole air with its wild-murmured lore. \Yea rend if ye will, ye steep channels of stone, '' Ye high frowning banks even yet closer bend! \ So long as n1.y purpose remains wholly one, '' The more harsh your oppression, the sooner its end.\ '' For sea ward ye force me! yea the freedom loved sea '' \Vill receive me at last from your harsh keep- ing hurled; '' And bear my tried waters eternally free \Far off from these trial::; to compass the world. ZOR. '83. A VINDICATION oF THE CusToM oF SALTING FRESHMEN. DEDICATED TO THE SOPHOMORE CLASS. Inasmuch as from time to time there appears in the·Sophomore class some would-be Reformer, who at- I sideration, I have applied myself to the study of the subject and have col- lected such infonpation as, I hope, will silence ignorant opposition and encourage faint-hearted Sophomores to persevere in their laudable en- deavors. The antiquity of the custon1 is in- dubitable. I am unable to state positively that it was practiced in the Academia and other colleges of Greece. It is, however, mentioned by Cicero and Terence as in use at Rome. When Terence talks of the \salem qui in te est,\ he gives the taunt of a Roman Soph. to the un- lucky recipient of the contents 0f his salt bag. Cicero says, \P. Scipio omnes sale facetiisque superabat,\ showing that Scipio the Sophomore was not less energetic against the Freshmen~ll Scipio Africanus against th .-arthaginians. Here we have the first step in the vindication,-the authority of nearly I two thousand ye~rs continuous prac- tice. I say continuous advisedly for though I have seen no 1n·ention of the custom up to 1647, the universal silence on the subject is a strong proof of its wide-spread existence. Had the custon1 not been generally known or had it died on t at any time there would have been many descrip- tacks the ancient and honorable ' tions for the benefit of the curious, as witness the fact that when the methods of training Freshmen, and custom was dying out at Oxford the particularly the custom under con- 1 literature of the period contains

THE CONCORDlENSIS. 39 numerous references and descriptions such as would naturally be expected from victims of a dying or dead cus- tom to an ·age which knew it not. The fact that the custom died out at Oxford does not break the continuity of the practice, for when Harvard was founded the custon1 was in full force at Oxford, and most probably the custom was derived from Eng- land and perpetuated in Am,erica by Harvard. The custo1n, then, is historical and used to be authoritative, though the present authorities of our Colleges, doubtless through total ignorance of the subject seem to discountenance it. Hear how ·it was practised at Oxford. I quote fron1 the life of Anthony A. Wood who matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, in 1647. \Shrove 'Tuesday, Feb. 15, the Fire being 1nade in the Common hall before 5 of the clock at night, the Fellowes would go to supper be- fore six, and making an end sooner than at other times, they left the Hall to the L.ibertie of the U ndergraduats, but with an Admonition from one of the Fellowes (who was the Principall of the U ndergraduats and Postmas- ters) that all things should be carried on in good order. While they were at supper in the Hall, the Cook (Will N able) was .making the lesser of the brass Pots full of Cawdle at the Freshmen's charge ; which after the Hall was free from the Fellowes was brought up and set before the Fire in said HalL Afterwards every Fresh-rnan, according to Seniority, was to pluck off his Gawne and Band and, if possible, to make himselflook like a Scoundrell. 1~his done they were conducted each after the other to the high Table, and there made to stand on a Forme placed thereon ; from whence they were to speak their Speech with an audible voice to the Company; which if well done the person that spoke it \vas to have a Cup ofCawdleand no salted Drinke; if indifferently, some Cawdle and some salted Drinke; but if dull, nothing was given to him but salted D'ri1tke, or salt put in College Bere, with Tucks-tE- to boot. Afterwards when they were to be admitted into the Fraternity, the Senior Cook was to administer an oath to them over an old Shoe, part of which runs thus: Item tu jztrabis, quod penrtiless bencht nottvisitabis, &c.; the rest is forgotten and none there are now that remem- 1 ber it. After which spoken with gravity the Freshman kist the Shoe, put on his Gowne and Band, and took his place among the Seniors.\ I have established beyond doubt * Tuck, that is '' set the nail of their thumb to their chin just under the Lipp, and by the help of their other fingers tmder the chin, they w Juld give him a chuck, which sometimes would produce Blood.\ The thum.b nail was kept long for this purpose. t Penniless bencb, a seat for loungers.

The custom should have the sanction of the College au- thorities. Their oppositi~n to it has some ground while it is practised in Chapel, but I venture to suggest 1 that by providing a '~common hall,'' this objection would be re1noved. Again, the custom is symbolical. In fact it is said to symbolize so many things that it i~s difficult to determine 1 what it really means. For instance, it is said to be the perpetuation of a pagan rite. Again, \as salt draws up all that matter that tends to pu- trefaction, so it is a symbol of our doing the like in a spiritual state, by taking away all natural corruption.\ I Again, \why may it not denote that wit and knowledge by which boys I dedicated to learning oug-ht to dis- tinguish themselves?'' Tradition, . however, makes it the symbol of the change from the verdant Fresh man to the experienced n1an, just as beef is changed and preserved by salting. Here, then, is a custom that is his- torical ; that has been until lately I sanctioned by the powers that be ; I that is symbolical with a very mean- ing symbol. It has been attacked by those who are bound to uphold it. It is opposed by those who ought to allow it. Sophon1ores, rally to the defense of your privileges. If you give an inch, an ell will be taken. If you stop saltin .s> soon you \vill not be allowed to put Freshmen under the be cut oft. You will have no one to milk the cows for you.

The standard ofgood conduct has been steadily on the in- crease. May we, as many a Thanksgiving returns, ever find some improvement in the fortunes of our Alma Mater! I , We would like to give a piece of : I advice to the students the pertinence ! of which they must admit after a rnoment's consideration. Theyshould patronize those who advertis.:: in the ' CONCORDIENSIS. Most of them know that the paper barely pays for itself and rarely does the balance prepon- derate in our favor at the end of the year. We have no desire to make money. It is our aim to furnish to the students a college monthly which will compare well with other college papers. So long as we compass that object we care only that the credit and debit colun1ns should be equal. 1\'o do this we are dependent on our advertisers. We cannot, ho\vever, ask men to advertise who will re- ceive no benefit from so doing. There- fore we ask the students to patronize those who patronize us. The men, whose names are found in our adver- tising colun1ns, are honorable busi- ness men, and the students can trade as well, if not better, with them than with those whose closeness prevents them from supporting us. The men who advertise desire the students' trade, and will deal fairly to retain it; while we may suppose that those who desire to save a penny by not advertising, \Vill save one at the cus- tom.er's expense-, if the opportunity offers. The Seniors at their last class- meeting determined to get np a series of musical and literary entertain- ments for the purpose of raising funds for defraying their com.mencement expenses. We think the scheme is an exceedingly good one for both the Seniors and those who will patronize thetn. It will help the former to solve the problem so serious to many -how shall we bear ourheavygradu- ati ng expenses ? Those of them moreover who will take an a~tive part, \Vill get excellent practice in many ways. To those who attend the entertainments, they will, we are sure, b~ very improving, and afford much amusement. rfhe plans have not yet teen n1atureci, but we pre- sume the boys will take the principal part in the exercises. The pr.ofes- s·ors, too, \Ve hope, will cheerfully aid by readings and lectures. There is no reason why these per- formances should not be eminently successful. They are by no means an untried enterprize. At Amherst, last year, the Seniors by a similar attempt paid off a large debt and had some funds over. 'At the North- western University these Senior class entertainments are grand affairs, and for thern are engaged many stage

On their progta1n_ for this year there are the Litta Concert Company, · Josh Billings, the well known reader Burbanks, and others. 1'he Lecture Association of the U ni- versity of Michigan appear to get up their entertainments on even a grander scale, and have engaged the Litta and Kellogg Concert Compan- ies, Miss Cary, the Boston Tetnple Quartette, etc. These last named Associations appropriate their re- ceipts to the support of library read- ing-rooms and the gymnasium fund. In our last we advocated changes in the college course in regard to our training in writing and oratory. Most of the steps in such changes can not, of course, be taken immedi- ately, and these in1provements must be accomplished by degrees. But a great ad vance in one direction can even now be attempted with no trouble at all. The boys ought to have a regular room in which to practice elocution. No one wants to 1nake himself an object of curiosity to the whole section by yelling and stan1ping in his own room ; and the halls of the literary societies are too cold for the purpose. Now if the Senate chamber could be appropri- ated to this cause every afternoon except :Friday, it would be the very place. With all our debaters, sena- tors, chapel orators, declaimers, prize-stage men, etc., the room ought to be occupied every day. In order that each of the Seniors may be able to have photographs of the whole class, a committee has been appointed to make arrange- ments \Vith some first-class photo- grapher who will come to Schenec- tady and take negatives of all the Professors and members of the class. The sitting costs nothing, and each man can order as n1any as he may desire, and will be abl .. e to procure a picture of each of his classmates. In former years delays and mistakes have occ11rred to such an extent that Commencement with its separations comes before all the pictures are taken ; but this, with this new arrangn1ent, will be entirely obviated. It has atso been proposed ·by the Senior class to charge admission to th~ Commencement ball. This also is a ne\v departure and an exceedingly good one. The price of tickets will be such as to lighten the Commence- ment expenses, and it will also avoid making the ball a place where any one wbo chooses may have a jolly time free of expense. Both of these changes are good ones, and now if some arrangen1ent can be made, or some agreement entered into, so that for ten years to come every man in the class can be able to tell the whereabouts of every other man, we shall think that Eighty-two has made changes that it will be well for future classes to pattern after.

CoNCORDIENSIS.) MESSRS. EDITORS OF CONCORDJENSIS: I hear the Garnet of '82 being already discussed and wish to put in a \vord. We have many institutions in College which the boys support, not because they take a special in- terest in them, but merely because they are college institutions. The most prominent, perhaps, is the Gar- 1tet. There is, I thi~k, a large n1a- jority of the b8ys wh(), if the G!lr/z.:t should be published, will cheerfully take a copy, but who would n1uch prefer that it should never appear: How much is there in the book to interest the boys ? There are the lists of the classes and different socie- ties-very good for refer~nce, four . tedious editorials that few care to read, a page or so of\ ra1ns \ that are rafher amusing, a few sickly-looking wood-cuts that are eagerly pored · over by those ·who love to work out puzzles, and finally, page after page of eating clubs, whist clubs, boating associations, orchestras, quartettes, etc., etc., that exist only intheminds of the editors, and are only a mass of names to tickle those who love to see themselves in prin:t. I was an editor myself on the last,and did not take enough interest in it to read the editorial of my own class for months after the book was out. Just here I can hear some exclaitn? \ \Vhat, drop the Gar:n d and be laughed at by every other College which has its annual publication!'.' Well, if it affords them any amuse- ments, they are welcome. We should seek our own .good and not the admiration of others. . But there is one part of the Gar- net which is of practical importance, and which we should retain, and that is the lists of the classes, societies and all organizations which are of general interest. I lately sa·w what took\the place of Garnet in '62 and It was a large sheet of stout aper with four pages, on which was p inted the lists of the Faculty, classe ., secret and literary societies, and prominent organizations.
