BURROWS, SCHENECTADY, N.Y. Commencement Exercises. Comtnrnencen1ent exercises began Sunday evening, June zo, with the baccalaureate ser- lnon, by the Rev. Dr. Onniston, of New York. 1'he sermon, charaB:eristic of Dr. Onniston, was plain, forcible and practical. At titnes, it seetned to the audience that the speaker was trying simply to atnuse thetn ; but the good Doctor had his point always in view, and 1nade his applicalions tnore than strong by his hutnor- ous satire. Monday afternoon, at three o'clock, the grove exercises were held, under the large ehn in Jackson's garden. About ten o'clock Monday tnorning, it was ascertained that both the Pipe Orator and the Ivy Orator were unable to be present at the exercises. For a time it looked as if there would be no progra1nn1e to carry out, but with that ability which Eighty-six possessed to carry out everything which they undertook the exercises were made a success. President Allen introduced W. P. Landon as Pipe Orator, and fro1n the fact that while only a few hours were given for preparation the oratot rather e'clipsed shnilar efforts of fonner classes, Mr. Landon is deserving of no little credit. H. J. Cole took the place of E. W. Courtright as Ivy Orator, and did honor to hi1nself and the class. E. E. Veeder read. a fine I~y Poe1n, which we print elsewhere. Music was furnished by Par- latti's orchestra. The class introduced two new features in the way of printed slips of college songs and a class song rendered by a quartette, consisting of Messrs. Culver, Foote, Voorhees and Randall. Class exercises were held Monday evening, at eight o'clock, at the First Reforn1ed church. President Allen gave the address of welcon1e and then introduced the 01~ator of the evening, Mr. D. B. Kinne, Jr. The oration was upon England's great statesn1an, Gladstone, and fully did justice to the subjeCt. The effort was a fine one, and the oration was pervaded throughout vvith the satne solid good sense which has always charaCterized hitn as a student. G. S. Dorwin read the class history, and kept the audience in good hu1nor and attention until he had finished. Following this catne the class poe1n by F. S. Randall. T. C. Lawler, with his charaCteristic origin- ality, 1nade a little departure fro1n the old tinle- worn 1nethod of procuring a prophecy. He neither consulted witches nor dreatned it-he si1nply prophesied. There were sotne close hits, but the prophecy while sharp and appli- cable was quite free from the tnean flings which often appear in such produCtions. E. S. C. Harris delivered the address in his old-titne,

THE CONCORDIENSIS. Class Oration-· Gladstone. Fifty years ago, when I was in the Foreign office, said Gladstone, in a recent speech. Fifty years in public life ! What changes have taken place in governtnent, in thought, and in tnen in that titne. In reviewing the work of a n1ctn who has been active during such a period, and \Vho has be- come and ren1ained the greatest leader of his titne against all opposition of crown and class, ~ve must expeCt to find inconsistencies. The words and deeds of one occasion never supply an effectual test of charaCter. We rnust consider a life as a whole, and relate the change of plan and purpose to the natural effect of growth and acco1nplishrnent. A tnan who is not willing or able to take a difterent view of great questions as he reaches a difierent stage of aCtion cannot keep abt·east of the ti1nes. Even if he have so1ne grand purpose to accotn- 1 I plish he will at best becon1e but an able 1 fanatic. He ~vill blindly follow one cour!)e, I now falling short, now striking avvay beyond; ! frequently defeating his own ends because of j the inopportuneness of his n1ove1nent. I If, on the other hand, he be content ·with cotnfort- ! 1 able conten1plation of the glories of his grand- , fathers, he will becon1e a conservative, opposed to 1 all change all progress. Because this or that ! tnethod has served a certain purpose and afforded a degree of prosperity in the past, he will say ''Let there be no change.\ fie fcarse\·ery step ahead lest it bring disruption or violent revolution. · He lives in and on the past and is blind to the fac1 that tin1e tnakes changes. Gladstone is alike ren1oved fron1 both these classes, and yet cotnbines certain features of both. His pron1inence to-day is due to his ahilitv to abandon old positions and establish hin1s~lf in new ones, so frtr in advance that retreat is itnpossible or unnecessary, and at the saJue tin1e he is a conservative in refonn. J-Iis plans are not ~vild and visionary but essentially practical and adapted to the titne aud occasi<~n. We find hitn at one tin1e the defender ot the Church in Ireland, and again the successful chmnpion of disestablishtnent. Now a con- servative of pronounced type and later a liberal of the liberals, going so far in advance of the ideas and cotn prehens~ions of the ultra liberal leaders that they cry out in alarrn and disavow adherence to such radicalistn. Gladstone then does not owe his eminence to partisanship; party feeling demands the pros- tration of the reason and the will. It is as dog- matical and dan1natorv as the Athenasian creed. I It has the natTO\\-Tness of a se& and the exclu- siveness of a caste.\ The strict partisan must believe in the infallibility of his leaders and the rnortal errors of his opponents. He tnust defend his party when wrong and attack the opposite even \\-'hen right. But \Ve tnust not suppose that because Glad- stone has neither been the striCt adherent of a party nor the persistent advocate of doctrines that he once defended that he has not had a pur- pose in his career. For the past twenty years he has ever been the chan1pion of one cause, he has ever had in Yie~v one grand objeCt, natnelv, the elevation of the Irish people, the rio·btit~a of \\Tone-s of centuries duration. Fail- b 0 '-' ing in a tnensure to accotnplish all he desired, he has again and again been called by the Eng- lish people as the one tnan in the United l(ing- don1 able to n1akc plans for the peaceable and pern1anent settlen1ent oft he relations \\-'ith Ireland. lie educates the people and leads then1 step by step, advancing ever to broader plrtns and n1ore liberal policy. 1\s n1ore and 1nore progress is tnade in the n1arch he adapts· the policy of gov- enunent to the advance in position. I Ierein lies the tnain-spring of his life. This I charaCteristic fits hin1 to be a leader for so long a period. Round in hy the lines of party or blindly attaching hitnself to one and only one tnethod of solv·ing the problen1., one failure would haYe ended his career. But not so. His plans to-clay are in contradiction to those he fonned ten years ago. lie has been great enough to see that the exigencies of the case \Yarranted the change, and the adherence of n1illions of Englislunen attests thevvisdotn of his judgn1etlt. Blind infatuation say his enetnies. The n1ost unaccountable delusion in the annals

The words and deeds of one occa8ion never supply an effeClual test of charaCter.

I He lives in and on the past and is blind to the fac1 that tin1e makes changes·. Gladstone is alike removed fron1 both these classes, and yet cotnbines certain features of both. His pron1inence to-day is due to his abilitv to abandon old positions and establish hitns;lf in new ones, so far in advance that retreat is itnpossible or unnecessary, and at the sa 1 ne tin1e he is a conservative in refon11. His plans are not wild and visionary but essentially practical and adapted to the titne aud occasion. We find bitn at one t.itne the defender of the Church in Ireland, and again the successful chatnpion of disestablishn1ent. Now a con- servative of pronounced type and later a liberal .of the liberals, going so far in advance of the ideas and comprehensions of the ultra liberal leaders that they cry out in alann and disavo\-v adherence to such radicalistn. Gladstone then does not owe his etninence to partisanship; party feeling demands the pros- tration of the reason and the will. It is as dog- :tnatical and da n1natory as the Athenasian creed. It has the narrovvness of a seCt and the exclu- ·siveness of a caste.\ 'I'he strict partisan must believe in the infallibility of his leaders and the n1ortal errors of his opponents. He tnust defend his party when wrong and attack the opposite even when right. But we 111ust not suppose that because Glad- stone has neither been the strict adherent of a party nor the persistent advocate of doctrines that he once defended that he has not bad a pur- pose in hi~ career. For the past tvventy years he has ever been the chan1pion of one cause, he has ever had in view one grand objeCt:., natnelv, the elevation of the Irish people, the righti\t;g of vv-rongs of centuries duration. Fail- ing in a tneasure to accon1plish all he desired, he has again ancl again been called by the Eng- lish people as the one n1an in the United King- dotn able to n1ake plans for the peaceable and penn anent settletnent of the relations with Ireland. 1 lie educates the people a_nd leads then1 step by I step, advancing ever to broader plans ·and n1ore i liberal policy. .A.s n1ore and tnore progress is I tnade in the n1arch he adapts· the policy of gov- 1 ernment to the advance in position. 1 flerein lies the tnain-spring of his life. This 1 charaCteristic fits hin1 to be a leader for so long I '\ a period. Bound in by the lines of party or , blindly attaching hin1self to one and only one \ tneth~cl of solving the problen1, one failure I \Vonld have ended his career. But not so. l\lis plans to-day are in contradiction to those he fonned ten years ago. l-Ie has been great enough to see that the exigencies of the case ·warranted the change, and the adherence of n1illions of English1nen attests thewisdo1n of his judg1nent.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. ---~---------- --- ~- -~ ---- -- -------------------- of history l But can this be? Can not the judgn1ent of the tnasses in the cout~se ofa gener.- ation be trusted? We think so. The English speaking people the world over think so. They say that he is a tnere rhetorician. Then rhetoric tnt1st tnean leadership, statestnanship, Glad- stone's success in life, his position ~t the head of progress and liberality in the world is due to himself. He has been not only unpopular with the Crown and aristocracy in general, but is positively disfavored and opposed by them. Nowhere in history can we find a greater ex- atnple of what a man can accotn plish. Gladstone's name needs no monutnent to be ren1ernbered. A scholar, an orator, a statestnan, he stands to-day without title, .preferring to be retnem he red as the great Cotnmoner. Great indeed has he been in the Cotnmons. Defeated in the Ministry, he returns to the Opposition Benches to the discotnfiture of his enemies. Defeated in his plans because too advanced, he returns only to adopt a policy .tnore liberal, more revolutionary, and comes nearer and nearer to success. By his marvellous power he cotnpels the Crown to dissolve Parliatnent and subtnit his policy to the people, and though his plans- for aiding Ireland ntay not succeed in his day, he will ever be retnembered as the advocate of right and the defender of the weak against the strong. To us now aCtually to start in life on our own resouTces, Gladstone's career affords an object: lesson of peculiar cogency. Our plans and views of life are not what. they were four years ago, and in four years titne they 1nust have changed again, or we shall be in a fair vvay to be left be- hind in life. Public thought on all questions changes with every year. To lead in the con- test, to keep a place even, we tnust be able to deteCt: the change in sentitnent, and instead of standing to wait for the wave to strike us we n111St 1neet and guide it. The titne has passed when the nan1e of a party or seCt: or creed can give a 1nan success. The world must progress, and if we are to lead in the march ofadvancetnent we In ust change before circtunstances. That which to-day ~eetns to be the best course tnay next year or the next p1·ove to be entirely in error. Look at the Idsh question fl·om the standpoint of an Irishman, said Glad stone, This means be liberal, be fair-tninded. A void fanaticistn, avoid senseless conserva- tistn. They are equally a waste of power. Be liberals of the liberals when necessary, be con- servative when conservatism means opposition to rashness. Then, with convictions founded on good judgtnent, have courage to stand for them, to :fight for thetn against any opposition, and success is assured. Ivy· Poem. ELMER E. VEEDER. (TOME classmates all and gather round \.:) Beneath these shady bowers, To while awqy in joy ancf mirth The short and fleeting hours. Ere now the bond that binds our heart~ For other scenes yearning, Is broken from the ''old gray walls,'' These sacred halls of learning. Bring forth the ancient Pipe of Peace, That relic old and rusty, And quaff the nectar from its bowl, With youthful lungs and lusty; And as the darkened clouds of smoke On airy wings are flown, So from our hearts, by friendship'~ breath, Let clouds of wreath be blown. The ivy from some distant vale We've hither brought to-day, Where, clinging to some lordly oak, I It held unbidden sway; And struck its tendrils, dark and strong, Deep in the oaken side, And winds that swept the forest boughR It bowed to, yet defied. But now the scene is changed about, The stately vine lies low, For the ruthless hand of Eighty-six Hath willed it should be so. The vine that once so proudly grew Lies sttuggling now with death, And roots that ne'er the sunlight knew Are parched by its heated breath. Yet not to die did we bring thee here From thy distant forest hotne, A better fate is in store, we hope,

THE CONCORDIENSIS. Since thou hast hithe,r come. With .spade and pick we'll deave the eq.rth At our Ahna Mater'.s side, And deep in the dark and fertile ground Thy roots again we'll hide. Thy branches ne'er again shall twine About the for ~st tree, We'll bind thee to these ''old gray waHs,\ Thou shalt no more be free; Until with hahits formed anew, With fibres stronger gro-wn,. Thy tendrils, used to soher things, Can pierce the heart ofstone. Here sheltered from the stormy. blast, And winter's frosty breatfu, Revived by the spring-time rains Which life brings out of death, Refreshed by the sparkling drops Of Heaven's pearly dew, And nourished by the sun~.mer sun Thy strength thou'l.t soon renew. Then as the years go rolli·ng by, And tempests thee befall, With new-born vigor in thy veins Thou wilt withstand them all; Th.r grasp upon these massive walls Shall take a finner hold, Each storm shall find t:hee more prepared, More resolute and bold. Classmates, in this sitnple story, Fr01n life of our ivy vine, Do you not without much effort See a semblance there to thine? Like it we have been transplanted From our homes and boyish glees, To this place where wisdom lingers, Learned to pierce her mysteries. In youth's davs we roamed with freedom ~ ~ Whereso'er we choose to go, Troubled not by dreams of wisdom, Wisdom's cares we did not kn()w. When those dreams came stealing o'er us Soon they took material form, And the cares that haunt their footsteps Chased away this childish morn. Laid aside mere childhood's pleasures, Study's cares came in theirstead, Into wisdom's boundless treasures Deep and deeper now we sped; Till from home and home's affections, Fro·m the scenes to youth 1no~t dear, Under wisdom's stern correction Life anew began we here. Helplessly we stood and wondered 'Mid the ta-unts and s.ne,ers oif '·' Sophs,'' Sham~e:fully we .flllnkedand blundered In reciting to the q Profs''; Tlll our hearts grew faint ana sickly, Like the ivy at our feet, Difficulties ca1ne so thickly They seemed more than we could meet. Overcome by toil, appalling, AU around us, one by one, Comrades from our ranks w~re falling, As each new term was begun. And of aH the class \\\-hich g:a;thered, And ga:ve pro1ni~es so br\ght, O:nly we who :here assemble Are vifl:orious. in the fight. During .four long years w~'ve struggled With ·our Latin and our Gr.e~k, Mathe·matics we have sm·uggled, Frendil and German we can speak. We ave versed in mental science, And in n:1orals we are pat, 'To Atheists we hid defiance, All the Profs. will tell you that. Ere the first bright rays of tnorn ing 'Tinged the eastern sky with red, From the belfry came the warning, We must leave our downy bed; 'Then our way to pray~rs we wended, With our eyes half filled with sleep, With the morning air was blended Well-the words we will not speak. }3ut now these irksome scenes are over, And our troubles are forgot, In the brightness of the future We cap see no darkened spot. As we leave these halls which treasure Such fond memories of the past, We recall with keenest plea~mre Scenes which time has buried fast. Now to wisdom's ways accorded, I:rt her paths we gladly tread, The 1~esh'aints she once afforded; We no longer feel nor dread. As tb~ vine, by careful training, Learns to cli1nb these walls of stone.

What shall he do? 1'he rnajority of n1en are absorbed in the n1ere act of living, and think, not of the future and its possibilities, but only of the pains and pleasures of the present.

They all teach hin1 the same lesson. \~ ou have ab.ility of sotne kind ; you tnay be able only to dig a ditch, or perhaps you can .penetrate the deepest tnysteries of the htunan soul; but, \Vhether you succeed or fail in your calling, you will be happy in your last days only in so far as you have done what you could to help your fellovv-men. HoV\rever diverse tuay be the lives of the nJ:en whotn he questions, yet in their advice to hi 111 there is unbroken agreernent. Deeply irnpressed by this unanitnity; he resolves not only to vvork hard during the period of preparation for his profession; but in active practice to labor less for the n1oney he receives than for self-itnprovetnent, that he rnay honor the calling that he has chosen: for not untillat in life do tnen who are guided by lofty aitns receive pay in tnoney for their early labors. While he is training in quiet obscurity for the race of life, he sees young 1nen passing by hin1, and, as they turn and cast tlpon him a jeering s1nile, he is ahnost goa{led into following aft&r~ thetn ; but they have started too soon, and even no\v before his eyes begin to totter and fall, exhausted by their pretnature efforts: sotne to rise no n1ore ; others to start again, and again to fall ; son1e £ew, however, though crestfallen, to strengthen \Yell their limbs by 1nany trials, and finally to endure the great strain ; but all are delayed by their untitnely ·haste. From these failures he becon1es the n1ore deterrnined that he will not be hasty; but, at tin1es, Y\rearied by his continuous toil \Vithout any apparent results, ahnost in despair, he doubts \vhether he has not made a fatal n1istake. While he falters he thinks of his God, of the stnal 1 space that he hi1nself occupies in this boundless uni~erse, and of the cotntnand of his Creator to so use his powers as to fulfill the end of his existence. Taking new courage, he plods on. Wrapped up in his pur- pose, he bends all his energies toward its accotn- plishtnent ; ant.l, as the tnagician's wand turned everything into gold, so all his experience con- tributes to\vard his educa1 ion. Study and reflec- tion are filling that arsenal, his brain, with an equipn1ent for future ad:ion. The period fot act: ion now begins.

He is not concerned about opportunities for carrying out his ideas ; an ·earnest, capable tn:an can rnake his own opportunities. He does not need to wait; he has his n1aterials on \\vhich his tools with which, and his purpose fof which to work ; but above all he has confidence in hi tn- self. His success is, assured ; and so is that of any other tnan who is willing to take just a litHe n1ore pains than his fellow-cotnpetitors. It is the legititnate resu1t of this silent, persistent: ' 1nighty. preparation. Here in the United States is such preparation the rarest, and therefore the most needed. In no other country do tnen so rapidly rise into pron1inence; attract attention for awhile ; and then, as soon as the fair hubbile ofappearances bursts, sink into obscurity. In no other country are young tnen so tetnpted to give up unretnunerative work for lucrative positions ; and in no other country are such high prizes of. both wealth and station held out to those who resist these ten1ptations, pass their early lives in hard study without reward, and do not begin public action until thoroughly pr·e- pared. Irr this tnonth of June all over our land are young tnen leaving the tender care of their Alrn.a Mater to battle -in this world, which is said to handle tnen so roughly. Sball we who have had the foundations for future aCtion finnly laid ere& super-struCtures of equal stability; or shall we build vast fabrics, that ·will for a tin1e present an imposing appearance; and then, yielding to the first strong wind, bestrew the ground with ruins.

Class Po:em. F. S. RANDALL. W HEN n. poet writes a poem-· One that everybody 1·eads-· - vVe may make the supposition He has everything he needs; That he has in mind a subjec9:, Knows just what he wants to say, That his muse when hidden help :hhn Will not, frightened, fly away. When a poor, fodo.rn class-poet, Just about commencement time, Sits him do\vn and in a frenzy Tries to write his little rhyme Do you think an inspiration Comes in that sore time of need? If you do you are mistaken, You've the wrong idea, jndeed. l-Ie's a poor, misguided mortal, And I'm half ashamed to say He's the very worst example Of all those who g0 astray. He's another would-be dreamer, And whenever he pursues That divine and fair inspirer Whom the poets call their r:nuse, He discovers to his sorrow She will not her flight defer- If she will not come unbidden He can never go to her. I have looked up all the poets, Studied Shakespeare, Burns and 1\tloore, Read through Scott and Pope and Dryden, Minor poets by the score, And I know by heart \The Raven,\ Can repeat with dear delight \ Hail Columbia,'' ''Yankee Doodle,\ ''Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night;'' I am very \vell acquainted Too, with Byron's wild, we1rd ''Dreatn,\ But I'm sure I can't discover Where a poet gets his theme. Should I write about the future- Make a few predk9:ions mild- ! would overstep tny limits And the Prophet would get wild. Should I turn glances backward And our history unfold I would then infring-e on Dorwin And he straightway would cry \hold.\ Should I write of the professors, Tell their jokes of great renown, All the Sophs would hollo \chestnuts\ And the Freshmen would ''come down.'' 95

THE CONCORDIENSIS. Over all these lhnitations I had pondeted long and late Till they lay 11pon rn.y spirit With a heavy leaden weight, Would my muse not come a.t11d help me? Must I fail then after a!ll? Would my Pegasus get weary In his winged course and faU? Thus I mused just at tl:le dosing Of a bright, warm sutnmer day, Sat and gazed across the landscape, Watched the sunset die away; Saw the sh21.dow in the valley Growing deep and deeper stil1, Saw fair Luna's slender crescent Just above the western hill. Soon o'er all the ancient city Night's dark mantle softly fell, And from out a neighboring belfry Rang the hour-recording belt Day was done-was dot1e forever- And as night stole softly on Carrre the thronging rc-colleclions Of the four years past and gone. How time looms up in the distance When we look ahead aRd see All the dim, uncertain future- Days that must unhappy be! How it shrinks almost to nothing When our glances back we cast O'er the well remembered pathway Of a bright and happy past! And our past? Ah! that is happy, For whate'er a student's lot He remembers only pleasure- All the sorrow is forgot. Who can tell what aspirations Filled our breasts when first we came As a class to Alma Mater? On her roll-call stands each name. May the truthful, stern recorder Lem?e a glaring blank-unless She may write, in glowing letters, Underneath each name ''Success!'' 0 my comrades! 0 ye members Of our O\Vn loved little band! Now we separate forever- And with hand clasped warm .in hand Pledge we all life-long remetnbrance Of our by-gone college days. May the memory that lingers Sti m ul atte in us the p1·aise Of our gray old Alma Mater, Whose respected name we bear, And whose spot1ess,. stainless honor Guard we with a zealous care. May the unity that kept us In the past, be ever bent In the cause of right and freedom, Until strength and life are spent! May the class in which we glory. And which leaves forever now,. Prove to be another laurel In Old Union's dassiC brow! History of Eighy-six. G. S. DORWIN. Class1nates, friends of Union and of' 86 :- When that most celebrated of Rotnan lawyers, Papinian,. was required by the Empe!or Cara- calla to rlefend the tnur.der which he had perpe- trated upon his brother, Geta, as Nero had been defended by the philosopher Seneca, · he answered : \ It is easier to perpetrate the tnur- del: of a brother than to defend it.\ And he paid with h~s life for the glory of his answer; · So it is easier to be elected historian than it is to record the events of the class. Not because there is nothing to record of '86, for what sub- ject tnore fit for eloquence than a class whose merits, undertakings and victories for four years have been lauded to the skies. And it is n1ade a much harder task when one's classtnates come around and flleasantly persuade you to accept a treat, then wtth an earnestness so typical of the whole class, sweetly remark: '' Please don't mention that little episode of Sophotnore year, because my girl will be in the audience and I would not have her know of it for the world.\ He gratefully presses tny hand as I assure him I will draw it as light as possible. But a history consists of facts, ·and to be co1nplete should necessarily contain all and nothing but such faCts. So classtnate you have placed tne upon a path ftotn which I cannot depart, and should I 1nen- • I tion things unpleasant, like Prof. Hoffman, my only plea is \ It is tny duty.\ Hence, as a duty to future ages, it is necessary to give a correCt chronicle of what has happened within the last four years.

THE :CONCORDIENSIS. 97 to forget, and others, happy ones, when re- counted to inexperienced -under-c:lass!tnen, are absorbed with such attention as assures their being incorporated in the rnythicai tales of\ 01d Union.\ On that pleasant Septetnher 1norning when first as a class we passed through the blue gate and silently stole around to chapel, s~ub­ jecred to the jeers of the Sophotnores,, there was sornething about those forty-five which impressed the other classes that ''Though in nurnber we were few, We would bear us bravely through, Eighty-six would he an honor To us all.'' Many Sophon1o1·e seats were vacant that tnorn- ing. We did not know why, and our courage rose very rapidly when T'utor ... A.nable 1nildly but finnly seated that Southern ten-or, who had that plea&ant little way of whispering frosh. in about four different keys at once. But alas!· How short that prayer was. How our hearts~ began to jun1p as a diabolical yell arose without,·; and as we were hustled through the door_ cri~es of '' salt thetn \ arose on all sides. Prex. Potter's white beaver seemed tnade purposely for a target. It was our savior. As he atternpted to quell the row, salt bags flew around his head like tnoths around a flatne. We longed for night to come down and· shelter us, but what awaited us we knew not. Union has a custon.1 bo\h-pieasant and unpleas- ant of what is known as '' setting-up.\ The pleasantness or unpleasantness depends upon which class you are a tnetn ber of. When night's sable goddess did stretch forth her leaden sceptre we found ourselves on the unpleasant side, and Freshtnen could be heard singing, dancing and tnaking speeches to '85 whenever there was a lull in the hubbub. When Cole boldly clitnbed the idol and delivered an oration to '8 5 in a clear and unwavering voice, we all thought that he vvas a courageous Freshtnan. The Sophs sneer- i ngly inforn1ed tts it was nothing n1ore than cheek. As a class we have been .a unit. Every event in which we have figured in these short four years there has not been one tnan who has said '' I will not follow the tna jority\ ; ~~ nd at Algebra crernation every n1an was in line. As the soletnn proces~~ion wended its way through this ancient burgh the valient Fletcher struck terr()r to the heart of tno1~e than one Sophotno1~e. We escaped the accustcnned shower of eggs. Totn Foote, with his usu<tl foresight, had discovered where they were hid.

Third tern1 was ushered in with the parade by which we dernonstrated our ability to wear tiles and swing canes. Freshtnan year soon passed away, carrying with it sotne of the pleasantest rne1nories of our course. One of the charaCteristics of great 1nen is the facility with which they adapt thetnselves to the titnes by changin.g principles. As Freshtnen we had suffered tnuch, and argued against such barbarous custot;ns. But as Sophotnores we inserted a new plank in our class platfonn, which read: ''Every dog has hi& day.\ Ours had cotne, and we flattered ourselves we initiated '87 in proper style.

At the salting Kinne becatne very excited. Not that it is usual with hitn, but he did, and the salt frotn his hand rained clown upon the Freshrnen. like an avalaache. Prof. Staley evidently be- lieved in tnoderation. He quickly had Bart by the shoulders, and in tnild tones of authority asked: ~·l..,.oung tnan, vvhat are y9ugoingto

Mingled with our con- servatism was a love of politics, and on that tnorning when we heard that the candidate or the peoples' party would address the citizens or Schenectady fron1 the rear of his car at ro o'clock, w by of course vve n1ust be there. But we recited to Prof. Wells at that hour. Should \Ve take the chance of getting excused, or should we bolt?

He explained the t?ast the next tnerning in chapeL H~yes was sick for SO:JTI:e titne after and lived on clan:J. soup. We hctd a Junior hall,. Pratt had prophesied great ·success. We were sure we had spent eno11gh onan~angetnents. So was the class when it was assessed $132 to tnake up the deficit. Lawler sa.i,d l1e believed in the adage that '• those who danced tnust pay the fiddler,\ but in· his case ~t see1ned a base rnockery. Junior year we had red a happy existence, and we thought Senior year was to follow on. But alas! what an_ en·or. Hickok's principle that '' A rational being should obey reason ''' has troubled our drea1ns. We learned fully that '' A govern1nent is of thv people, for the people and by the people.'' We can1e to the conclusion that Kant, Spencer, Spinoza, Hurne, and a tnul- titude of others, only concocted thejr diabolical theoi·ies for O.~~IT especial discotnfort. We longed to believe know ledge a tnere phantastnagoria, and as Sheakspear has said- \ We are the stuff As dreanns are rnacfe of, and our little life Is rounded in slee;p. '' Fisher's \Principles of Theistn\ has probably ca.Jled forth tnore pure Theistn than was origin- ally intended. But those trials are past. In athletics '86 has always taken the lead. Every year she has taken a tnajority of all field-day n1:edals, and LandoR adorns his manly fonn with n1edals for b ei 11g the best college vaulter in the State. Titne forbids us to recount the victories ' of the nine. I will not enter into individual history, but will pass over how Ostrander always told u~ just before recitation that he had not looked at the subject, and try and n1ake us believe he had been bad the night before, when he had polled till the S111all hours. Neither will I say anythi·t1g concerning Skinner's msthetic knickerbockers., nor of the degree of excellency which IIarris h<lS attained as a wire-puller, nor the fatt that for four _years Randall has posed as a ghost, a rni.dnight 1narauder.

Ln one particular the class of '86, I think, is cliffer·.ent fron1 allorn1ost college .classes,, different in a respect which shows the honorable principfes of 1\11. y brothers. Other historians have stood he-:re: and apologized for the crushed and bleeding hearts which their bewitching dassn1ates ha\'Ve iett behiqd, and for the vows of , everlasting fidelity that end wHh a sweet, sad farewell. Don ..

I have investigated the tnatter thoroughly and find every rnan still retains his a\owed detenn ination of bachelor- hood. It tna.r. he that such detennination was frotn ca1.1ses detritnental to the rnen thetnselves.

JY1any changes have taken place in faculty (.luring our course.

Although death has not thi nnecl our ranks~ yet twice have we 1•een callecl upon to take a fin<ll leave of tnen to vvhon1 we had becotne devoted, and \\rhose nan1es will be held clear by '86 long after other things have been forgotten. Classn1ates, we have assetnbled to-night for the last tin1e in the charaCter of a class,-a joy- ful event, vvhich for four years vve have anxiously awaited. And yet our joy is tinged with sorrow as we look ir1to each fatn iliar face ; into the faces of those vve lo~re and respeCt as instrucrot s, into the faces of other classn1en., into the faces of those residents with whotn we have been pleas- antly associated, and remetnber that soon we tnust part. Four years of pleasant associations, sharing each others hardships, partaking of each others pleasures, have bound us with golden bands of friendship. Ali other associations are soon to be severed, vet titne and vicissitudes can- w • not erase fron1 the tablets of our 1ninds the joyful tnetnories of our college days. As we go forth frotn this, our once happy hon1e, to seek our lot in life's great struggle, to fulfill the ilnperious lavv of our being, tnay we always bear ourselves as worthy sons of so glorious an Aln1a Mater. Prophecy. T. C. LAWLER. The litnited ntunber of offices which the Senior class bestows on its deserving n1etnbers are eagerly sought hy tnany candidates. The class of '86 is no exception to this rule. For the various offices we have had rnany candidates. But there is one office which furnishes a striking exception to this rule, and that is the class prophet.

The Wells venerable professors, Foster, Pierson, and Whitehorne, have long since been laid at rest, but their nan1es are still held in grateful tnetTI<ory by those who had the benefit of their instJ~u&ions.

'86. ALLEN.-As to the class of '86, the prophet discovers that Allen fills the itnportant position of President of Vassar College. Report has it that the college never had a tnore popular president. ANGLE.-Ned. Angle studied law and very soon rose to a high position in that profession. Ned. was always sharp, and as a corporation lawyer he has few equals. CoLE.-· Cole has had many ups and downs since his college days, but by the aid of. his unlitnited side-face he always tnanaged :~' to bob up serenely.\ He is now a sewing rnachine agent.

FELTHOUSEN.-lt is with feelings of ptofound sorrow that the prophet is co1npelled to state that Felthousen went to the bad. Strong chink was the cause of it. He is now in an inebriate asylutn and is pronounced incurable. FooTE ANDW ooDBR:IDGE.-Foote and Wood- bridge tnade a specialty ofelecl:rical engineering, .and tnany and marvelous have been their iri.ven- tions. They are recognized as two of the n1ost protninent eleCtricians in the country. HARRis.-Edwin Schuyler Colfax Harris went into politics. He never was a candidate for any offi·ce, but it is an acknowledged faCt that he controlls the State conventions, and he is dreaded by all his political opponents. JAcKSON.-AHen Jackson was adtnittedto the bar shortly after graduating frotn college. He has risen steadily until now he occupies an enviable place 1 n the ranks of the legal fraternity. KrNNE.-The prophet would be loth to Telate anything but suGcess for D. Barton Kinne, Jr., and is pleased to find hi1n Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals of New l:\\ork State. He is a tnodel judge, and his decisions are recog- nized as being the soun.dest and ablest of any judge on the bench. LANDON.-Pe1·baps the 1-nost painful task which the proplH!t has undertaken is to relate the circumstances that led to the downfall of Willian1 P. Landon. During his college course it was always understood that he '\vas to ... study for the tninistry, and it was conceded by all that that was his vocation.
