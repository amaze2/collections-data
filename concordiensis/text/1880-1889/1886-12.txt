VOL. X. UNION COLLEGE, DECEMBER 20, 1886. No.3· \The Blue Gate.\ M ET RINKS I see throug·h that old g·ate .A long procession slowly pour; Within its ranlrs are students young, Professors bowed with ag~e and hoar. From hence to battle with the world, In linked armor study-wrought, They go to champion the truth, To be the pioneers of thought. Well nigh a century has passed . Since from these halls the march began; The gates of immo1·tality Are closing fast upon the van. And let us hope as in the past So onward through all future days, Youths treadinl! wisdom's pleasant paths May throng this gate with grateful praise. Our gracious Alma Mater seems To stretch ber hands at this old gate In welcome to the entering youth, In blessing o'er the g·raduate. .· Chester Alan Arthur. ~4ESTER ALAN ARTHUR, twenty-first f't_; _[]president of the United States, was born in Franklin County, Vermont, on Oct@ber 5th, 1830. His father, who was of Scotch-Irish parentage, came to this country, when eighteen years o£ age. He was a Baptist minister. Chester was o11e o£ a £amily of eight chil- dren, all but one o£ \Vhom survive him. He began his studies in preparation for College at Greenwich, N. Y., and completed them at the grammar school on Yates street, in this city. Entering Union College at fifteen years of age, he at once took high rank in his class. But his family was poor, as his father although a man of ability received but a meagre salary, and so in his Sophomore year Arthur was forced to leave College to teach .school in order to earn money that he might continue his education. He taught the village school at Schaghticoke, Rensselaer County, for $15 per month and \boarded around.\ Again in his Senior year he taught school in the sa1ne place. He was graduated in 1848, and despite the fact that he had been out of College so much during his course, he still took high standing in his class. He was elected a member of the Phi Beta Kappa society, an honor which was conferred upon six o£ those who stood highest in his class which at graduation numbered one hundred. 0vhile at College, he occupied number six, North Section, South College, where his name may now be found carved in several places. The present Union School building on College street, was then occupied by the Freshmen and Sopho1nores and was known as West College. Arthur's name deeply cut in one of the old stone window sills, still bears testimony to his industry and enter- prise. ) He was a me1nber o£ the Psi Upsilon Society and was elected President of that Fraternity at its annual convention held in New York city in 1885. After graduation he began the study of law at the Ballston Law School. While continu- ing his law studies he obtained the Principal- ship o£ an Academy at North Pownal, V t., the same school which was taught the very next winter by James A. Garfield. Thus were brought together in their youth, while struggling for an education, two men who were destined to be associated in the highest honors which this Nation can confer. In 1851, Arthur went to New York city,

The machinery by Republic, who, having succeeded to the Pres- which New York state furnished one-fifth o£ idency, did not most sadly disappoint those the men in the entire Union army was created by whom he was elected. It may be true by General Arthur. He often expressed a that all those who attain the Presidency by desire to enter the army and see actual ser- inheritance encounter disadvantages and di£- vice, but Governor Morgan and. others dis- ficulties which do not meet those who are ,., suaded him £rom such a courBe as they ·were regula;rly elected thereto; this certainly was convinced that he was doing his country the case with Arthur. He fell heir to the. more efficient service by raising t1·oops at office in the midst of a bitter fight o£ factions, home than he could possibly do at the front. Garfield's policy had not yet become clearly \i friend in speaking o£ his dealings with defined. Apart £1·om his war services he had the State Governmeht, said: \He was so not as yet held any very important office, jealous of his integrity that I have known under these circumstances we could scarcely instances where he could have made expect him to succeed. .But in this trying thousands of dollars legitimately, and yet position he displayed in a marked degree that refused to do it, on the ground that he was a crowning American characteristic, . the power public ~rvant and m~ant to be \above sus- to meet unforseen exigencies, and the non- picion. \) pa~tisan fidelity with which he discharged In 1871, President Grant appointed him this high trust challenged the hearty approval Collector of the Port o:f New York, this office of all parties.

But in the had justly won) former Greek has been only recently dropped as an experiment, and the action has received much adverse criticism from scholars all over the country; and in the case of the latter we find an institution which was, like Union, a pioneer, in adopting a full Scientific Course and was compelled to confer the degree A. B. for lack of another. Should the Scientifics Receive B. S. ? . TH_E Facul~ have had ~nder consideration the q uest1on whether 1t would not be bet- · ter for the graduates from the Scientific • Course to receive the degree of B. S. instead of that of .A.. B. which is now given. It is greatly to be hoped that the change . . Whatever question may be raised about will be made and that a classification which our Scientific Course being different from that Course in other institutions is at once is at once more general, more truthful and set at rest by a comparison of the studies, more exact will be employed. A degree to and methods. They are in many cases iden- be valuable should have some significance, it should indicate what course of work has tical, and throughout the resemblance is strong enough to clearly place them under been required for its attainment. And how the same head. is a degree to acq uil:e this significance unless it be. given :for like courses by . the different Colleges throughout the country? An insti- tution which refuses to follow. the general practice acts the part of a confusing element. This is precisely what Union is now doing. An examination of twenty-six College Cat- alogues reve.~ls the following facts: Eighteen have Scientific Courses almost identical with ours and confer B. S. ; one has a Latin Scien- tific Course with the degree B. L.; two have Scientific Courses with the ~degree Ph. D.; three have only a Classical Course and hence give only A. B~ ; and three (Harvard, Johns Hopkins, 2,nd University o£ Alabama) confer A. B. for a course which does not contain Greek. Thus twenty-three out of the twenty- six make Greek the essential study leading to A. B. .A.mong these Colleges may be mentioned-Yale, Princeton, HobaTt, Williams, The above shows clearly that it is the gen- eral practice among American Colleges to confer A. B .. for a course containing Greek, · and to confer B. S. for a Scientific Course. Shall we conform to it? That is the q ues- · tion. SciENTIFIC. Oh!

... . THE CONCORDIENSIS. 33 THE LIBRARY AND THE LITERARY SOCIETIES. BY the plan proposed below, it is believed · that the literary societies can make their meetings more interesting, useful, and more likely to be attractive to outsiders or mem- bers, who are not in the habit of attending. At present but few· men prepare themselves properly £or their debates and consequently do not do justice to the' subject, themselves or the society. The societies give evidence of attempting to revive and to return to the active and pros-, perous state that once characterized them and the only sure method of doing this is to make · their meetings active and interesting. By assigning live topics of the day as sub- jects and by insisting upon proper prepara- tion for debates this object can be accom- plished . and the literary societies made a valuable part of the college course. Now the plan· proposed is thi~ Let the officer, whose duty it is to assign the subjects for debates et cetera, consult the current num- bers of the 1·eviews at the library and from them select, with the aid of the librarian such subjects as are of present importance and which can be covered by lists of references, bearing directly on the subject, contained in the library. It is difficult to obtain any valuable references on somp subjects as vague and indefinite as have recently been assigned but by this plan any trouble of this nature may be avoided. The reference lists, o:f articles treating directly on the subject in question, will be furnished at the library and can be bulletined at the same time the subject is posted. It will _then be an easy matter to prepare a pointed, substantial debate which shall contain points interesting and instructive to the society. HEATING OF THE MAIN ROOM. S INCE the last issue, the tern perature o£ . the main room has remained steadily at a point which would freeze water and has been totally unfit for use by students. The : capacity o£ the places prepared £or their use in reading is not nearly sufficient and is a cause of discomfort to persons consulting the library. As was said in the last number, the only permanent remedy is the heating of the main room. This alone will provide for the gt·owing demand upon, and use of, the library and will at the same time remove a large reservoir of cold £rom the centre of the building. A practical plumber states that the boiler capacity and grou:hd pipes already in. place, are amply sufficient and that the prob- able cost of fitting with raidiators and pipes ready for heating will be only between $300 and $400. Surely this amount o£ money could hardly be better invested than in making useful and accessable one of the principle resources of the college and one that is rapidly coming into greater demand. MISSING BOOKS. THERE is scarcely a room in college that does not contain some books belong- ing to the libraries o£ the literary societies. Such books are not charged and were taken out before the libraries came into the charge of the College. Postals have been sent noti- fying all who have books charged to them but these uncharged books can be returned only by the courtesy of the students. Those · who have any books in their rooms belonging to either o£ the literary societies will, there- fore, return them at once to the College library. COMMUNICATIONS. 1.11 R. EDITOR: In the last number of the lY.l Concordiens1's the present arrangement of the Library was, alluded to, but left an open question. The question before us is, whether it is desirable that the students should be allowed to take the books to their rooms; or whether

!~ I THE CONCORDIENSIS. IT seems peculiar that the students do not take more advantage o£ the opportunities offered them for training and exercise in the gymnasium. With an instructor who is not only proficient in his line, but also more than willing to instruct ; ther~ is no excuse for · men neglecting an opportunity for beneficial · exercise. Our gymnasium contains good · material for practice, and the trustees seem . to be willing to better it i£ necessary, but the · students do not make enough use of what is there, to call for any addition. Twice a year the athletic pTopensities of the students crop out, before the Spring and Fall meets; in the interim there is no athletic spirit and no endeavor to keep in training or improve in the various sports. This term the candidates for the 'Varsity nine have not appeared, in the gymnasium and everything looks as though the Athletic part o£ Union College had passed away. This should not be the case, we wish to hold a place in the inter- collegiate athletic sports; let us prepare our- selves to contest £or it, we wish to take a · standing in the inter-collegiate base ball league; ·why not get in training? Some time · ago it was proposed to have a \Ladies' Day\ on which occasion the athletes could enter- tain their £air friends with exhibitions of skill in the gymnasium. This is a good custom to inaugurate and would help to ''boom\ the athletic spirit. The students o£ other colleges take a great interest in athletics, and we hear of the good records made and o£ the records broken, but none are heard of £rom Union. We are talking o£ an entertainment for the Athletic and Base Ball interest, why not have some Athletic and Base Ball interest to have an entertainment £or, and interests worthy of the College ? There is no reason in sending men to represent us to inter-collegiate con- test, merely £or the sake o£ representation. Let us have athletes who can represent us by taking the lead in such contests, and let us regain our former place in both athletics and base ball, by taking advantage o£ our opportunities in Winter and being prepared to make a showing in the Spring.

O NOE on a time when all the world was young, · There was n peasant pye, whose apple heignt:- Rightcheerfulto the eye {as to the tongue) A da.in ty morsel and a jolly si~·ht. For this Jackobus longed--a worthy wight- ·T:han whom some better do (no doubt) exist, Tho' few;surpass him when it comes to heiu~ht, Au.d he the pye desired to take in's fist To make it for his maw a good &nd g·allant grist. Now unbeknownst to him bis cousins came And in a basket placed the gallant pye, .And bade, as partner in their little game On.eGulielmus, {who was ever nigh); Then they Jackobus called and asked him why, He would not forth with them upon the deep, (Whel'e Mohawk's waters rage with quivering cry,) To spn:n its shallows, o'er its depths to creep, And -with them all that day high holiday to lieep. Now see them in their little frigates safe, Spu.rn all the dangers of the roaring sea, Whicll 'neath thdr bows doth whirling rub and chafe, A.ndtoss its foam ns hig·h as well may be Now mustJackobussore against his gore, A.nd Gulielmus, hurl them from their craft Into the wave which rises above the knee, And haul by hand the slowly following raft Wl.i'le aH the rapids foam Hnd hurtle rocks abast. M an-while the ladies sit them in tho t-llips, Like Cleopatra fanned by flying loves, The \vhile their knights within the rushing rifs Drag· on theh· chariots like to Venus' doves: Each pulls. his boat along (or sometimes shoves) And wades triumphant in the wallowing wave, Yet soon they r('aeh the shore and bank above, And from the deep their gentle ladies save, Then loudly they the rest and soft refreshment crave. N ()W Gulielrnus turns his mind to milk, And cups to drink from ; so away he goes, The otlurs sp1ead their couches soft as silk And rest them, weary with their watery woes. Thus for a while, till as one might suppose For food they 'g-in at once to fiercely burn, And their deshe with no small quickness grows. Till sllQrtly Gulielmus doth return, Bf'ariug three cups, a pa~l and eke a milk-fill d urn. So on the grass plot now the feast is spread, And ranged, full fair before their longing eyes: Egg·s wt-re there there, and butter too and bread And peaches also of almighty size, But in the midst Jookobus now descries The nmch desired and darling apple PY<', Of allllis labors great the well-earned prize~ He 'rie-ws it for a time with glittering eye, Then fell's upon it with a loud and cheerful cry. Each had a quarter. To the pye they gavP, No quarter. Each his parted portion had And being· four, they found they could not save A sin ~'le morsel from their mouthings mad, So wben with food they'd made their senses glad To tr:1.v·e1 home they shortly did agree, And to return the cup Jaclwbus bade.

The New York Tribune of December 4,. had the following: An enthusiastic meeting of the Alumni of Union College who li-ve in New York, was held last night at the house of Judge Van Vorst, No. 30 East Bixty-eighth street.

Landon, a son of Judge Landon, acting president of the College, who was graduated last year and is devoting lllUCh time and energy to the stimulating of public interest in Union college, with a view to adding to its endowment and usefulness. Among those present were Senator Miller, the Rev. Dr; George .Lt\.lexander, W. H. McElroy, Dr. Daniel Stimson, Mr. Scribner, John L. Hill, John V. L. Pruyn, of Albany, and Silas Brownell, who is also a trustee of the College.

Senator Miller called the meeting to order and invited Mr. Landon to unfold his plan, which consisted, briefly, of proposals to establish by subscriptions from Alumni and friends, a fund, the interest of which shOllld be de- voted to such uses as the majority of the subscribers should decide, while the capital should be regarded as an actual gift to the College. He stated that while Union College was no longer abreast with the great Colleges of the land, and while her course of studies was less wide and allowed less election on the part of the students, her friends thought that her discipline and methods of instruction were second to none. For years the College has suffered from lack of funds. Union has about 35,000 Alumni, and perhaps 2,500 of them are fairly well-to-do ; many of them have obtained wealth and distinction. She possesses real estate at Hunter's Point which in the course of time will make her wealthy, but in the meantime it is felt that some- thing must be done. The Senior class in Psychology, while engaged in the profound studyof mind, mat- ter and their relationships, were startled by . the professor suddenly jumping to his feet with the l'emark \Rats-I guess.\ C.

Bennett and McMillan. Union College the \cradle of Greek Letter }...,raternities\ has for the latest occupant of the infantile couch, the fraternity of Nu Sigma Gamma. The fraternity was founded in North College and is, from all accounts, in a very flourishing condition. The report that this society was a branch of the \White Cross League\ has been denied by a member of the society. Mr. Landon has met with encouragement whereV'er he has explained his idea, and in Albany, Troy- and Schenectady $7,000 have been subscribed. The meet- ing last night cordially approved the young man's plans. It was thought that $100,000 were not too much to expect and that the best use to which the fund could be devoted would be to pay the salary of a president for the College, after obtaining a distinguished man who would devote his life and energy to the work. Landon, '8 6, is doing a good work and every student. must wisb him success. The views of the Alumni on the use to which the fund should be devoted, will also he seconded by all, and we would add, get more professors, fill vacant chairs and let the present pro- fessors have less worlr, and be more confined to their specialties.
