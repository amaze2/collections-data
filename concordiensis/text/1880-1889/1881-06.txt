Llses, At least they have told it to me, That nlol'tals are smnetimes invested With wonderful powers to see. They tell me that smneho\'\v and son1ew l1ere, There's something, to others unknown, Possessed by the mystical n1uses And given to poets alone. Well})leasecl with a tale so clelightful, And happy that they should tell n1e, I made it my business and pleasure Quite often the muses to see. They seemed to be friendly and willing And 1nany a story they told, And spoke of this mystical something So often I soon became bold. One eve, when the sun was declining, And twilight was lovely and long, When biTds in the tree- to}JS were n1ating~ And sealing their love with a song ; I cautiously begged of the muses This gift to bestow upon me, . That I, with this magical vision, Smne wonderful picttue might see. I paused and awaited an answer, When suddenly day was as night; But soon it grew clearer and brighter, Till all the dark places were light. Ancl as it grew brighter and clearer, Ancl Nature put Silence to sleep, A picture of life and of action See111ed over my vision to sweep. E'en now I behold it before me- 'Tis strange that ~·on cannot see too, But surely you will in a 1noment, When. I have explained it to you- A beautiful, fond, aged n1other-· You see her? she sits on the hili- A happy young man is beside her .,.\waiting her bidding and will. A hmne, and the playthings of boyhood All scattered around on the floor, A mountain to climb, and beyond it An ocean of 1ilnitless shore. The picture is there, I can see it- The mother, the boy and the home, Life's mountain to clin1b to the summit Eternity's ocean unknown. ' The playthings are tattered and broken They re 1nostly a slate and some books, A lmtterecl tin horn and a--something- A \hobby\ -\horse\ judging from looks, A battle axe up in the corner, Two figures-an 8 and a 1, A hat an<.l a ball by the table, Antl under the bedstead a gun. The ho1ne is a garden of beauty, ~UlTounclecl with elms and -with pines, A scene for the foncl~st remen1 brance When life to its evening declines. ' The mother is silvered and wrinkled ' \V ell upwards a century old, Her clutnns are her children, her wisdom, Her worth let the ages unfold. And now as she sits in her roclcer • A tear like a pearl in each eye, One more of her many fond children She's bidding a loving good-bye. Her son by her side is impatient He longs in the world to be fr~e He's tired of books and of playthi~gs, A man and a hero he' cl he. He catches a glimpse of the mountain But thinks 'twill be nothing but fun: For all of the way to the bottom And half to the top he can run. That wrinkled old hand on his shoulder Lies heavy, he's anxious to go · He's. whirlin~ his ca:p on his fing~rs, H1s face w1th dehght is aglow. i . i . l t I

120 THE CONCORDIENSIS. At length the last word has been spoken, He turns to bid mother ·adieu, When suddenly, as in a moment, . The whole of the past is in view. He sees in the day that is ebbing, Is ebbing so swiftly away, With step like the noiReless to-morrow, With hopes of a lovelier day ; Re sees the emotions of pleasure That sparkle in every eye, And 'round them, like tendrils of ivy, . Are clinging his thoughts as they fly. He lililgers, he muses, he whispers, And softly I hear him to say:- '' When out in the world and the tumult, From home and the loved ones away, '' 0 h, then, I will miss the dear faces That greet me with welcoming cheer, Tho' oft I may linger to listen, I'll fail the old voices to hear. The trees will continue to blossom, The gTa~s will continue to grow, The birds will sing on in the tree-tops, The brook will continue to flow. '' The bell will ring on as it used to, Though rung by a different hand, The clock will still signal the hour, Eut summon a different band. The ball will rebound in the diamond, Though played by a different nine, The classes will 'tug' with each other The 'knot' to pull over the line. '' The cows will lie down in the p~tsture, The Freshmen will1nar their repose, The So1Jhs will exult o'er the tonic, As into the goblet it flows. The Juniors will boast of their leisure And dignity (only in name), The Seniors will seem to be learned, And picture a castle of fame. '' The 'Bah' and the cheer and the 'Hikah' Will follow the sport and the fun, But never with just the same echo As rang from the loud '81. The trees will grow tall on the campus, :But sure as their shadows increase, The memory of me will grow fainter, Until the faint throbbing shall cease. \New forms will bend o'er the table Where often I puzzled my brain ; New eyes will peer out of the window And brighten the glittering pane. My opposite's chair will be taken, My own will be vacant no more,. Who sat in the one or the other Will be but a question of yore. \ Ne~ flushes of joy and affection, New eyes full of fire and fun, Will glow as they meet on the sidewalk And sparkle as dew in the sun. New songs will be sung in the moonlight, New voices will vibrate the air, And sweetly arouse from their slumbers The aged, the young and the fair. '' All this I shall miss in the future, As n1emory shall tell it to me, And more shall I miss, for in memory There's more than the present can see. I'H miss the long walks in the valley In search of the first blooming flowe1· ; I'll miss, as the twilight declineth, The songs of the evening hour. '' I'll miss in my walks a companion, I'll miss from my chamber a chum,. I'll miss from the class-room a teacher Where often together we've come. rn miss the clear ring for the chapel, I'll miss the loud tread· on the stair ; I'll miss from the campus the 'Colonel,' I'll miss the low whispers of prayer. ''What I'll miss, 0 Goddess, sweet Memory, No matter, but listen, I pray, And tell me, will any one miss me, Yes, miss me when I am away? Will any one think of me kindly? Or any my name ever say? Oh, tell me, will any one miss me, Yes, miss me when I am. away? '' When sparkles the dew in the morning, When blazes the sun in his height, Or when in the cool summer evening The warblers sing out their good·night, O!h., then will not some one remember The .grasp and the touch of my hand, And think of when we were together United by love's golden band? '' Oh, sing to me, Goddess, an answer, In measures that tune to my heart A.nd borne on the zephyrs of evening Som.e word of the future impart. But whisper, sweet Memory, speak gently, Yet answer me quickly, I pray, And tell me, will any one miss me, Yes, miss me when I am away ? \ But why, in the misty to-morrow, When all that now is will be new, Should any one stop for a moment '\' To think of one passed from his view ? As rolleth the wave from the pebble, That waters of ocean enfold, Thus what I have done, though forgotten, Has on to eternity rolled.\ He turned and looked up at the mountain, And lingered and gazed at it long, Then bounded away for the summit Inspired with singing this song:- All hail to the future that's calling us on, And welcome the opening day, A kindly adieu in the tears we have shed, To the days that are passing away. The summit is high and the mountain is steep, Eut laurels are waving in air And sparkle, as gems from Olympian heights, For all who will take of them there. So on with a will to the struggle and toil, With breezes of fortune around, Forgetting the past in the glory to come, When labor with frui~age is crowned. Then mountains and valleys and rivers and seas, And arches of heavenly hue, ·( 1 1 . 1 . 1 ~ 1 t l 1 1 ( . 1 f ~ ,.. ' ( ( ( . 1 {

BY H. H .. TAYLOR. \Men rnust know that in this theatre of. man's life it rernaineth only to God and an- gels to be lookers-on. ''-Bacon. The curse of angered Deity, \In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,\ so emphatically pronounced on our first parents, rests to-day with the same force on their descendants. The air, whircfi at the creation echoed only the harmony of nature, and the plaudit of the Almighty, now is burdened \Vith the incessant \vhirr of machinery and the clink- ing of harcl-earned gold. Nature is at enmity with us, am d \vith thorn and thistle and the unceasing conHict of the elements, baffles the energy of the toiler. The earth, \vith zealous ca:re,. guards her en1bosomed treas- ures, and man must \Vrest them fron1 her keeping with implen1ents of his ovvn tnaking. All the cycles of poets, painters, and phi- losophers attest the necessity and dignity ot toil, by representing their highest ideals, in the performance or as the result of some great wor:k. Mythology \Vith all its sensual glan1our and fanciful imagery, is full of action. It 1nakes of its heroes gods, because of their great deeds; and by so doing indi- cates that acti<»n is the essence of their divinity. Paradoxical as it may seem, even idleness is effort; and the truth of the well-worn old adage, ''·Satan finds some mischief still for id1e hands to do,\ is proved by the great army of drones infesting the busy hive of humanity. They are busy undoing the work of industrious, law-abiding citizens, and by their acts alone make their presence felt. Inaction is impossible. From the faint- est flutter ()f the tiniest ephemera, to the almost inconceivable revolutions of th~ exte- rior planets, all is action. Nothing is the same to-day as it was yesterday or will be to-morro\v, Everything is in a state of change: a. ceaseless action and re-action of cause and effect. ()ne of the greatest of German poets says: \ Rest is c11ly changing work.\ But, 'vhile ln direct contrast t.o this class are the n1en with too many vocations. There are S<? many points toward w·hich their guns are directed, that they seldom effect a breach in the wall. There is an old saying that \ A Jack of all trades is n1aster of none,\ and its truth is self-evident. Natural po\vers must not be diffused. Patient, continued effort in one particular calling alone can -give success. As Don Quixote thought he could have made beautiful bird cages and tooth picks, if his brain had not been so full of chivalrous ideas; so tnany other persons would achieve an easy success in their callings if they were not distracted by rival ambitions. Except a few great geniuses, history identi- fies each of her chosen objects with some one achievement. You think of Milton, and insep- arable is the thought of the Paradise Lost; of Harvey, and every heart-beat sounds his name ; of Morse, and the electric current is almost seen to fly along its iron path. The saddest confession that call fall from human .lips is this--\ I have mistaken my calling.\ The \veight of woe and useless re- gret it conveys can not but sadden the light- est heart. Very true are these words of Sid- ney Sn1ith : \ If you· choose to represent the various parts in life by holes in a table of different shapes-some circular. some tri- angular, some square, some oblong, and the persons acting these parts by bits of wood of sin1ilar shapes, we shall generally find that the triangular person has got into the
