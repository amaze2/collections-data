MT will be noticed that the CONCORDIENSIS ~ is again a College h1stead of University paper as last year. . The plan of making it a University publication was tried as an ex- periment, which, not proving successful finan- cially, we have concluded to discontinue. , This change, together with our altered dress, we hope will prove satisfactory to the stu- dents, and our friends in generaL ~HE opening of the new. college year is ~ marked by a change In the manage- ment of our College. .It is a change pleas- ing to some, displeasing to others. Yet since it ends the trouble that has so long injured the reputation of the College, how can it be otherwise than a good change? But it is neither our province nor our desire to enter into a discussion of the matter. It : is a thing of the past, and should be so con- . sidered. To Dr. Potter in his new field of work we would extend our sincere wishes of success. As to \Old Union,\ we trust that a new President will soon be appointed, and · that she will resume her wonted place among the first colleges of the country. ~GAIN we are favored with a reading ~ room. The need of such an insUtu- tion was keenly felt last year, and the project to start one this year met with general ap- proval. The College furnishes a well heated, lighted, and ventilated room in which are placed the leading dailies and weeklies, to- gether with encyc-lopedias and other books of reference. But even thus soon the reading room has fallen into the san1e abuse· to which all public property is subject. Papers are scattered over the tables, to say nothing about the floor; magazines are taken away without permission, and the room is often filled with those who do not wish to read, but merely to have a little fun while waiting for a recitation. To remove these evils we would suggest that each of the papers be placed on file in a set place; that members will heed rules and not ren1ove magazines ; and that students who do not wish to read would be mindful of those who do. Good manners are acceptable even in th~ coUege -- -\\ -; reading room. u {....•.\ / ..rf? / /it...;.. ..

2 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ~HE Se~ior class is to be ... con.gratula~ed ~~ upon ·1ts prompt and harmonious action in regard to class elections. The election of Senior year officers is too often attended with strife and discord, engendered by rivalry not so tnuch between individuals as between the different societies, each anxious to secure as many honors as possible. And often, so in- tense is this spirit of rivalry and jealousy, especially when evenly divided, the class is kept in an unsettled state during the greater part of the year before a compromise is ef- fected, thus not giving the officers sufficient time to properly prepare their several parts. Nor is this the most objectionable feature. The unfriendly feeling inevitably fostered to a greater or less extent between members of the opposing parties is directly opposed to that friendliness which would otherwise ex- ist. It has been evident for some time, how- ever, that the present Senior class was averse to any such state of affairs as has existed in several classes previously, and that an effort to come to some amicable conclusion at as early a date as possible would be made. This, of course, when all were of the same mind, proved to be a comparatively easy matter, as evidenced by the satisfactory result. ~.~OTWITHST ANDING the fact that Union was victorious in the base-ball arena last year, but few of the students look back upon the record of the \Varsity'' with pride or pleasure. The experience of the past year teaches that although hired profes- sionals may win games for a college nine they can never win respect for it. They may form the backbone of a nine but they can never be pointed out with pride. Conscious of the fact that the fine playing was pur- chased by dollars and cents, the triumphant yell at the close of a successful gan1e ex- presses very little s:atisfaction. The general sentiment of the students is that we must have a strictly college nine or none at all. To effect this a plan proposed is to begin the class championship gan1es for the Yates cup in the fall, and to have every game on the list actually played. This would not only show plainly the cal!didates for the nine, but would develop new players and give to all the much needed practice. Development, not material, is wanting. It then devolves upon the classes to elect their directors promptly and to elect men who ani' inter- ested; upon the directors to schedule the games at once, to provide the players with all appliances, a~d to see that every game is played; upon the players to appear at every game and to do their best for their class and their college. mE were pleased to notice, on our return, . ~ the greatly improved appearance of the grounds connected with our college. The smoothly cut grass of the campus was bright and green,. showing that it had not been neglected during vacation. The walks and drives having been regravelled, and the- borders relaid and straightened add much to the general appearance. In regard to the buildings, however, the san1e evidenc.es of care seem wanting. While the bath-rooms are greatly in need of repairs, it is to the .state of the adjoining apartments that the authorities should direct their immediate at- tention. That in their present condition they are not only totally unfit for use, but also a disgrace to the college, must, we think, be admitted by any one having any knowl- edge of them. For a comparatively small expense, with the advantages which are easily available, if placed in the hands of a compe- tent person this evil might be remedied. We hope that a consideration for decency, to say nothing of comfort, will insure, on the part of the proper authorities, a prompt in .. vestigation of the matter. ' ~: ,....

' ~: ,.... '. ~ ' THE CONCORDIENSIS. A OREAM. With one hand resting on my open hook, The other pillowed underneath my head, I lay one afternoon beside the garden brook, And left 1ny mind to Wqnder while I read. The drowsy wind, the humming bees, Soon lulled me into slumbers soft and sweet; And then in whispers low, the tall elrn trees, A chapter o£ rny life seemed to repeat. My dreams revealed to me again the past, When in tny younger days I knew no care. And like a paroratna floating fast, Forgotten scenes passed through my vision there. And softly as the water's gentle flow I heard, or seetned to hear, one breathe my name. 'Twas then in murmurs wondrous soft and low, The sweet voice of an angel sister came. Again I heard her voice and saw her face; The face that wore the same $Weet smile of old_ That smile she gave me filled with tender grace, Gilds all my memories of her with a tint of gold. And as I think of her my thoughts more pure Arise, and make me be better while I live. S0 if I for my faults thus find a cure, 'Twill unto her dear name more glory give. Words cannot paint that happy dream of mine, Or half express the happy joy I felt; It seetned almost a taste of joy divine, . Before I saw tny vision into nothing melt. 'Twas but a dream, but still I know It !Uakes me happier when it comes to mind, In dreatns the dre~ry earth was far below, And work and care were for a moment left behind. How do you like our looks? Got your notice yet ? The bath-room~ ought to be heated. Davies' Bourdon instead of Newcom b. \88 has adopted a constitution. What next? Why don't the Freshmen produce a foot- ball? Lawn tennis seems to be the principal out door sport. \\ Chapel exercises· are conducted this term by Prof. Hawley. ._ I We have been disappointed in not receiv-. ing the cut designed for our cover, but hope · to have it before our next issue. Prof. Lamoroux is situated in his new quarters in the Powers building. . Prof. Hawley has taken rooms in middle section,, N. C., one of '\¥hich he occupied while a student. Prof. Chaplin has been appointed commit- tee on chapel absences. An appropriate ap- pointment. Prof. of French: \Give the French for 'The student's friend.'\ Student: \ L'ami--(Class comes down). The Kappa Alphas gave a social at their rooms, September 29. It was a pleasant affair. '87 has defeated '86 and '88. Will it de- feat '8 5 and have its name engraved on the cup? Judge Landon has been appointed Presi- dent until the place can be permanently filled. The reading-room, which had for a tin1e fallen into disuse, has been revived. Prof. Perkins is happy again. His family arrived in Dorp the first part of September . The room adjoining the reading-room will soon be opened; it is now being fitted up for books of reference. Pay up your subscription before N ovem- ber 15, and receive the benefit of there- duction. Prof. Price has so far regained his strength as to attend recitations again. We hope he will soon be able to resume his usual amount of work. \ Old Gray,\ so long fan1iliar to the boys, succumbed during vacation to old age, since which time \ Sorrel\ has done double duty, until a few days ago, when a mate was pur- chased. \' Prof. IraN. Hollis, U. S. N., who has left such pleasant recollections with the students of the last few years, was visiting friends in town last week on a leave of absence fro1n · the \ Dolphin.\ We were all glad to see him.

The original intention was to have the book-racks placed on rollers so the room could be cleared foo.· dancing. We think it unfortunate that this plan was not carried out.

'The \set ups\ have been exceptionally attractive this year. '8'8 has shown itself hospitable within Union's \valls by comply- ing with the wishes of .'87, and bringing out the fruit, cider, etc. The ~reshrnan who in- vited the Sophs to lunch at his house on the following Friday evening, perplexed that class not a little. With some misgivings th-ey proceeded in a body to his house on the ap:ointed evening when, instead of being driven away as some predicted, they were cordially received. The Sopbs soon made themselves at ho1ne,t and entertained each other with stories, politics and music. rhe sLipper was well served, and proved tnost interesting as a wine supper. After singing the class song, three cheers were given to the host and all was over. . The following are the officers of the vari- nus classes so far as heard from : Senior-President, F. W. Ray ; Vice- President, ~\. Bond; Secretary, J. H. Mc- Carthy ; Treflsurer, H. D. Griswold ; B. B. D., T. J. Delaney; Orator, E. Terril; Poet, A. B. Bishop; Historian, W. T. Foote; Ad- dresser, W. H.

The Freshmen evidently are quite proud of their military suits, as a considerable num- ber attended 1n full uniform the Republi, can parade last week in i\lbany. So elated were they with the apparent impression which they created in the minds of the Al- banians that they detennined, if possible, to heighten this effect. In furtherance of this plan they proceeded to equip themselves with walking-sticks, thus presenting the anomalous spectacle of a first term Freshn1an with a cane. Cne or twq Sophomores who happened to be in attendance, observing this breach of college etiquette, took the first train horne and hastened to n1ake known the doings of the \cheeky Frosh.\' A con1mittee of Sophomores conseq~ently met the her()es on their return and proceeded to confiscate the emblern.s of Sophomoric dignity. Not accomplishing this, they retired, expressing sentim,ents boding no good to the audacious ones, who may think themselves lucky if they escape with anything less than a cooling draught from the pump. .. At a meeting of the New York State In- tercollegiate Base Ball Association, held at the Vanderbilt House, Syracuse, the 24th insL, no award of the pennant was made, on the, ground that all the nines in the league, with the exception of Cornell, had profes- sionals. Cornell was also de barred by using men whose names had not been entered in accordance with the rules of the association. 'I. J. Delaney, '85, represented Union at the n1eeting. The annual meeting will be held the last Friday of January next, \vhen the various colleges are req nested to send dele- gates for the purpose of forming an Inter- collegiate Athletic Association, which will l~old a general field day annually at one of the colleges. But few opportunities are offered the stu- dents, as residents of Schenectady, in the way of lectures, musical entertainments, etc. By the course of. entertainments to be given under the auspices of the Second R.eformed Church this want ·will be supplied. We can- not too strongly advise the students to avail themselves of the opportunity thus offered. On November 6 the course will begin with a lecture by the Rev. T. Dewitt Tahnage. His national reputation as a speaker ought to insure for him a large attendance by the stu- dents. This lecture will be followed by a humorous lecture on \Cranks\ by the Hon. Thomas M. Taylor, of New York. Other entertainments of equal interest will follow, among which we would particularly mention the readings of Miss Helen Potter. Miss Potter is perhaps the best impersonator of character in the country. In fact, the wbole course is such that we cannot too strongly itnpress upon the students the advantages of attending. The course is a remarkably cheap one; season tickets being but one dollar. :For sale at Swart & Van .l.~uken's book store.

\_ .. 6 TI--IE CuNCORDIENSIS. Our literary matter has been u11avoidably crowded out this issue. We are glad to state that Mr. Charles Vanderveer, our former popular instructor in gymnastics, has resumed his old place. An association to be known as the Union College Musical Association has been organ- · ized with the following o.:fficers: . President, Prof. Chaplin ; Musical Director, Prof. Haw- ley ; Asst. Director, Mills, '85; Secretary, Ransdell, '87; Treasurer, Woodbridge, '86; Business Manager, Foote, '85. later they filed into the dini11g hall and seated themselves at the table loaded down with the luxuries of the season. After singing sever- al songs with the usual vigor, the supper was attended to in the satisfactory and system- . atic manner which is attained only through the strict discipline afforded by a college boarding-house. After the physical wants had been satisfied, a mental111e121t was served. up in an equally enjoyable n1anner. The fi.rst step in the right direction was taken . by the appointment of Stanton as toast-mas- . ter. Ohio was responded to by Mills, with Efforts are being ~made among the students t,o start lawn tennis and bicycle clubs. There · are now in the college several adepts at the former and a number of skillful bicyclists, qnd it is probable that Union will soon have tennis and bicycle clubs that may do as much to support her name as her ball clubs. \Character in Smoking\ is the title of an excellent article recently published. The writer judges his men by the kind of tobacco they smoke. All like good tobacco, but all are not judges. It is only the even-tem- pered, level-headed, tastefully-inclined man that takes pains to make a selection. He gets to be very particular about purity and flavor. But when he strikes a tobacco like Blackwell's Durham Long Cut, he is tena- cious of his nrize and intolerant of all inferior .L tobaccos. Rev. Giles P. Hawley, lately chosen Pro- fessor of Logic and Rhetoric, in place of Rev. George Alexander, resigned, graduated from Union in '71. After completi.ng his course at Union Theological Seminary, New York, he was successively teacher of natural sciences in the State Nor mal School at Pots- dam, N. Y.; Professor of Latin and Greek in the Syracuse high school; Pastor of the Second Presbyterian church at Saratoga Springs, N. Y., and pastor of the Presbyte- rian church of Mechanicville, N. Y., which last position he resigned to accept the one which he now occupies. the brevity characteristic of hin1, perpen- dicularly.
