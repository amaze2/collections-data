Editor Concordienszs :- \\1hy is it that the engineers are a specially favored class at Union? As this is not a school of engineering, and the engineers form but a small proportion of the students. this seems to be a pertinent quesfion if it can be shown that they are so favored. When a classical student asks to be allowed to take Hebre\v or Chemistry 1il place of Mathen1atics he is told that this is not a col- lege to prepare men for particular vocations, but to give thetn a geJ!eral foundation for their future studies. The consequence is that when he graduates he is no further advanced in his special study of Law, Divinity or l\1ed- icine than svhen he entered colleg-e. But wit~ the engineers it is ~ifferent. All through their course they are g1ven only such studies as are directly of advantage to tbem, and \V hen they graduate with the degree of C. E. they are ready to start out in a special line at once. · The classical student is compelled to take Mechanics in h1s Junior year. Everyone kno,Ns that this study is of no use \V hatever to a ·.-:;an who intends to becon1e a Minister, Lawyer or Doctor, but it is said to be a good mental drill.
