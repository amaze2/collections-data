My friend is a very intellectual 1 nan, but Encircled in a hoop of gold, formed in the is full of odd fancies. He declares the truest . likeness of a snake with its tail in its mouth, words Shakespeare ever wrote to be ''There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, . than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\ · One of his oddest fancies is that some infiu- enca emanating from the soul of one departed lingers around his clothing and 1•rivate ai·ti- cles. He says that he himself has felt this subtle personality in reading the books o£ old . dead authors. For this reason he likes to wander around in old libraries. The sweet- est p~rfume to his nostrils is the scent or old parchments and black letter books. I like rather to visit the old jewelry and curiosity shops while we are here in Rome on our post graduate tour in Europe. Old Gonzalez keeps a bric-a-brac shop about hal£ way down from our hotel on the Via Del Populo, where I spend many a hal£ hour looking at the old medallions and . golden filagree ·work belonging, once, per- haps, to some old dead C;:esar, or hung upon the snowy bosom of some chaste Aurelia or £air Fulvia. Gonzalez is always showing me something new, or rather old, which he offers at a bargain ( ?) but, alas! my purse is lim- · ited and many o£ his best bargains are not for me. emblem of eternity which the Romans bor- rowed £rom the Egyptians, was a cameo which words cannot describ3. The stone was cut into the likeness of one o£ those ideal Italian maiden faces who smile, in the pic- tures, down from some balcony on their dark- eyed lovers. The· face was perfect, so perfect that one cared not £or the absence of color; and really the price did seem insignificant when compared w-ith the beauty o£ the work- manship. What better present for the ap- proaching wedding o£ my friend? So I said, \That's rather too much to ask, Gonzalez, but, if you will throw in that little gold chain I was admiring yesterday, I'll take it.\ \Si Signore.\ As he ·was doing the1n up, I turned idly to the window and saw, or thought I saw, the very original of the face on the cameo flit by; the same large, lustrous e; e fringed by long black lashes, the same creamy pallor, and her P-air was Titian's gold. The next instant I saw my friend acToss the street, with an eage1· look on his face, htuTy- ing along in the direction the owner of the face had taken. Snatching up my purchase I dashed across the street and locked mv arm in his, \Whither away so fast?\ With- ) \

Iam a marl of strong nerves, o£ tha carneo, as I was walking down that but the room seemed full o£ a horrid presence .. little by-stree,t on which lived, shall I confess ' Mustering all my c::mrage, I snatched the it? the only woman I ever loved or can love. I saw a picturasque looking young man in , the dress o£ an Italian sailor come out of that little house and kissing his hand to the window with a jaunty gracs, he passed me. I hurried up hoping to catch· a sight. o£ my divinity,. and,. with my eyes turned toward . the balcony, ran into my friend 1:vho was . coming up the street. His face was distorted · with p::tssion, his ha11ds worked c=>nvulsively, • his eyes looked like a murderer's. The shock · of our sudden 1neeting see1ned to sober him and he made no resistance -when I locked arms with him and led him away £rom the cottage. We walked about a block when suddenly he broke out, \Did you see that yourr:g sailor ? Six tim3s have I seen him with my Teresa in his arms.~~ He knew· m ')fa than I, that her name was TBresa. But his TarC)sa ! \What business have your call- ing her yours ?\ I asked, \aud how could you se3 her in that fellows aTms ? Clara is the only one you have any right to call yours.\ 'Vhat more I would h::tve p'oured forth I do not know ; but he stopped me with, \Harry let us leave Rome to-night, now.\ But now I ·was the unwilling one. III. The next morning a~out ten o'clock, we were late risers, I heard a cry awful enough to chill a man's blood, which seemed to come £rom George's room. I rushed up the stairs, burst open the door to his Toom. There on the bed lay my friend with that\ cameo on his heart; his .right hand clutching it as though he were trying to pluck it off but could not, his le£t extended as though to ward off something, which threatened to oppress him, and such a look in his eyes as I hope I may never see again, a look as o£ a carne8 £rom his br2ast, the pallor and cahn of death instantly succeeded the excited look on his £a ca. Just then, through the chain- hers reverberated the sound of the great antique knocker on the ·old palazzo's door. Hardly knoViring whEtt I did, hut fe2ling somehow as thou_sh help. were at hand, I staggered down the stairs, U!ldid the chain, slid back the bolt, and let in a party o£ three ; Miss Arnot, heT mother, and her brother, a young Oxford s·tudent. \Why you look ill. What is the matter ? exclaimed Miss Arnot .• '·Gaorge-up-stah·s''-I gasped, and strong man as I was fainted. When I came to, I saw George bending over me and, clasping my arms around his neck, I cried like a child. As he lifted his ·noble head I sa\:v tears in his eyes. \It was Clara's love and will that saved me,\ George said a few days later, \she called me back £rom death and worse than death. The dear little girl worried so about me when she ·had not heard £ron1 me for m0re than a month, and she had a dteam which made he:r: be- lieve I was in t1·ouble.; so off she started straight £or Rome. What a miserable whelp I was to such a darling ! Thank- God, , she need never know o£ my folly.\ George is all over his infatuation now. ;He and Olara are on theiT weddi11g trip. And I ? well, I am wandering around trying. to get rid o£ this dull pain. The world is not hal£ as bright as it was. I passed the little 4<;>use the day be.fore I left Rome and it had re.,. sumed its £ormer desolate app~ar.ance. A spider had spun a great net across its door- way, the windows were .curtained. only with webs and dust. I asked an old woman across the way about the house.

W HEN Daniel Webster, who was the youngest of a large family, was half through his college course he deter1nined that Ezekiel his brother next older should be educated also. Ezekiel entered college the year after his famous brother was grad- uated, and Daniel undertook to support him there by teaching in Fryeburgh for thirt:r dollars per month. All the money that he could save £rom his salary was handed over to his brother who it will further appear was sometimes sadly in need of it. The young ladies about Fryeburgh seem to have had a tendency to fall in love with the sad-eyed, dark, and handsome youth, for in a letter to a friend the young Webster makes this phy- siological proposition: \If there should be a new edition of human nature, I think it would be found expedient to give girls stronger ribs, and a thicker covering for the heart. I say a plague to the girls if they can't keep their little beaters at home.\ Ezekiel writes to him fro1n college:- \ Money, Daniel, rnoney. As I was walking- down to the office after a letter, I happened to find one cent which is the only money I have had since the second day after I came on. It is a f~ct, Dan, that I was calle.d on for a dollar, where I owed It. and have borrowed It four times since to pay those I borrowed of. Yours without money, \EZEKIEL.\ In reply Daniel writes:- It was at Coney Island, and at that hour when the sun seems larger as it comes down · to \sup with the ocean.'' He waA carelessly walking along the strand, and in fancy li-ving his life over again-again he was a boy-again he was in college-staid out late at night-. again he flunked ! Just at th~t moment his attention was drawn to a child playing in the sand ·and his reverie was broken. As he dr,ew nearer and nearer the child, it seemed more and more remarkable. Its countenance was familiar, yet he ·had never seen the child before. Those thin, cu1·ling lips, that pecu- liarly chiseled nose, the flash of those black eyes, all familiar ; whose child could it be ? While he was playing with the child, a lady approached, her gait and form-a]~s ! he · knew her still better. It was she ! It was his college girl ! She had marT~ed B: short time after he left college, and this child·was her first born. \I have now by me two cents in lawful federal cur- rency; next week I will send them if they be all.

DURING the year.now nearing .its end, it can be truly sa1d that the hbrary has · been of practical use to a large n urn. ber of · students. When we consider that during the • collegiate year, there is : 1. A total of some ~00 essays and 140 orations written in the college. 2. That from the English and other departments of the college, there is constant reference to the library. 3. That the seniors are largely required to use it in their study in the English depart~ent. 4. That there are 8 prizes, which necessitate the use of the library and for these prizes, there is a total of about 45 1nen competing. 5. That with each graduating class there are 10 com- mencement themes to be prepared. 6. That the engineers make constant use o£ the library in the preparation of their theses. 7. That each week of the term there are two debates in the respective societier3, which should bring an average of 12 men per week to its use. 8. That throughout the year there are various public debates and other exercises, and the 1isual amount of priva~e investigation and study. We can see that the library· has a large field for us~fulness among the students and tha-t its work in the college is no small one. The work of the library is constantly broadening, and the students are finding it both a useful and necessary part of their course. I£ this department in any degree C;)ntributes to the growth o£ interest in the library and gives any information that is ben- eficial-to readers and students, it will have accomplished its object. METHOD IN INVESTIGATION. I N looking up a subject in the library, the best results can be obtained by preserving some definite method of search and not by a · hap-hazard and loose overhauling of the cat- alogues and indexes. Begin with the eard ca-talogue and note down any references found there, next take the catalogues o£ the Boston Athenaeum and Brooklyn Mercantile and make further note of any additional references, . then e~haust the encyclopedias and the peri- odicals by using Poole's Index and· its bound supplements and you will then have a fairly . co1nplete s~t of references, and what is better ·a method_. ~hat will apply in all cases. All that. is taught in college amounts to very i little, that is of practical benefit except as an index to the volume of facts, and a self- reliant, accurate a:~a0- methodical know ledge o£ the means of getting at those facts from the original is invaluable. The college course tends to much, to give students undue confidence in text-books and it is only by getting familiar with the source of the text- books, that one can learn the means of keep- . ing up with the knowledge of the day. The time teas -_when the library was very much like a museum, and an occasional visitor looked with curious eyes at the backs o£ the . ancient books. The time is when the libra- : rian is a te~cher in the highest sense and the reader uses the books as a workman among his tools. \-'> HOW TO P:ftESERVE THE RESULrrs OF READING. C HARLES Llj\.MB once said, in his quaint and delightful way, that he wished to ask a \grace before reading\ more than a \grace before dinner.\ And if one can make his mind capable of .retaining 'fhat he reads, reading well deserves any praise that even Lamb ca:r;t give it. The,best rule for making the mind preserve information and quota- tions, is to force,i£ necessary, a profound inter- est in the theme or book being read. And ) ' . l

E DITOR LIBRARY NoTES: Although it is a debatable question whether or not the library should allow its books to circulate ; it is surely to be acknowledged that it should open its doors at all available hours. It has been rumored that the library committee thought of opening for a few hours on Sun- day afternoon and I wTi te this to urge that this be adopted. \'\Vith the number of peri- magazines carefully ~nd note as_ above and oq.icals now in the li.brary and with the large you will have the latest a11d in many cases number of books that are proper matter for · c £he best information to be ~btained.

Among the \Grinds\ and \Pickings\ we notice, as every Teader must have noticed, some things whose appearance in our college publication .we cannot hut regret. that his name appeal's neithel' on the SenioT class list nor in the College catalogue~ No 1nention is made o£ the fact that he was in college but a few weeks, seldom appeared in the class-rooms and is at present a regular member of the class o£ '88 at Harvard. This at first 1night .seem to be another case of \duplex personality,\ but we presume that a more satisfactory explanation o£ this apparent paradox will be found in the records o£ one o£ the fraternities.

DITORS CoNCORDIENSIS : There was a lit- , tle notice in the Troy Polytechn£c on the dispute between Cornell and Union which . was very amusing since it displayed such an· exhaustive knowledge o£ the subject. In the first place what does a technical in- stitute in Troy know about the action of the . New York State I nter-colleg:iate Athletic Association. Next what have the merits of the Ooncor- d£ensis got to do with a coJnJnunicalion in its • columns from one who has no connection with the paper. We are willing to rest the dispute on its · merits before any candid judge ; but we do • not wish to put R. P. I. and Co1·nell on the · same footing as opponents. Other dark eyes beam as brightly, Other red lips dare me on, Yet none other has a lover Who is so completely won. Oh! I love thee, thou canst prove me, \iVholly am I now thine own. Thou canst ne'er refuse a heart Fond as mine. Spring? Base Ball! And Lawn Tennis! Hard work for prizes. Marvin, '87 has the measles. Baker is at home suffering from a fever. Candidates for base ball positions practice daily. The Phi Delta Theta society have moved into 101 State street. Tennis courts have all been rolled and are in a good condition. Prof. to Junior-' 'What is the organ o£ respiration ?\ Mr. W., \the heart.\ We really wish however that the former institution could keep from prying into that which does not concern it and of which it knows nothing. For a refutation o£ their .scurrilous article ' Tutor Stoller has returned from abroad . ~nd makes the recitations unusually interest- Ing. I would rafer them to the March issue of the . Hobart Herald, and would in conclusion ad- vise them to remember that he who 'throws . mud' is sure to bedaub himself, while (though we acknowledge that from constant practice R. P. I. is an adept in the art) the chances are he will not dirty his opponents. However you may £eel toward us we envy not your reputation either iu Troy or adjacent cities. LOCAL. GONE, CLEAR GONE.
