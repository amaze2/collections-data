T h e recent gradmg changes were developed and adopted totally ~ithin ~he faculty and students were neither told of the 1mpendmg change' nor accorded a decent regard for their opinion (which' wasn't even sought). Yet no one is mo·re directly effected by this decision than students themselves. It is rather conceited of the faculty (or administration) to assume that they have a ~onopoly on. good_ ideas and worthy opinions. The new gradmg system IS basically good but it might have been better (and ce.rtainly no ~~rse) after having taken into account student Ideas and opm10ns. In the past two years, the All-Col~eg_e Cou~cil has occasionally taken a stand on non-academic Issues, ~rnport­ ant to the Campus community. It has been responsible. for the liberal social rules, and more recently for the revised convocation system. All in all the experiment which created the ACC has been successf~l. It has been shown that definite good can emerge for the campus commuJ?-ity w_hen students, faculty and administration representatives sit down as equals to deal with campus issues. With this experience behind us, Union m~s~ now take the next bold, progressive step forward. ~peCifiCalJy, that means to establish an All-College Academic Counc1l (AC- AC) along the lines of the present ACC, to bring t?gether stud~nts, faculty, and administration rel?resen~atlves to discuss and legislate in the area of academic affairs, ;vhere students in the present have no formal representation or power. Such a council could consist of one student chosen from each of the four academic divisions, to be selected by the student council after student candidates had petitioned the council for appointments to the body. Likewise, one faculty member from each division would be appointed by the faculty council. The President and the Dean of the College would sit ex-officio. Such a council could be quite informal if the members wished. It would meet regularly to discuss questions of academic policy, vote and send its recommendations to the Student Council and Faculty Council for approval. Hope- fully all questions of academic policy would be discussed (and' perhaps proposed) first of all in the ACAC, We urge that the All-Co~ege Coun~il, the ~tudent Council, and the Faculty Counc1l move w1th all_dehberat.e speed to establish such an All-C?ll~ge. ~cadennc Counc~l (or to appropriately expa~d the JUrisdiC~IOn and composi- tion of the present ACC 1f that IS practical) so that stu- dents may have their rightful part in formulating academic policy.

'Where Lnere are not, graae:s may still oe ~·ecorded s1mp1y as A, B, C, ul' D. 1 am also surprised that Mr. .tfathaway see!lls to th1nK that \VWbrems aane or ·pomts ot lll· .:ugnt aemonstrated on a paper\· are non-subJective, and not cri· ter1a usea m maJrmg such dis· Llnctions m Center 1. 1 nave not tound, in practice, that students !lght !or mmor test po1nts harder on this sys· Lem than on others. lf anythmg, 1nstead of havmg all C stuaents cunnnced that they can talk themselves mto a B, I find that only C plus students will make the effort. Whether the new system will have an effect in increasing com- petition is doubtful, so flat state· ments that it will or it won't seem to me to be out of place until evidence is in one way or the other. Although the best motivation for a student is in· terest in the course combined with a means of judging how well he is doing in it, we are all aware that any grading scale is used for other purposes than feedback, and that competition has both good and bad aspects. I don't see that evidence one way or the other would affect the issue. The so-called \pass-fail\ sys- tem is an entirely separate is· sue. The only argument I have heard at Union from those in favor of it is the \bandwagon\ argument, which deserves n o reply. If any students or faculty are seriously in favor of it, why not present its comparative ad· vantages and disadvantages, and investigate its effect at compar· able schools which have tried it?

Peti- twns expressmg student dlssat- lstactwn over tne system, s1ated to go mto e11ect next year, have rece1ved wide circu1at10n on campus. The arguments on the system, both .pro and con, de· serve some discussion. Prof. Michael ;:,hmagel, Eng- lish lJepartment Chairman, who pro.posed the gradmg change to the .tacuLty counci'l, ongmaUy usted ilve major reasons far intraducmg the system: l>istinctions \First the present system simply does not allow for ade- quate and fair distinctions among students. Most students are md1scnnnnate1y lumped into 'broad C or B categones, w1th no distinctions drawn be· tween the high and low per· formers in these categones ... \:Second the present system tends to discourage academic motivation among students, for a student soon learns that he can still earn a ,C or even a B in a course .if he does less warlc than would ordinarily be expected of him were he to .be graded more accurately w1th pluses and minuses. Diluted Significance . \Third the present system dl· lutes the significance of true academic achievement, especi· ally Dean's List. standing, . for again students w1th a B mll~l!-S average in three course~ qualify as much as students with a B plus average •.• \Fourth the present system serves to protect the mediocre or poor student by failing to distmguish properly among ~tu­ dents in the C and D categones. \Fifth the present system fails to 'make meaningful and p r e c i s e definiti~ns for '&ooq standing,' 'academ1c warm;ng, 'eligibility,' or even contmu- ance in the College.\ As far as student opinion was concerned, it ran largely against the new grading system but was widely diversified in its reasons far opposition. No Chance One reason which was often cited in opposition to the sys- tem was that the students were not informed of a possible change nor given ap.y oppor- tunity to express the1r feelmgs on the issue. The Student Coun- cil took immediate action in protesting the change as have petitioners led by Kenneth Gold· man. But more than once \g uation without representat10n has been raised in the minds of the students. \Grade consciousness\ was another phase which appeared in discussions of the system.

He sa1d that student apathy on campus grows out ot the lack or an ettective stimulus !or learnmg and mteuectuallty. The new gractmg system wou1ct con· ce1vao1y prov1ae this st1mULus. Undone Professor bhmagel den~ed that the mstitut1on of a l>aSs· fau system wou1d upgrade tne intellectual lUe at umon. 1he pass-rail system, he said, wou~cl mean that \less wauld be done, and even that would be more poorly done.\ He predicted that a pass-fail system at lJ mon wouid mean that more time would be spent in nonintellec· tual pursuits and the present quality, or lack thereof, of stu· dent work would suffer accord· ingly, When asked his views on the recent Yale grading change, Shinagel pointed out that the Union man is not the Yalie.

So By ALLAN MILI.ER This past week witnessed the efforts of three of Union's six- fraternities to contribute to the intellectual life of the . college community. On Wednesday night, Mr. Richard Nunez, a professor. at the State University o f New York at Albany and a candi- Jate for the Democratic Nation- al Convention, spoke to a group ., of approximately twenty-five students and one faculty mem- ber at the Phi Gamma Delta 1 on the topic of \The .. , ew State DemGcratic Pri- June, which will help •to bring together the college and city communities.\ Fiji Again Union's Chi Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta Saturday, April 20 precented the col:lege with a $70 check and the Steinmetz Manuscript in celebration of its 75th anniversary. President Martin and Frank- lin Kneedler, Vice Presid'ent in charge ef External Affairs, were present to accept the gifts to the college. The manuscript is now on display in Schaefer Li- brary. The check is the first in a series of annual gifts to the college. Dr. Walter C. Langsam, Presi- dent of the University of Cin- cinatti and a Fiji alumnus, was the guest speaker at Saturday's festivities. He was <me of more than 50 Fiji alumni who wit- nessed the dedication of the liv- ing room of the chapter house to Frank S. Hoffman, a Fiji founder. A plaque was mounted in Mr. H0ffman's honor. The following e'lection pre- cedures and schedules for class officers, Student Council repre- sentatives, officers of Student Council, and All College Coun- cil representatives have been established: Petitions for class officers (President, Vice President, Sec- retary, and Treasurer) are avail- able in the Student Activities Office and must be returned by Tuesday, April 30.

' Nunez said that he did not r know Mr. McCarthy personally and was not so much interested in the Senator's views on speci- • 1 fie issues since these situations would probably change by the time the next President assumes office. Rather, his support for I . Senator McCarthy stems from (' belief in the man's courage, .' I .,, 1 his basic personal integrity, and the general direction in which he is heading. Psi U, Too Later that same evening, the · Psi Upsilon Fraternity hosted a student-faculty get-together. The purpose of this e v e n t was to allow the students and facul- ty to meet together outside of the classroom in an informal social background, to allow free discussion of their respective feelings and ideas. Judged quantitatively, these two fraternity-sponsored events were somewhat disapnointing, as fewer than five non-brothers showed up at Fiji, and less than five faculty members turned up at Psi U. Qualitatively, however, the events were a success. Never- theless, it would seem that on the whole the rest of the college J 1 ' iS community has not yet had time to adjust to the faternities' growing participation in the in- tellectual development of the campus. r, Sigma Phi Last night, the brothers of Sigma Phi also sponsored a din- ner guest. Joseph Monaco, Dep- uty Chief of the Schenectady Police Department, made a short after-dinner speech con- cerning the consequences of underage drinking in Schenec- tady. Mr, Monaco also agreed to answer questions, and the ensu- ing discussion centered around the legal implications of pre- marital fornication, statutory rape, and the possession of il- legal drugs. A spokesman for the house stated that due to Mr. Monaco's busy schedule, there was insuf- ficient time for adequate pub- licity, and the evening's activi- ties were therefore not formal- ly opened to the campus. But, • \the chief gave us a good idea which we hope to initiate before Let the lager freely flow.

Thirdly, it is extremely diffi- cult to tell from one or two exams, or one or two papers, which student is the hard work- er. This difficulty is furthered under the conditions of a large class. And if the professor uses the \numbers system\ as poli- tical science instructors are wont to do, assigning each stu- dent a number , the idea of re- warding the hard worker be- comes meaningless. And how can the professor hope to dis- tinguish between the hard work- er and the innately gifted stu- dent who doesn't need to work as hard to achieve just as high a level of performance? So al the new system can hope to do is to penalize the lazy student- while penalizing the hard worker at the same time. Professor Shinagel is cor- rect - the present system is not very good. But neither is democracy a very good form of government - it's just that all the others are so much worse. The same holds true for the present grading system.

Con- sidering the weather and condi- tion of the track, both winning performances were encouraging. Ericson was clocked in eleven seconds flat, while Sessoms won in 23.6. AI easily triumphed in the 440, with Jeff Spaulding taking third. Carl Thurn had little trouble capturing the 880. Ron McAvoy and Art McCabe teamed for another Garnet 1-2 finish in the intermediate hur- dles. The hosts also placed 1-2 in both the high jump and the long jump. Fitz Turner and Art McCabe turned the trick in the high jump, while McCabe and McAvoy did likewise in the long jump. George Gardner took the shot put. with Ed Blechner Rugby The Rugby Club opens its season tomorrow at 1:00 on Li- brary Field with a match ver- sus Albany Medical School. The visitors are 2-0, having defeated Albany Law and Colgate B team, but the Garnet is confident of a victory, and should put on a good show for the weekend crowd. third. Ed also added a second place in the discus. McCabe rounded out another stellar multi-event per-formance with a triumph in the triple jump. Tom Oberst and Turner finished 1-2 in the Javelin. RH will be a tou!{h foe for both the frosh and the varsity. Both the Engineers' squads are strong and deep, and the Dutch- men will be hard pressed to capture the necessary runner-up positions that spell victory. Out- standing performances in the field events, as well as contin- ued success in the dashes and middle distances, wil'l be needed if the Garnet are to avenge last year's 104-41 stomping. Frosh Lacrosse Falls To Tough Syracuse and Hobart By JAY ELITZMAN Union's fr(}sh stickmen played twice this past week, losing 13-9 at Syracuse, and 13-5 to Hobart in a home encounter. They now stand at 1-2, 4-3 including scrimmages. They take on Colgate tommrew at 2:30. The Garnet journeyed to Syracuse to play the Orangemen this past Tuesday. Syracuse is in a phase of re-building following their displacement as a bona fide national power. Their last two frosh squads wEre undefeated, and it appeared that Coach Erown's contingent would be facing perhaps its most severe test of the season. The frosh tallied e a r 1 y in t h e f irs t period, b u t the Orangemen responded with four quick goals and sustained pressure resulting from the control of faceoffs and resulting fastbreak oppmtunities. Trailing by a 4-1 margin the Garnet gamely rallied, paced by the timely scodng of Ken Lorenze who hit for three scores. The big play of the game was Do·n Hoover's score in the final period which knotted the score at 9-9, necessitating an overtime period. It took the Syracuse frosh two overtimes to assert themselves and control the tempo of the game. The Hobart contest on Wednesday was played in field condi- tions which were less than ideaL Attack Wayne Christie had diffi- culty maneuvering in the thick mud as did Ned Dukehart and the entire squad, with the exception of Lorenze who netted two and was one of few bright spots in the Garnet's effort. Rit Gallucci turned in an aggressive performance, and rnidfielder Bruce Dugan was impressive. The Garnet grabbed the lead, as they did in the Syracuse encounter, and led at one stage, 4-2. Hobart then unleashed eight consecutive goals, five of them coming before intermission. ------~------------------~~----~~~~~------ at CI:enter:r-Acndemir:..mle~~nrth. ~- 1492 COMMONWEALTH AVENUE BOSTON I MASSACHUSETTS 02135 The International Center for Academic Research is designed to help every student achieve his maximum potential in the su biect, or subjects, of their choice.

Linksmen Open; Ve·rgith First By SKOWRON A week of summer-like wea- ther that's presented mid-season conditions has enabled the golf team to keep improving and in- creased their chances for open- ing meet success today. A 1:00 P.M. triangular meet pitted the Garnet Iinksmen against Hobart and St. John-Fisher at the Gen- eva Country Club. At the re- quest of the Hobart coach, the starting sqtlads had only six in- stead of the usual seven golfers for the 18 hole contest. Doug Vergith will play number one followed by Rich Horsman, John Hine, Ward Blum, Rich Critch- low, and Dick Adams. All the starter's games have shown im- provement, but Adams is the most improved player having climaxed a move from a non- starting position to sixth man with a recent challenge match victory over Jeff Smith. The meet is St. John-Fisher's open- ing meet while Hobart stands 0-2 losing to R.P.I. 7-2 and drop- ping a match to Ithaca 8-1.

The Orangemen controlled faceoffs, moved the ball around at lightning speed, and baffled Union goalies Andy Bittker and Ken Auerbach. Their passing, speed, stickhan- dling, and shooting would have overpowered nearly any de- fense, and they had no trouble with the young Garnet defend- ers, rattling them for eight goals in the first period.

Student Concern Student concern over the problem of the deficit in Negro students at Union and other colleges has been demonstrated recently in the formation of the Black Student Alliance, by the circulation of a petition voicing concern over the issue and by last Friday's Teach-In where several students expressed their opinions on the topic. At the Teach-In President Harold C. Martin had announced that steps were being taken by the faculty and administration regarding the issue. The open f@rum discu.ssion on Thursday will mark the first time the issue has been discussed by the students and administration jointly. Yes Virginia, Faculty Are Hired & Fired Ra.tionally a Master's Next , entertain ~ anniver- · series on By LLOYD WOLKENFELD Assiduous research by the Concor- diensis staff has uncovered the pro· cedures by which the College hires, and promotes faculty, and makes ten- ure decisions. The pages of the \Union College Faculty Handbook\ reveal that there is a pattern to teacher hiring. from the College curricu}um or finan- cial difficulties within the College may warrant such dismissal. Further, sustained charges of moral turpitude, teaching incompetence, mental or phy- sical incapacity, or violation of the Feinburg Law against Communist af- filiation are adequate reasons for dis- missal. All those dismissed on tenure, ex:cept those charged with moral tur- pitude, receive one year of full salary and retirement benefits. P.M. • New appointments are for one, two, or three years, with rank and salary to be determined by the academic background and teaching experience of the appointee. Appointments to the rank of In- structor are for one or two years and require a bachelors degree. Assistant '! . professors are hired for two years, implicity renewable, and must have at least a Master's degree and a demonstrated professional competence and scholarly activity. The Union College Faculty also boasts a strong chapter of the Ameri- can Association of University Profes- sors, with membership, according to Prof. Sherwood Fox, president of the Union College branch, of from 65 to 75% of the faculty. The purpose of the A.A.U.P. is to defend academic freedom and promote faculty welfare. Fox added that there have been no serious infringements of academic freedom on campus for some time, and the main significance of the organization is that it is here, to be useful if needed. By PAl:JL FARNHAM M9re than 80 students gathered outside Nott Memorial for the vigil last Friday morning while nearly 2:l5 attended the afternoon teach-in Eu- gene Kokot, ad hoc chairman of the Campus Action Committee, said Mon- day. Kokot termed the day's activities \a success as far as what was anti- cipated but only a moderate success as fa~ as what could have happened.\ He cited the \appalling lack of fac- ulty\ at the vigil where only Prof. Sherwood Fox and Prof. Arnold Bit- tleman were present. In the afternoon about 25 faculty members visited the teach-in for vary- ing lengths of time. Kokot said the administration was very favorable to all of the day's events. There was no condemnation .of ~uttin~ by students or professors caH- mg of classes he added. President Haro'ld Martin opened the afternoon's activities and remained there for most of the session. According to Kokot, this was in direct contrast to the administration at the State Uni- versity of New York at Albany which was very apathetic to the students' plans. More than 150 freshmen and about 50 fraternity men took part in the fast on Friday noon. The majority of fraternity men were from Phi Epsilon Pi. Money obtained from the fast, near- ly $100, will be divided between the Carver Community Center and the Schenectady Area Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Viet Nam. In the first afternoon session con- cerning Viet Nam, Prof. Donald Thurston of the history department spoke on \Misconceptions Concerning Asia.\ Thurston's view was liberal thought not radical, and he adopted many ideas of Ambassador Reisch- auer, the former ambassador to Japan. The Rev. Lloyd Duren of the Sche- nectady Area Clergy and Laymen Concerned About VietNam compared Viet Nam to Picasso's \Guernica\ in his talk. In the session on the racial crisis, Ralph Boyd of the Schenectady NAA- CP spoke on the \Economic Condi- tion of Black America\ while Le<1n Van Dyke from the Brothers t~lked about \Peace Freedom, and SimcEr- ity.\ Boyd charged that there was eco- nomic discrimination against t:he Ne- gro and Van Dyke questioned the sin- cerity of the white community irt try- ing to help Negroes. Their p«>ints raised many questions from the ;~udi­ ence which were forcefully answered. Kokot stated that although tbe p-er- centage turn-out at Union was s:mall, Ph.D. Needed Associate professors need a Ph.D. or equivalent degree, such as M.D., Sc.D., Ed.D., D.Engin., or sufficient art .training in their field of com- petence and a record of outstanding performance as a teacher, recognized scholarship, and service to the Col- lege. L~~fi D~~Pw~~~~s. R~~~~~~~sh',~o~~•tiJ Although the win was a big one with the other joining the first mid die ·- i I .. , To become a full professor one must have a doctorate level degree, ten years as a competent teacher or serv- ice in professional work, and recog- nized scholarship, through publication, national position, or grants and fel- lowships. Promotion from one rank to an- other begins with the recommendation of the Department Chairman based upon the candidate's record since his last promotion or hiring, 'J'he Faculty Advisory Committee, various Deans, and the President consider the teach· ing effectiveness and professional achievement (criteria thought comple· mentary at Union), services to the College, and the relevance of the candidate's field to the goals of the College. Time in rank is not an arbi- trary factor in determininJ! promo· tions. Tenure, or permanent appointment, also begins with the recommendation of the Department Chairman to the Dean of the center. Faculty, the Fac- ulty Advisory Committee, the Deans, the President, and relevant outsiders are consulted. Teaching ability, re- search activity, service to the College, and contributions to the goals of the institution are reviewed. Tenure is not granted without the candidate having obtained a doctorate dei!ree. Furthermore. the candidate must have 7 years of full time teaching at Union College and rank of associate pro- fessor, or 4 years full time teachin,g here, rank of associate professor, and more than 3 years of full time em- ployment at an accredited institution of higher learning. Appointment as a full professor or two appointments as an associate professor confers au· tomatic tenure. Moral Twpitude A teacher on tenure may be fired in certain instances. The discontinu· ence of the subject or department Hustling and stickhandling made the difference as the lacrosse team put together three goals in less than four minutes to defeat hard-hitting Colgate, 9-8. They host Hamilton to- day at 2:30< on Daley Field, and hope to up their record to 6-1. Sam Dill was the big gun for the Garnet offense, scoring three goals and assisting on one other, while Lee Schneider scored one himself, and 39 Aspire To Lead A campus-wide primary Wednesday will narrow a list of 39 students as- pirinK to become class officers next year down to 24 or less for the final election Thursday.

All freshmen will cast their ballots in West College Lounge between 5:30 and 7:30 p.m. They will vote for one of six candidates who have signed up for president, four for vice-presi- dent and two each for secretary and treasurer. The members of the Class of '71 who picked up petitions for president are Andy Lask, Don Kessler, Bill Dawson, Chuck Lakin, Dan Copans and Bill Perlstein. No less than seven sophomores are contending for presidency of that class. They are Ira Rutkow, Ted Stein- put, Mike Fischman, Robert Lange, Ed B u z a k, Mike Martell and Ian Biggi. Craig Baumer and Larey Pedowitz, an absentee candidate now schooling in Scotland, are running for president of the class of '69.

He most likely will ski, still intact from the begiiJning miss the rest of the season. of the season. Dill opened the scoring late in the first stanza with an assist from Rit- terbush, but Colgate then hit the nets three times in succession, to take a 3-1 lead early in the second period. Lee Schneider's brother, Paul, was in- strumental in the Colgate rally, scor- ing once and assisting on the other two. Lee then countered with an un- assisted goal of his own, and Jim O'Neil tallied on a \man up\ situa- tion to knot the score at 3-3. Colgate then sandwiched two goals around a score by Co-captain Ken Milne, w h o w a s assisted by Tad Knight. This put the halftime score at 5-4, in favor of the visitors. A total of seventeen penalties were incurred in the first half. Bruce Westby opened the second half scoring before a minute had gone by, with an assist from Schneider. However, a goal by the Red Raiders gave them the lead again, at 6-5. After a long dry spell for both clubs, the Garnet unleashed four consecutive scores to decide the game. Dill tied it at 6-6 very late in the third period, and halfway through the fourth he scored again to give Union the lead it never relinquishd. Middie John Rockwell pushed the score to 8-6 two minutes later, and Bob Seefried had the final goal on a long · shot with only three minutes to play. Colgate inched wifuin two with just over two minutes to play, and then the Garnet incurred two penalties al- most simultaneously' to put them two men down: With this great advantage Colgate scored once more, and the Union lead was only 9-8. However a final scoring threat was averted as goalie Ken Auerbach came up with ·a low Colgate shot, killed almost ten seconds, and then gqt off a pass which ended the contest.

The statement read \We Presidents of Student Government and Editors of campus newspapers at more than 500 American colleges believe we s~ould not be forced to fight in the VIetnam War because the Vietnam War is unjust and immoral.\ Following the statement, the names of all the colleges where a student leader signed the statement was list- ed in alphabetical order with the stu- dent signers' name and position un- derneath.

But before action could be taken on the issue, Dr. Martin said, \people must know what the relevant information is.\ He said that the administration and faculty had been taking action on recruiting more Negro stu· dents for Union \for well over two years.\ But he pointed out that thts year fewer Negroes ap- plied to Union than last year, when the college had accepted 2::>0 per cent more than carne. \1hey may have had oppor- tumties elsewhere, the scno1ar- sn1p otters may nave been larger elsewhere or tney may have chosen another Institution over Umon,\ .ur. martm said m ex- pJammg the situation. But he noted tnat Umon has propor- twnately a larger number of Negroes than :,L 1 NY at Albany. Dr. !Vlartm c1ted the possibil- ity of recru1tmg m .!.\Jew York C1ty for .l'iegro students, al- though he sa1d that students there tend to regard Umon as an engmeermg school. lie also said possible deterrmg factors at Umon were that 1t was not coeducational and that there are not enough ~egroes here at present to make it attractive tor other Negroes. Dr. Martin also said in ap- praising the alternatives open to the college itself in recrmtmg Negroes that Leon Van Dyke had been correct in stating Fri- day that, \the people in the in- stitutiOn should be workmg to help Negro people get an edu- catiOn so they can qualify for admittance into places like Union.\ Dr. Martin cited the Upward Bound program as a step in this direction. Dr .. Martin said that -there was a need for the college to \get everybody to understand what the data are about ourselves and the problem in general.

Miss Parker states that she has found that \under this new system instead of ALL C stud- ents trying to talk their way to a B, only C-plus students! would make the eftort.\ I sm- cerely sympathize with Miss Parker if ALL her C students try to talk their way to a B. This might imply cer:tain fraili- ties in either her own marking system or in her relationship with her students. Miss Parker also fails to consider how many C students will try to talk their way to a C·plus, or how many C-rninus students will try to talk their way to a C, ad in- nmtum throughout this propos- ed system. I also believe the proposed system would involve hair-Sl'Jlit- tmg when considered for more than one paper or test. While it is very true that there exio;;ts a difference between a B-plus dnd a B paper, try to cons1der the fine line of distinction in- volved when we carry this dif- ference in trying to' compute a total term mark for three or four papers combined with one or two tests. 'There is definitely a difference between a B-plus and a B-minus, but is there any real appreciable dif- ference between a B-minus and a C-plus when considered for ten weeks work? I would sug- gest this difference t() negligi- ble if not totally non-existent. The r;ossible conciliation be- tween the two marking systems may lie in an eight-point mark- ing scale, which would elimin- ate a system of A, B-plus, B, C- plus, etc. This compromise sys- tem would appear more plausib:e as it would eliminate SOME of the hair-splitting and active \browning\ on the part of stud- ents.

At every . flash of thigh or suggestion of · carnal activities, the ejaculations of laughter drowned out the next ten lines of dialogu·e. Not that there wasn't any- thing humorous about the movie, there was. But much was pathetic and all was important. (And most were 'laughing for the wrong reasons at the wrong times.) Behind the movie's sex- ual facade was apparent the rotten core of the American ill- ness, from the placid uninvolved lookers-on in the subway car, to the confused Negro who had covered his identity with his ' 1 . Brooks Brothers suit. But most of the Union men didn't look this far, for they were satisfied with the sexual facade. There was trouble with the sound system, making it diffi- cult enough to hear- without all the laughing, but there seemed to be more trouble with some of the heads in attendance, and that· is a problem less easily col!rected. I guess it should have been expected, for how else does one get vicai,ious satisfac- tion on a lonely Thursday night? But this is just one example. There's more and it's all re- lated. I Tears ... . 'fhe Scene: A dorm, after the girl has just been raped on news has gotten around that a campus. Three students sit up- set and bewildered that such a thing could have happened. They talk of the brutality and the inhumanity of it. One thinks of his girlfriend and how he would react if it happened to her. Tears talk for him, tears he~s unashamed of. All are quiet, thinking of some way they could help the girl.

Maybe a Union man didn't rape that girl, hut, man, most of them are probably only sorry that they didn't get a chance to watch. So, why is it like this and what do we do? For one thing, in 200 years they will look back at all male schools like we look at the monastaries of the Middle Ages (who knows, perhaps we will be lumped into the Middle Ages.) So, get girls here quick. Only when girls become part of the everyday environment will they be accepted and treated as people to whom you must relate fuHy, and not just as things. Maybe then Union men will learn that the breasts are on the girl, and not that incidentally there is a girl attached to tl:te breasts. And maybe they'll lear-11 that sex is much better when it is part of a full relatioEship. And get rid of the damn soc· ial rules. It is not the emphasis on sex that is the problem, it it the orientation .of the ernpha sis. Sex is not seen as a11 mte' grated part of the relationship. \Screw 'em and leave 'em\ an<l• the idea that \sex is all that givls are good for\ are the phi- losophies that abound.

Editor Signs On Page 1 Conc9rdy Sports Ultimate Experience Page 1-4 Turner Sets Record; Runners Fall 90-54 By HENRY FEIN 'The Garnet track team drop- ped its third decision in four meets Saturday, falling to RP 1 90-54. The frosh now stand at 1·2, as they also lost to the Engineers, 78-67. Al Sessoms, Art McCabe and Fitz Turner turned in outstand· ing individual performances for the varsity. Sessoms took the 220 in 22.0 and the 440 in 51.1, both against strong RPI opposi· tion. Al helped provide some fireworks in the 440 relay, as he pulled away from his Engi- neer foe on the anchor leg to score a five-yard victory. The time over the soft track was 43.9. Sessoms also anchored the mile relay to victory in ~:27.6. frosh Laxmen Fall To Red Raiders 10-6 By JAY BLITZMAN Union's freshman lacrosse team entertained Colgate Satur- day and suffered their third consecutive loss, 10-6. In the early stages of the first period, Colgate controlled the tempo of the game, until the Garnet midfield began to take charge. With barely five min· utes gone in the contest, Wayne Christie converted a Bruce Du· gan pass goal for the game's mitial marker. Colgate rallied quickly, however, taking a 2·1 lead at the end of the first period. Fitz Turner smashed the Gar- net all-time high jump record, as he cleared 6' 2 3 8\. Mc- Cabe, who has now scored 5714 points in four meets, posted fifteen of them Saturday. Art took .first place in the triple jump with a leap of 42' 9\ ran a leg of the mile relay in place of the injured Pete Ericson, fin.- ished second in the leng jump at 20' 5 1 4 \ and scored third place in the high jump and high hurdles. Carl Thurn won his fourth straight 880, as he triumphed in 1:59.2. Mike Michalski fin- ished second in the high hur- dles, as did George Gardner in the shot put, Ed Blechner in the discus, and Tom Oberst in the javelin. Once again, Terry McMannus was the star of the frosh meet, as he won the 880 in 2:05, the mile in 4:44.6, and the triple jump with a 39' 2\ leap. Joe Burgess looked to be returning to his top cross-country form, as he coasted home second in the mile, and then easily cap- tured the two-mile in 10:42.1. Paul Elliot won the high hur- dles in 18.3, and Steve MacKen- zie took the 440 intermediate hurdles in 64.5. Bill Bush leap- ed 18' 914\ on the final jump of the afternoon to capture the long jump by three-quarters of an inch from John Kimball of HPI. Both the varsity and the frosh have the week off, and resume competition Saturday. The varsity will travel to Mid- dlebury, while the frosh will compete in the Cobleskill Invi- tationals. Goll Wins Two, Falls to Siena By JOHN DENEFRIG The golf squad defeated St. John-Fisher and Hobart in an opening meet Friday by the identical score of 5·1 but dropped its record to 2-1 ' yesterday with a 5-2 loss to highly touted Siena. In Fri- day's match, John Hine, Walt Blum. and Rich Critchlow led the t e a m with double wins. Doug Vergith and Rich Horsman :both had a victory and a tie while Dick Adams · won his match against his St. John-Fisher opponent. · Vergith, Blum, Hine, and Critchlow all had the same low medal score of 76 with . Horsman adding a 78 and Adams an 81. John Hine kept his record perfect with a 5-3 victory over Callahan of Siena and Jeff Smith won his match over Getman 3-2 in a fine losing effort yesterday. The match was quite close, with both Ward Blum and Rich Critchlow being edged by the identical score of 1-up. Wins in these key matches could have turned defeat in vic· tory against the best dual meet competition the Bob · Leonard coached golfers wiN meet this season.

' According to Coach Benson, the team \looked tight\ during the first sets of the Rochester match, but began to loosen up as the battle progressed.

Olton. The proposition was shelved and then later reviewed by a com- mittee headed by Steve Ritterbush and including Gerald Grau and pro- fessor William Bristol. Student Survey a 2.7 The ICAC. and edition an 8-0 the ri. ity in ees. I I The Student Council supported its i proposition with a student swvey and obtained over 700 signatures showing that 72% of Union students were in favor of releasing the requirement. These results were questioned by the All College Council. Grady Aronstamm, president of the Student Council stated, \It does not look as though there will be an aboli- tion of the requirement. We are hop- ing for a renovated program, how- ever.\ Proposals Other points in the Student Coun- cil's proposals include (1) only having three speakers per term to keep the caliber high, (2) a grant-in-aid writ- ing a short paper on the speaker to • be posted in dormitories and fratern- ities, (3) to hold convocations by less appealing speakers in SS 016. Dean Olton, presently acting as the · convocation committee member re- sponsible for the selection of the speakers, wishes to make the program more relevant to the student needs and hopes, and, where possible, to tie it in with the curriculum. Suggestions Welcome Realizing his personal prejudices towards social sciences and his lack of knowledge of good scientific speakers, the Dean invites any stu- dent or member of the faculty to suggest speakers they are interested in. Within the next month the g~n­ eral format of next years convocation • schedule will be discussed. $40,090 Raised In Compus Drive A new stage of the college's Capital Fund Drive to raise $12.5 million by 1970 began yesterday with the active solicitation of gifts and pledges from .. I:• faculty, administration and staff. I $40,000 Received The campus drive is scheduled to run until Thursday, April 11th. Twen- ty-six pledges totaling $40,000 have already been received. About $4 mil- '' lion of the projected $12.5 million has already been collected by the cam- paign. A fund raising effort is soon to begin in Schenectady. Constructs New Center The capus drive was officiaUy op- ,, ened at a luncheon meeting in Hale House, Thursday, April 4th, Faculty, administration and staff were urged to contribute to the present college t• resources. The total $12.5 million will be used to construct a new Science and Engi· neering center, additions to the li- t.? brary and heating plant ·along with other construction. The Campus Drive is directed by a , steering committee headed by Calvin · Schmidt, the Registrar, and Physics Professor Charles Swartz. SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK, FRIDAY, APRIL 5, 1968 College's efforts to prevent another collapse Ceiling Collapses,~ Dorms Reinforced The concrete ceiling over the entry way into Davidson House outside of Dean Lucas's apart- ment collapsed suddenly at 11 P.M., March 22. No one was hurt in the accident. Lucas reported that he was in his apartment in Davidson when he heard a thunderous noise. He could not immediately determine the cause. A few minutes later he was leaving the dorm, and found that the doorway was blocked by the fallen ceiling. Lucas speculated that the sup- porting pins in the concrete which hold the ceiling up must have pulled loose. He said the construction company has been on campus and is testing other entry way ceilings to determine if they are weak. Meanwhile wooden beams on hydraulic jacks are holding up all entry way ceilings around Davidson and Fox. Concordy Appears Twro Tintes Every Week For the first time since before World War If, Concordiensis will be pub- lished twice per week. In announcing the expanded service, Editor-in-Chief Richard E. Patterson, Jr. said he felt that the twice weekly format will enable Concordy to take \a large step toward becoming a more effective newspaper.\ Under the new schedule th.e newspaper will be published in two four page editions on Tuesday and Friday of each week.

This new policy was recently adopted by the All College Council. Specifically, student parking will not be permitted in the lots around the library, the Biology, Chemistry, and Physics Buildings, Carnegie Hall, the Electrical Engineering building, Old Gym, Old Chapel, the administra- tion building, Wells House 1 VITA, or behind Alumni gym. Parking is also prohibited on all roadways or un- paved areas. Faculty and staff will park in lots by academic and ad- ministration buildings. Vigorous Enforcement Campus police will issue tickets in strict enforcement of the regulations. Fines will range from $1.00 for the first offense to $5.00 for third and subsequent offenses, and must be paid at Student Activities Office within one week. Twenty M.P.H. Previous regulations such as re- quired registration of all vehicles, a twenty mile per hour speed limit, no motorcycles on campus, and no cars for freshman as well as those re- ceiving financial aid were reaffirmed. The Inter-Fraternity Council has passed its motion providing iden- tification cards for fraternity men enabli:sg fraternities to close their parties if they so desire. Although the motion was passed at a meet- ing held at the end of last term, I.F.C. President Dick Amesbury emphasized that this does not mean that all parties will be closed to non-fraternity men. da~\ in philo>ophy with tlu: ~tudent threl' years ago.

Cancelled Rally Draws Crowd More than 50 students assembled Thursday in Social Science 016 for a Union Students For McCarthy Meet- ing that wasn't. No one knew who called the meeting or who cancelled it, but they knew representatives from McCarthy headquarters in Sche- nectady never showed up. That a McCarthy supporter had called the meeting was unquestionable but who cancelled the meeting re- mained a puzzle. Someone suggested that \only a Kennedy supporter could have done it.\ The support was not wasted, how- ever, when Steven Glanzrock, leader of a McCarth.y poster and bumper sticker fund·raising campaign that raised $45 during registration, took charge of the \cancelled meeting\ and immediately called another meet- ing for Monday night, 7:30 p.m., in ss 016. He hopes to support Time Maga- zine's Choice '68, hold election of officers, plan a weekend rally, and coordinate Union supporters with the <'ity-wide effort at Monday's meeting. A representative from McCarthy Headquarters in Albany will speak at the meeting. be Monday afternoon (for the Tues- day issue) and Thursday afternoon (for the Friday issue). In the past, the paper h!ls usually published one eight-page issae per week, so news coverage will not be substantially increased, due to a lack of funds. Stickmen Face Alumni Sat. Patterson noted, however, that pub- lishing bi-weekly will mean that the news in the paper will still be news when it hits campus. Also, he said, \the rigor of publishing twice vveekly will require our staff to be more professional.\ Techniques A!tercd Neil Kramer, managing editor, noted that the change of format has forced many modifications of Con- cordy's production techniques. \We are cutting out much of the time budgeted for proof reading and de· pending more upon our printers.\ It is planned that weekend sports will get major coverage in the Tues- day issue, and the Friday issue will concentrate on the news of the week. Mann's Initiative Joe Mann, who preceded Patterson as Editor of Concordy~ was the first to make preparation tor the return to twice-weekly publication. It took about five months, however, for new production procedures to be form- ulated. Patterson said that since most of the staff is comprised of freshmen and sophomores, \We are not stifled by the inertia of people who are stu<'k in the rut of publishing once a week,\ and that this is the best time to adapt to a new publishing schedule. By LEN SIMON It should be a banner year for la- crosse, but pre-season performances have not yet proved that. Coach Bruce Allison has many returnees from last year's fine 8-2 team, but is. also rely- ing on untested sophomores, especial- l.:y on defense. Also, the schedule has been toughened up with the addition of Syracuse and Colgate. The tick- men close out the exhibition season with the Alumni game Saturday at 2, and open regular season competition Wednesday, hosting Middlebury. One asset the team can certainly boast of is a high powered attack. Seniors Lee Schneider and Steve Rit- terbush will be starting for their tllird season. These two slick shoot- ers have combined for 82 goals and B2 assists in two seasons, with Schnei- der holding a slight advantage in each department. Scoring punch should be one thing the stickmen will not lack. Joining these two will be junior Bruce Westby, who got some varsity experience last season as an often used substitute. This year Allison expects to run four midfield lines, showing more depth than he has had in the past. This will allow the players to be fresh and hustling, partly balancing off the fact that many of them have little or no varsity experience. Sen- ior Ken Milne, who co-captains the team along with Ritterbush 1 heads the first midfield line, combming with senior Jim O'Neil and sophomore Doug Duval. Milne has scored 20 -Daniel Ken Milne and Steve Ritterbush Co-Captains of Varsity Lacrosse goals in two seasons, is an excellent playmaker and stickhandler, and plays a rugged defense. The second middie line consists of seniors Tad Knight, Bob Seefried and Mike Walsh. They should excell on defense, as their hitting and hustle will stand out. Backing them up will ----- be a third line made up of senior Sam Dill, junior Pete Brittin, and soph Steve Bauer. Dill, who started on at- tack is the only one with considerable game experience. He scored twelve goals last season in his first year of competition in the sport. Sophomores Rich Swan, Jim Sabella, and Continued on Page 4

2 Friday, April 5, 1968 Letters· to the Editor It's Academic To the Editor: I am left somewhat bemused by your editorial \Freedom For All\. You begin by commending the Discipline Committee and the Administration for a .posi· tion they have taken in regard to student demonstrations and you then proceed to reprove, m the name of \academic free· dom,\ anyone who would refuse to allow students \to carry 0n a dialogue with a recruiter from Dow Chemical Co.\ In turning to the front page of the same issue of Concordiensis one learns that various members of the college administration, staff, and police \manned the locked doors and successfully kept out the quiet and orderly demon· strators.\ Are you suggesting that this action represents a way of promoting \academic freedom\ by allowing students to carry on a dialogue? Such behavior on the part of the College, whether or not it has anything to do with academic freedom, is most obviously an expression (per haps justified) of paternalism. obstructed students and faculty from carrying on a dialogue with him would have certainly been to violate the principles of academic freedom, ours and his. Fortunately that did not happen and his visit turned out to be much more than the chance to get a convocation credit. How- ever can Ginsberg's appearance at Union be compared with the appearance of the representa- tive from Dow as far as the question of academic freedom is concerned? This seems dubious to me. After all the latter's primary if not sole aim in com- ing to the campus is to conduct interviews for the purpose ef recruiting young men to ·work for his company. It is not to speak his mind and to contrib- ute an interesting and possibly educative point of view. So I conclude that while I do not condone the behavior of those who would obstruct others from being interviewed or from en- tering into a dialogue with the Dow recruiter I fail to see how this raises the issue of academic freedom. MICHAEL J. FOSTER A Glance Askance A question which might have something to do with academic freedom is raised in your edi· torial but I am not impressed by your argument. Let me say first that you seem to go out of your way to stigmatize Allen Ginsberg's visit to the campus To the Editor: by implying or, I should say, asserting that he spent two days I understand that the Student here \preaching the use of Council will soon sponsor a poll LSD.\ This is a distortion if to determine student sentiment not simply a lie. Besides provid- on Convocation credits. If this ing us with a convocation dou- referendum shows, as many bleheader of poetry and man- claim it will, that students op- tras he was generous with his pose continuation of the present time in other ways, provoking credit system, and, if the All a great deal of discussion and College Council acts in accord- controversy with his thoughts ance with this finding, one im- on poetry, politics, religion, portant aspect of Union's cui- drugs, sex, and many other tural life will be drastically at- topics. You would agree that tered. I have not made up my for anyone to have prevented mind about the merits of the him from speaking or to have Council's proposal, but I would ~==~.~~~-=~~--~~~ like to explain some of the dis- advantages of a non-compulsory Convocation Series. The primary effect (no one seems to dispute this) would be a sharp decline in Convocation attendance, except for \head- line attractions.\ Surely the Chapel would still be filled fer the Arthur Schlesingers and the Allen Ginsbergs; but would we be able to assemble a respect- able audience for a Michael Harrington, a Clark Kerr, or a B. F. Skinner? The three speak- ers I have named (they are merely examples) are all nation- ally prominent men and all have a great deal to say; yet they are not well known to many undergraduates, and thus attendance at their lectures might be insultingly low. With- out compulsory credits, there- fore, our community would not be exp0sed to many important men and ideas. I do not believe that Union College's present Convocation system is ideal. In fact, I am very unhappy with many as- pects of it. We must re-think both the eads and the means of the program, and therefore I am glad to see students begin- ning a reassessment. On the other hand, I think we should not alter the system Vlithout long and careful thought. We presently have a very rich Con- vocation program; it would be a shame to exchange it for a barren one. CHARLES S. 6LTON Acting Dean of Students Orgy-Porg:v To the Editor: The J!ecent structural diffi- culties in Davidson and Fox Halls have overshadowed the widely spread rumor that some fraternities and independents there have requested firmer mattresses aml bed boards. It appears that Union's sagging so- cial rules, finally revised last year, have put a significant strain upon both the seat of somnaml>ulism and the roomate in the lower bed. I also look askance at the movement to abandon Convoca- tion credits because I know that students, like most people, are lazy. If someone tells them they must attend a certain number of cultural events, they will do it, and often be enriched by the experience. Without some form of compulsion, however, extra- curricular intellectual life may be irreparably damaged. I note with some curiosity that the Student Council's proposal to The hypocrisies of our social alter the credit system uses rules are unsurprising, for they exactly this rationale when it prepare us for tbe later hypoc- requires freshmen to attend pro- risies of law, business, govern- grams; I disagree with the im- ment, and most other areas of plication that upperclassmen are future coacern. What is sur- more mature and energetic in- prising is the collective nature tellectually than freshmen. of our licentiousness. The fra- --------~----------------- ternit:y, a case in point, more so than the independent dorm, finds the height of its social intercourse within the structure of the Dionysian and satyr like confluence of the beer party. Can anyone who has convulsed himself schizophrenically to the high vibrational twang of an electric guitar emanating from an amplifier just a few feet away deny that the feeling of release, of a breakout, is in fact the emergence of some primi- tive coHective force, o0zing from the unknown within, released at last from the genes in which it was locked eons ago, even be- fore the thcmsand year old brew mastel'. The Union boy is no longer content with grossing his date out in private, better to be wit- nessed by ones suiternates or frater11ity brothers in a tribal setting. Sex has slowly been transformed into a community hap:pening. The distinction be- tween. intimate sex and osten- tativlls grossness is narrowing. Those who attended the abortive winter weekend concert saw evi- dence .of this. What is the pur- pose of an intimate relationship if oth.ers know of its intimacy? Our coveting of studliness and our loss of individual identity to achieve it and wear it well through the mass material media of the playboy ethic have led us to this state. On ,its nature, good or bad, one must reserve personal judgement. What we have found here is the failure of foresight· edness in a college administra- tion that constructs dormitories with :four man suites with mat- tresses made to support but one frail chap while contemplating a sweeping social change. The competition to achieve the heights of studliness under these conditions is obvious. One can but hope that in the con- struction of our new student center some farsighted and broadly schooled architect wiU include i.n the plan small stra- tegically located cubicles where libidineus impulses between a censenting couple may be re- leased in the intimacy of a private cinder block room vi- brating to the soft strains of WRUC. The pressure to per- form sexual gymnastics might be lessened. Why, the existence of such an ideal: may perhaps be responsible for the decline in our frantic pursuit of the moon, just as synthetic textiles ended the cult of the beaver over a century ago. Were the present social re- strictions to lapse entirely, ac- cepting the reality of the situa- tion, the present conditions would be relieved, since the risk and intrigue would be de- stroyed, negating the studly factor and ultimately solving) the mattress financial gap. And that's how I see things from here, fornicating on the roof of the memorial. A. RUSSELL JACOBS Published Tuesday and Friday during the school year by the Student Body of Union College.

(MILWAUKEE)-The \Chil- dren's Crusade\ of Senator Eu- gene McCarthy comes as close to total anarchy as any organiz- ation can and yet still function. The total paid staff responsible for the coordination of 8000 weekend volunteers consisted of five people. While the paid organization is small, the entire staff working from the Hotel Wisconsin to- tals 80 staffers, most tempor- ary dropouts from schools as far afield as Yale, Wellesley, and the University of Illinois. So much has to be done that it is not unusual for yesterdays . envelope stuffers to be in charge of volunteer coordirra- tion tomorrow.

He explained that much of the work at IBM is solving problems. So if you have a logical mind, you could go into areas like programming or market- ing. Both of which are in the hea1·t of IBM's business. \M:y job is helping banks use computers. Which isn't nearly as technical as it sounds. You deal with people a lot more than with machines. \At first, the idea of sales appalled me. You know, you think .ofWniy Loman and so on. But marketing at IBM is entirely different. You're a pl'oblem solver. You have to come up with new solutions for every customer. \'I guess that's what makes the job so inte1·esting. That and the level of people you deal with.

Vol. 97- As of the close of the winter term, Beta Theta Pi has a sub- stantial lead in the overall in- tramural championship stand- ings. The point totals read as follows: 1 Beta Theta Pi 627.- 241 - 2 Delta Phi 584.756- 3 Delta Upsilon 575.226 - 4 Delta Chi 572.674 - 5 Independents 565.013 - 6 Phi Sigma Delta 536.103 - 7 Chi Psi 508.870 - 8 Phi Epsilon Pi 508.419 - 9 Theta Delta Chi 481.776 - 10 Phi Gamma Delta 462.980 - 11 Phi Delta Theta 452.100 - 12 Alpha Delta Phi 388.072 - 13 Sigma Phi 382:006 - 14 Phi Sigma Kappa 375.130 - 15 Kap- pa Alpha 373.970 - 16 Sigma Chi 309.500 - 17 Psi Upsilon 187.195. The swimming meet, to be held this coming Tuesday and Wednesday, is the next competition, with Psi Upsilon likely to sweep up the team hon- ors easily. The softball season begins next Thursday; the pre- season favorites are Phi Sigma Delta and Delta Upsilon in the National League and Delta Phi and Phi Epsilon Pi in the Amer- ican. The last competition is the spring outdoor track meet, to be scheduled sometime in May; off the strength of their indoor performance, Chi Psi looks to be the team to beat in track. Beta Theta Pi were the repeat champs of basketball. Led by Bob Seefried, they defeated Del- ta Upsilon in a battle of un- beatens in the last week of the season to get to the champion- ship finals. Delta Phi easily won the other berth in the finals. In the finals, Jim Wilson and Joe Douglas led a Delta Phi rally from a nine point deficit into the lead against a Beta team in serious foul trouble, only to lose by one point on a basket by Phil Foley with one second remaining. In intramural handball, the In- dependents team, composed of Dave Ordon in singles and Ralph Marks and Wayne Brant- ley in doubles, wiped out the Delta Upsilon team of Jim Sa- bella and Greg Oneglia to com- plete a perfect undefeated sea- son and take the championship. Beta Theta Pi was also a threat, finishing a close second behind Delta Upsilon in their league. At the intraural track meet, Chi Psi was overpowering. Their 41 point total easily beat second place Delta Upsilon's 22 and third place Independents 21. In- dividual winners for Chi Psi were Rich Swan with 6.0 in the 50 yard dash, Steve Ciesinski with 18'6\ in the long jump, and Larry Relyea with 42'3\ in the shot put. Dick Theokas of Delta Chi won the 55 yard low hurdles with a time of 7.6. Chi Psi was also strong in the relays; Duffy, Caruso, Wall, and Goth took the distance relay, and then Duffy, Moffit, Chizzonitti, and Goth fol- lowed with the medley relay. The Independents team of Hath- away. White, Fishman, and The intramural bowling cham- pionship was won again by Del- ta Chi on the strength of an outstanding performance in the finals against the Independents. Greg Ellis rolled a 234-653 to lead Delta Chi. Doll Hovey won the all-col- lege singles bowling tourna- ment, and then proceeded to flunk out of school. Hovey de- feated AI Case 182-150 in the semi-finals while Greg Ellis was beating Paul Gerber 203.172; then in the finals Hovey rolled past Ellis 214-180 by striking out in the last two frames. In an intramural basketball league composed by the Inde- pendents, Turkey Team 4 led by the scoring of Dave Potter, Pete Hathaway. and Frank Glenn won the season champion- ship and then lost the playoff title to Team # 3, led by Kent Kraft, Geoff Davenport, Jesse Dawkins, and Henry Smith.

The defense is led by re- turning starter Larry Gillette, a senior. Gillette was a standout last season, possessing both strength and quickness, and will have to anchor an otherwise in- experienced defense this season. Also slated to start are junior Steve Herrick and soph Ron Wall. At the present time both Gillette and Wall are nursing slight injuries, and soph Kevin ;\ionahan and junior Sandy Swope are slated to see much action if they are not ready. Returning to the nets will be starting goalie Ken Auerbach, a senior who made 96 saves last season, while allowing only 45 goals. He is backed up by jun- ior Andy Bittner. The biggest hurdle of the season for the Garnet could be getting by the first two con- tests. A scrimmage with Siena Wednesday showed that the team still has a long way to go, especially on defense. The pass- ing was not sharp, the checking was ineffective, and hustle was lacking all over the field. Hope- fully Saturday's joust with the alumni will show improvement in these areas and will add greatly needed experience. Middlebury and Stevens, not the toughest opposition the stickmen will have to face, are by no means the easiest. They are both respectable foes, and will have game experience un- der their belts when they visit Schenectady. Should the Garnet get by these two, they should have no trouble up north taking on St. Lawrence and Clarkson, both weak links in the schedule. By that time, if their record is 4-0, the team should have gained the experience and con· fidence to take on the tough part of the schedule, including Syracuse, Colgate, Cortland, Ho- bart, and R.P.I.

ParticipaJtts would become involved in genuine creative thought which might improve the quality of life in the house. Again, the advantages of such a pr()gram would be manifold. Frater- nities would be bringing together so- cial and cultural life on our campus in a meaningful way; they would be contributing to the inter·collegiate relationships in this region; they would be giving Union College excel· lent local publicity; etc. On March 7, 11 and 13, President Martin and I met with small groups of fraternity presidents. Our purpose was to explore in d-etail some of the issues and proble~ns faced by the 1 houses. 'The President and I had ul- f ' terior motives for convening these meetings: we believe fraterniti~s •. · could be more relevant to academic and intellectual life at this college, and we were looking for opportun- ities to revitalize and redirect them. Moreover, we beliEve that individuals associated with fr-aternities would find their collegiate experience more satisfying and rewarding if their fra- ternal bonds were :firmly rooted in- . tellectually and culturally, as well as socially. While the fraternity presidents ap- peared to agree with our general goals, they quite legitimately won- dered how they might tak~ actio.n to implement them. It was w1th this m mind that I present-Ed a hypothetical program at each of the three meet- ings. One of the real problems with Union's present Convocation system is tnat there is very little genuine en· · thusiasm for it. I note, for example, that there is presently a movement afoot to abolish the .compulsory credit · system. Perhaps the best way to gen· · erate interest in non-compulsory Con- vocations would be to develop more intense and multi-dimensional pro· grams. Consider, fo~ example, a 'Yeek· long Convocation Frogram entitled, Another possibility which I present.· ed at one of the meetings is a cam_· pus symposium. I have seen a :poro - gram of this kind work successfu:ll:w in another fraternity system simjlal\ to Union's. Two or more sponsoring houses might invite four of our fac:ul· ty members to deliver papers on:; a topic agreed upon in advance. 'I'he topic might be a political or mo1aJ problem in which college stude11ts are directly involved, or it might be an imaginative subject which wouJa. bring together faculty minds i11 var- ious academic disciplines. Two fac- ultypa pers might be presented oo each of two evenings, followed h~ formal, written critiques by stude11ts (not necessarily members of tbe- splln· so ring fraternity). A program of this kind would ptl'Oo· duce genuine faculty and student •illi.· ter·action outside the classro()m. 'Ehe intellectual spirit involved in sucb ~ project could not help but rub off mn the houses involved, as well as ih<E campus at large. _ Surely there are many more possi· ble programs of a similar nature. If any Union fraternity men have an in· terest in projects of this kind, I sug. gellt they begin discussion in their house meetings. I shall be more than pleased to get together with any groups, large or small, to carry dis· cussion further .

He attacked the moderate American as the worst enemy of civil rights and declared that Americans' desire for law and order overrides the real reason for them - justice and freedom. .

An ocganization :meeting of the campus service group will be held Thursday in Social Science 016 at 7:15 p.m. . Coach Coleooa:n the club's adVIsor, stated the clull's ideals: campus and community betterment, self-develop- ment leadersl1ip, and citizenship and fello~ship. He said there is a need for an organi:zation which can Pfl:!· mote pride in the campus and umfi· cation of the student body through service to the C()mmunity. In response t() appeals from Presi· dent Martin <utd other adrninistra· tion and facalty, Coleman said he hopes Circle K 'Will increase Union's prestige and stl\engthen the student body as a whole. All Union students are invited to join the club at Thursday's meeting. Under this arrangement, no student would be allowed in the pavillion unless he were a Union or Skidmore student •'el' a date. Top name bands would be provided every Friday and Saturday, and twice a year a famous rock group would play free for mern· bers. D'Andrea said he hoped that stu· dents would feel that this was \their place\. He said the building could be used anytime and would be open all winter. D'Andrea said that the only feasible way to make this ar- rangement was to have everyone (or no one) pay the membership fee.

Bt\:Sl~ESS: Don Kesslt•l', J>:>ff Dirn. 1\u;· Karlin. Jerry Levine, Fred Stern, Fraternities at Union have reached an important stage in which their future at Union will be largely decided. A challenge to the present fraternity system has gone out from the President and DeaN of .Students. What should be the fraternities answer? What the administration has done (and rightly so) is to r!hallenge the relevancy of t11e present fraternity system at Union to t:te modern educational process. Are the definite and valuable contributions to campus life which fraternities pnvide enough considering the deman.ds which students, faculty and administration make upon a college community? The social aspect of education is vital, but are not ho11ses missing great opportunities to enrich themselves intellectually and culturally by not taking such action.s as those suggested by Dean Olton's comments. Fraternities, sho-uld, we feel, set higher goals for themselves and ask m0re of themselves than they do at present. To have the reso\lrces of organization, manpower and ability which fraternities have and not to act raises the question of how might these resources be better used. It is at this point that those who scream \abolish fraternities\ find ears for their words. In reaching the higher goals set for thems-elves fra- ternities can contribute significantly to the general im- provement of the campus. This itself, is the best justifica- ti<Jn for their existence. Those fraternities who flourish hEre in the future will be those who make their mark on the life of the campus for the good. If, in the face of thos challenge to answer their critics fraternities refuse to act, criticism will no longer be needed. They will seal their own fate. The future of fratern- ities at Union is up to the fraternities themselves to make. It is regrettable that the movement to abolish convo- cation requirements has met with serious opposition in the AGC. The majority of the students and faculty on campus favor abolition of the \convo card\ system. There seems to be some fear that without .convo re- quirements prominent men (such as Michael Harrington, Clark Kerr and B. F. Skinner) would draw such small audiences as to be lost to the campus .. These three men do indeed have something to say and could draw insterested st11dents with sufficient publicity to· be put out before they cQme, informing the students of the speakers relevance. Comeordiensis and WRUC have always cooperated in pub- licising convos. The greater effort to publicize the convo sllould help answer the problem. In any event if a speaker is likely to only draw a few interested students, scheduling him in SS016 would provide a closer, more intimate (and less embarrassing) atmosphere of interested students with which the speaker would probably be more pleased. In keeping with the colleges' function of education, it should provide students with the knowledge and tools ,-\ith which to make the intelligent (uncoerced) choices re- quired of citizens of a free society_ The college would appear mu.ch truer to its goals if it quickly abolished convocation requirements. Also, we urge the Delphics whose unpleasant job of handling out the little cards would also be abolished, tQ ta.ke up the task of publicizing convocations so that stu- dents will have the information needed with which to make intelligent decisions as to whch programs to attend. It is time for the ACC to take its stand with other campus groups in favor of a more dignified, confident, and valuable (coercion-free) convocation program. Half way will not do. The time is here to completely do away with the affront to student dignity and intelligence that is re- ql:lired convocation.

Sunday evening March 31; Lyndon Johnson, in his own inimitable dull style, calmly shocked the nation and the world by an- nouncing, \I shall not seek and I will not accept the nomination of my party . . .\ The real causes behind President John- son's decision may never be known, but reporters and news analysts will probably go on speculating about Johnson's mo- tives for several weeks to come. January 31 of this year, Ken- nedy had stated his unwilling- ness to challenge the President's renomination \under any for- seeable circumstances.\ At that time, however, Kennedy did not foresee Eugene McCarthy's strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, and, after a quick but thorough reassess- ment of his position, he an- nounced his intentions of run- ning. His powerful political rna- chinery, his e:x:perience, his fam- ily name and his ~eneral sup- port among the natwn's liberals quickly made Kennedy a serious threat to the Johnson admin- istration_ Execution The first and most obvious possible influence on Johnson's decision was the entrance of Senator Robert F. Kennedy .into the Democratic presidential nomination race. As recently as But KEnnedy definitely weuld not have entered the race had not McCarthy first paved the way for •him.

Tuesday, April 9, 1948 You Know I Can't Continued from Page 2 vember 30 that he would chal- lenge Johnson in at 'least five of tne major primaries, he seem- ed very nonchalant and tHrhope- Iul about his political possibil- ities. ••1 don't know whether it will be politicat suicide,\ he joked at a press conference, \It wiH probably be more like an execution.\ .1\IIcCarthy had the promised support of such groups as SANE, the ADA, a disorgan· ized coalition of six or seven Senators appropriately called The Sisy:phus Club, the Cali· fornia Democratic Council and New York Reform Democratic chtbs ,and the widely scattered support of some businessmen, clergy and 0ther anti'-war fac- tions, but for the most ,part his campaign was loosely organized and his support too widely dis· tri!buted to be counted as effec- tive. At the time he announced his candidacy, McCm:thy even intimated he was wHling to step aside should Kennedy decide to run. But that was bef()re New Hampshire and Wisconsin - and now 1\icCarthy along with every<Jne else is viewmg his possrblllties with a great deal more optimism. So Johnson had powerful presidential contenders to deal with if he wanted to seek re· election. He Inlght have been able to handle .tt1chard Nixon alone, takmg the same tact oi prudent restra1nt that he d1d In the 1!164 electwn with Marry Goldwater. But the political in· fluence of lVlcCarthy and Ken· nedy rooked ommous. Johnson Quits But besides the rift in his party, Johnson had the problem of VIetnam. Protests had risen from negligible in 1965 to minor in 1966 to moderate for most of 1967 to finally major and unig- ' norable in later Hl67 and early 1968, as witnessed by the April 15 Spring Mobilization for Peace in San Francisco and New York, which drew 200,000 demonstra· tors, and the massive Pentagon protest in Washington last Oc· tober 21 following a full week of major anti-war demonstra· tions. Civil disobedience became in· volved as frustration and bit· terness grew. By this time re- spected journals sucll as The New York Times, The Saturday Evening Post, Life, Newsweek and The New Republic were in- dicating dissatisfaction over the handling of the war, and Arthur Schlesinger, John Kenneth Gal- braith, E d win Reischauer, George Kennan, Theodore Sor- enson, General James Gavin, Pope Paul VI, Bertrand Russell, Linus Pauling, Jean Paul Sar- tre and the late Martin Luther King were joining hte endless host of :prestigious individuals, including those in the Adminis- tration itself, many of which were on the Senate F()rei~n Re· lations Committee, in criticizing the war. Johnson's original tactic was to ignore the protests, untir- ingly asking that the nation seek unity and not encourage Hear You ... the enemy by voicing dispute over the war. But it soon be· came apparent this approach was ineffectual - the President had to face up to the reality that a growing number of Amer- icans, many of them very in- fluential, were against the hand· ling of the war - a war they blamed on him. In addition to his major prob· lems - party dissension and the Vietnam war - Johnson also bad innumerable domestic mat- ters which required his full at- tion. The threat of riots in the cities for the sumer of 1968 was very real, and he was ex- pected to do something about it. The budget was skyrocketing uncontrol'lably; he had to re- quest a tax increase which Con- gress disfavored; then propose a foreign travel tax which only exacerbated debate over the budget issue. Then he ran into the problem of the gold stand- ard, and by that time it seemed like an endless task before he could hope to consider the prob- lem of reelection. Hubert? Despite Lady Bird's statement that tne President had had it in mmd to qu1t in 1968 as early as three years ago, it now ap- pears that these people, events and problems were the real mo- tives behind Johnson's decision and he did in fact explain his reasons in these terms: the di- vision of the country and his inability to campaign while dealing with the problems fac- mg the nation, plus the reality of a powerful undercurrent of anti-war sentiment in the coun- try. But there is possible further behind-the-scenes planning with regard to Johnson's decision. Vice-President Hubert H. Hum- phrey is now in a position to carry on for Johnson. Still hold- ing great polical influence, the President could accept a draft if his peace :proposals turn out to be successful. But this possibil· ity is unlikely, if only from the standpoint of political integrity. Johnson, a man of strong will, has made his position clear; he has said he won't accept renom- ination, and he won't. But there is still Hubert. It is almost certain that Humphrey will rep· resent the Johnson interests in the future primaries and at Chicago. One thing is clear: Johnson's decision has cast the 1968 Presi· dential race in a totally new light; his bombing reduction and subsequent moves toward negotiations could conceivably end in a Vietnam settlemen.t, and, depending on what happens this summer, an emphasis on the domestic crises. Or if negotia· tions never materialize, it may mean that all the candidates - including Richard Nixon - will have to explicitly define their Vietnam platform. In either case, the candidates will be forced to clarify their platforms - which will make for a much mor.e lively and interesting 1968 presidential race.

To the Editor: It was a nice day in Schenec- tady Sunday, April 7. Nice for softball in the afternoon, la· crosse too. It was a nice day for driving ar0und in a convertible with the top down. Perhaps it was too pleasant to do home- work in the afternoon, but if one is to watch the Smothers Brothel'S and Mission Impossi- ble in the evening, one has to make sacrifices. 'The weather was also conducive to walking through the streets (not side- walks) of Schenectady. It was a nice day to march in a silent memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in honor of his ac- complishments and his dreams. I have always held Union to be a predominantly white lib· eral college. 1 still do. Typical, perhaps of many if not most of ~he institutes of higher learning m our country. Here we find boys and men who know how to enjoy a pleasant Sunday after- noon. We also find those who are very satisfied with the racial situation in Schenectady. They say don't demonstrate or start any trouble in Schenectady for there is no trouble in Schenec- tady They say if you want to demonstrate, go to Albany where there is trouble already, There is no trouble in the Mt. Pleasant section of Schenectady, just a little poverty. I guess I am just a born wor- rier. I worry about the attitudes of people in areas where there is just a little poverty. I worry about areas where there is much poverty as well. I went on the march from Memorial Chapel to City Hall Sunday afternoon. It was a very nice march, and we all sang \America the Beauti· ful'' on the steps of City Hall. When I say we, I mean the peo· ple of the Schenectady area, the other representatives of the stu- dent body, and myself. I recog- nized six other Union students, but since I do not know every- one here I'll make an estimate that perhaps 50 Union College students made it out of a pos- sible 1300. That makes about four per cent. I said before that I must he a born worrier. I am. I worry- also about the at- titudes of people who use a pleasant Sunday afternoon to play softball, lacrosse, drive around in convertibles with the tops down, watch the televised hockey game, do their work in order to be able to watch T.V., and who can't afford to sacrifice a half hour of their time toward the future of our nation, as well as the memory of one of its greatest sons. Michael Spencer '67 Kudos To the Editor: I suspect that many of Con· cordy's staff are alreay familiar with the subject of this letter. I am relating this incident for the benefit of those who are not fa- miliar with it and for the rest of the campus, which should be. It is also for the benefit of the other unmentioned Fraternities which have had the same exper· ience. For the better part of Winter Term Phi Sigma Kappa has re- ceived only a copy or two of Concordiensis, usually left in our back hall - pretty brave, huh! It finally came down to the 'point where we: received no copies of C()ncordy's last issue of the term. I called the Distri- bution Manager to inquire into the situation. He informed me that Phi Sigma Kappa received no C0ncordies because, (and I quote faithfully) \there have been various and sundry rumors that you don't read it.\ I promptly surmised that this poor fellow must be ignorant and disregarded in disbelief what I had heard. I then called the Editor of Concordiensis. He was was not in. I left a message for him. An hour later the Editor himself arrived in the rain to deliver our school newspaper. There has been a great deal of grumbling in the past, especi- ally by Fraternity men outside a certain group, over the state Of Concordy and its staff. Such an incident can only further alienate the student from his school newspaper.

Questionable Hitting Holds Key \If our hitting can come through, I think we'll have a better than average season.\ Coach Lawrence's comment sums up the expectation of the 1968 Garnet baseball squad quite wel'l. With three returning starting pitchers, senior Bob Hallenback and juniors Bill Neidel and Joe Douglas :Lawrence has an ex- tremely' capable pitching st~ff. but hitting is a large quest10n mark. Only two of last year's starters graduated, bt~t those two, Greg Olson and Brll Toth, were the Garnet's only two .300 hitters. The six returnees, not counting pitchers who may hold down a starting spot, had a com- posite awrage of .only .231 last season. Heading the pitching staff. Hallenbeck had a fine 1.66 earn- ed run average, but poor de- fense (20 unearned runs) re- sulted in a 4-3 record for the southpaw in 1967. Doug~as .had a 2.43 ERA in twenty mnmgs p1tched, including on~ cornpl.ete- game victory last sprmg. N eld.el was a mainstay of the staff m the 1966 sease>n, and after spending a year in Switzerland, he has returned and appears to be in fine form.

Junior Brian Gidlow, an out- fielder last year, will be start- ing catcher. Gidlow was the fourth leading hitter in 1967, batting .278. Either junior Jim Wilson or Albany Pharmacy sophomore Mike lVlagee will fill the first base spot. Wilson was the starting catcher last season, but he batted only .108. Veterans Dave Hourigan and Tom Miller return to play short- stop and third respectively. Hourigan is a fine fielder, but both have to prove themselves at the plate. Hourigan batted over .300 as a sophomore, but fell more than 100 points last year. --------- ~,:···· '}'·· , •• w· ....... , .... ~I Car Buffs do itt~ :Inglish !eatlter®: .

In contrast to last season's poor s p r in g w e a t ih e r that plagued the Garnet nine before the start of the season, and eventually cut the schedule to ten games, Coach Lawrence's squad will have two weeks' out- door practice before Saturday's opener with ~obart. Tax Provides Funds An agreement has been reach- ed on the funding of club sports for the 1968-69 season. Theplan, which was hammered out in a meeting attended by President Martin, Dean Olton, Dean Lucas, Mr. Ketz, and the members of the student tax committee,. calls for the creation of a special! dub sports fund, which wm be funded on a 50-50 basis by the student tax and the administra- tion. Under the plan, the chairman of the tax committee and the President will decide at tlle be- ginning of each year upon a to- tal amount of money to be allo- cated for club sports. It .Js un- derstood that the decision will be made after a preliruinary study of the needs of the clubs and the resources of the tax committee. Pr~sident Martin envisions a fund larger than the $500 given this year, for the year 1968-69. Once a total amount of money has been decided upon, tlte al- location of the funds among the various sports will be taken over by a club sports committee com- prised of faculty mernbevs in- terested in athletics, and' stu- dent representatives of the club sports. The budgets of the clubs will be administered by the Ath- letic Department, which will ex- ert no control over the clubs other than making sure that their funds are spent sensibly. * * * * * * In other club sport news, the ski club competed in two meets in their abbrievated season~ fin- ishing twelfth out of fourteen at Cortland and sixth out of eleven teams at Paul Smith's. The club .· TIMS rena CH!NCE .. sent five men to each meet, and competed in the alpine events only. At Cortland, Bob Hayes' 21st place in the giant salom was the best effort, while at Paul Smith's Hayes was elev- enth in the salom and Guy Gra- ham was 21st in the giant salom. The sailing club opens a five- meet schedule this Saturday and Sunday when it competes in the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association Freshman Championships at Cornell. Up- perclassmen begin competition at the West Point regatta on April 20-21 and continue May 4-5 at Tufts, where Union will represent the MAISA in an in· tersectional championship.

Beta, who was the intramural league champs here at Union, also emerged as champs at the in· tercollegiate tournament. In the opening round last W ednesd~y, Beta defeated Pi Kappa Alpha of R.PJ. 54-46. Delta Phi squeezed by an All- Star tea from Siena 53-52, Overcome Chi Phi The next night, in the semi-finals, Beta overcame Chi Phi of R.P .I. 53;50. Del- ta Phi, 1 ea. ding most of the way, was tied at the buzzer when the Potter Club All- Stars of Albany State threw a thirt)'-foot desperation bomb; tlie Albany State All- Stars finaHy pulled the game out in the overtime 61-60. Delta Phi has been dogged by ill fortune all season, los- ing the intramural champion- ship here to Beta on a last second b~sket, and losing to Beta again in the Schenec- tady City League Champion- ships in <Jvertime. In the Friday night finals, Beta took the championship 52-43 over the Albany State All-Stars. Eeta led most of the way, as Albany State did not play their best game and were unable to keep the score cbse. Middlebury Invasion Marks Lacrosse Debut By LEN Sll\'ION Tomorrow aliternoon at 2:30 the lacrosse team hosts Middlebury to open a season which. cou1ld range anywhere from the pinnacle of success to. dismal disillusionment. Lacrosse has blossomed only in the past two years for Union College. Two seasons ago Bruce Allison led his team to a sparkling 10-1 record, in his first big coaching success 111ere. Last season the team was s,z, with mostly underclassmen playing the key roles. This season. was looked to as one which could he the best to date, with a more challenging schedule. The big question mark was in inexperienced defense. The qaestion mark remains! On attack, veteran seniors Lee Schneider and Steve Ritter bush team with newcomer Bruce Westby to, give the Garnet a scoring potential greater than nearly every opponent we play. Senior Ken Milne and' soph Doug Duval lead the midfielders and excel! at every aspect of the game. The rest of the middies mak.e up in hustle what they may lack in experience and 'ball-handhng, and the four line· depth of this year's team is a first for the Garnet. The goal is manned by senior Ken Auerbach, who started ·last season and turned in many fine games. However, Larry Gillette is the only experienced defenseman on the squad. This lack of game experience has. shown up. i,n scrimmages with Siena and the Alumm. The defensive potential ,Is there but if it comes around too late, the season may be a dis- appointment. lf it clicks from the outset, anything up to a perfect record is quite possible. Middlebury will enter the contest tomorrow with a 1-4 record, the result of a southern trip during which they faced fin~ com- petition. They were defeated by Towson, Loyola, Adelphi, and Fairleigh Dickinson at Madison, while their lone victo!Y came o:ver N.Y. Maritime. The record is not so bad if one re!ll!zes the com- petition, and the game experience will work to their advantage. The 11-2 victory over the ;\lun:;mi ~aturday was a_ sli~ht improvement over Wednesday's blt w1th S1ena. Ball-handhng liD- proved and Auerbach performed better in the nets. Soph Ron Wall is still hobbled and may not play tomorrow. In contention for starting defense posts along with Gillette are Wall, Kevin Monahan, Steve Herrick, and Sandy Swope. Also Pete Brittin and Jim O'Neil may switch middle lines for tomorrow's game. SENIORS!

's ten or ,,·\Emphasizes Student Responsibility By ALLEN GARTNER The All College Council last night unanim<:>usly passed a motion, effect- , \ ive next Fall making Convocations ''open\ and thereby \encouraging the student to attend Convocations with- out being forced to do so\ ;) \1 '' II The motion was only a small part of an extended effort by the Student Council and the ACC to improve the quality of Convocations at Union. Further action last night by the ACC including changing the Convoca- tion Hour from 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. o and establishing a sub-committee of five students (two from each Center and one from Student Council) to select Convocation speakers and pub· ,, !f l~cize their appearance \well-ahead of bme.\ II The number of Convocations are also likely to be reduced so that the quality of speakers will be improved and more money can be used to pro- vide speakers for individua~ centers and departments. President Martin emphasized, however, that all of this action is, of course, subject to approv- al by the faculty. Students were ade- quately represented, as member ·of the IFC, and Student Councicl were present. The li:kelihood of passing these im- portant motions seemed dim at the outset of last night's meeting. It was only after much discussion and, at times, heated debate, that progress was made. The motion to eliminate the Convocation requirement did not come unti:l 15 minutes before the close of the meeting. According to Grady Aronstamm, president of Student Council and The ACC, \the action taken by the All College Council is by far the most significant and far-reaching thing this organization has done all year.\ Black Students Form Allian~e; 'I) Blame Whites ForKing's Death Organized To Aid Area Slums The Black Students of Union College announced this week that they have organized and founded the Tri-City Area Black Students Alliance. The alliance then issued a statement calling the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis a week ago, \an answer for their (Black people's) struggle for free- dom and dignity in this sick racist society.\ The statement went on to condemn \facist police forces\ who kill and humiliate Blacks, and that it is these elements along with racist American so- ciety which is responsible for the breakdown in law and order, such as the riots ,, \ which followed King's murder. cated to \work side by side with our Such a society as ours, the state- Black Brothers in the ghettoes of the ment says, \cannot blame its sickness Tri-City Area to achieve the freedom and racism on individuals\ but on the and dignity which the white citizens 11 country itself \which is built on vio- of the nation always have taken for lence and injustice\ towards Black granted.\ The alliance said it plans people. \We think Dr. King was rnur- to work in Schenectady with or dered when this society was born.\ through any group dedicated to this The Black students \vow to avenge his (King's) murder and the mur<;Ier of all other black peopl_e by w~g1!lg a relentless struggle untll we ebmm- ate all forces of racism and oppres- sion the world over.\ Black Students Alliance is dedi- goal. The Black Students further said they \hope that all whites of good will here at Union and in the Sche- nectady area will recognize our sig- nificance and dedicate themselves to similar goals.\ Private State Colleges President Harold C. Martin yesterday joined the presidents of five other area private colleges in recommending that New York e x t e n d direct financial aid to private co:Heges in the state. Martin and the presidents of Skidmore, Vassar, Siena, RPI and Hamilton testified before the State Senate Committee on Edu- cation in favor of the Bundy report which recommends state aid to private college. In explaining his position, Mar- tin said \the state can better af- ford to help existing private in- stitutions of quality than face the risk that they will go bankrupt or decline in quality.\ He said, \clear evidence\' that many priv- ate colleges are having financial difficulties further supports this plan. Further, Martin said, state aid to private institutions \brings a greater return than aid to public Students Will Voice Presidential Choice By TONY BERK Union College students will have the opportunity to participate in a nationwide presidential primary and to vote on national issues on April 24. The program called Choice '68 will be sponsored by Time magazine and has already attracted nearly 1,000 col· leges from across the country. The ballot requests the student's first three choices for President in- cluding write-ins. In addition, three questions concerning national issues will be included. They concern the course of military action the U.S. should pursue in Vietnam, the ques- tion of bombing North Vietnam, sub- ject to change with events between now and April 24, and a choice of priorities in government spending to alleviate the \urban crisis\ in the u.s. After the voting is over, nation- wide results will be sent to Choice 68 headquarters in New York to be eval· uated and publicized. Why Bother? Political Science professor John Saloma of MIT called Choice 68 \as important as the primary in any contested state... In a country in which nearly half the electorate will soon be under 30 years old, any con- certed political effort of students on a national scale cannot be overlooked, he said. A serious and well-coordi· nated campaign, with the participa- tion of severitl million students, could have great significance, because more votes might be cast in it than in any of the small-state primaries. From time to time, there has been evidence of dissatisfaction, among members of the student body 1 with the lack of any political activism at Union. Choice 68 is a good opportun- ity for students to take part in the political events of an extremely im- portant election campaign. More to Come In the next two weeks before the primary, more about Choice '68 will be presented in Concordiensis. Any- one interested in working on the pre- parations for the primary, please con- tact Teddy Steingut, at Phi Sigma Delta. institutions because the private institution is already putting its own money into the education of its students.\ Also under consideration by the committee is a program of increasing scholarships above the present level calculated to the needs of the student. Under this plan, any student with the aca- demic qualifications would be fi- nancially enabled to attend the college of his 61oice. \The better plan for private colleges is the Bundy plan,\ Martin said. State Commissioner of Educa- tion James E. Allen also en- dorsed the Bundy plan as a short run objective. Under this ·plan, a total of 134 private colleges in New York State might receive state money.\ On the question of the effect of direct state aid on the auto-n- omy of private colleges, Martin said such aid would require the college to make regular reports of its financial condition to the state, but he sees \no more risk of loss of autonomy in this pro- gram than exists through pres- ent federal aid programs. NOTICE Union College did not cancell classes in honor of the late Martin Luther King, according to Presi- dent Martin, because the College felt the continuation of classes would be in the tradition of the civil rights leader. Commissioner of Education Dr. James E. Allen had urged universities not to close classes. President Martin also thought a cancellation would be a mockery of Dr. King's memory in view of the ball-playing and other activities during the King memorial and march. UIC Resolves •' (! Stickmen Slash Panthers~ 7-4 The College decided not to can· cell classes Friday after consulta- tion with Albany State and RPI, although Albany subsequently can- celled classes. It' l{ \l ',' l~ To Extend Hours For Coed Guests The Union Interresidence Council passed a resolution Tuesday night calling for the extension of parietal hours on weekdays to 10:00 P:M. The council has put forth the be~Ief that the extension of two hours will allow a more natural situation for coed studying or socializing, without un- duly hindering the rights of others in the dorm. Lengthy Discussion The motion, after lengthy diSClfS· sion was carried by a 16-4 margm, with two abstentions. Co-sponsors of the motion, Howard Blank and Lep Simon, hope that the ~tudent C~mn~Il and the Intra-Fratermty Council Will consider the motion at their next meetings, so that more than one mo· tion may be submitted to the All College Council. Natural Extension The Council hopes for a situation ~ similar to last year, when three sim- ilar but not identical proposals were forwarded to the All College Council by the three aforementioned bodies. Blank and Simon, in urging the pas· sage of the motion, saw· it as a nat· ural extension of the reforms of last spring, without being a real liberali· zation in relation to a purely dating OJ '~ situation. :By LEN SIMON The lacrosse team opened its season yesterday with an encouraging per- formance in a 7-4 victory over Middlebury. S at u r d a y the Gar- net hopes to show further im- provement as it hosts Stevens Tech at 2:30 on Daley Field. The Garnet put together three fine quarters and one very poor stanza in subduing the Panthers, who now stand at 1-5. Lee Schneider led the attack with two goals and three as- sists, while Sam Dill also tallied twice. Tad Knight had a goal and an assist, Steve Ritterbush and Bob Seefried one goal apiece, and Jim O'Neil one assist. Ritterbush's unassisted tally was the only score in a first period which saw Union dominate the play entirely, getting off over twenty shots. The ball seldom found its way across midfield and the only thing that saved Middlebury from being routed was an outstanding performance by its goalie. Panthers Rally In the second period, however, the inexperienced Garnet defense was fin- ally tested 1 and beaten three times in successiOn. The Panther attack, once it got moving, easily moved into close range and put the ball past goalie Ken Auerbach. His defense was mostly at fault on the first two scores, but the third came when Auerbach fumbled the ball after a save and allowed the visitors another point blank shot. At this point Andy Bittker replaced Auerbach, and with a lot more help from his defense, managed to keep the Panthers from scoring until the waning moments of the game. Knight hit Dill with a perfect pass for the only Garnet goal of the period. The second half was a different story as the defense made amends by playing heads up ball. Larry Gillette was, as usual, the leading light on the defense, while Kevin Monahan showed tremendous hustle and hitting ability, while making a few early errors. All four midfield lines per- formed well, and the sophomores showed marked improvement over earlier efforts. Bruce Westby saw no action due to a shoulder injury, and may be lost indefinitely to the team. De- fenseman Ron Wall is recovering from an ankle sprain, and may see some action Saturday, although it is un- likely he will start. Lee Schneider leads Garnet attack in Yesterday's Lacrosse win over Middlebury HCM Proposes CO Readmission President Martin, as a faculty meet- ing on March 12, said that he would propose to the Board of Trustees a policy whereby students who for rea- sons of conscience refuse to serve in the Armed Forces would be re-ad- mitted to Union without prel~dice. The concensus of opinion at the meeting, held in room 110 of the Social Science Building, was general approval of the statement, especially as regards students who serve as con- scientious objectors under the Selec- tive Service Act. No Objections There were no substantial ()bjec- tions either, to the readmission of students who break the law because of conscience, by such acts as fleeing the country or refusing to report for duty. It was felt that it is not the function of the college to punish stu- dents for Federal offenses. Once an individual has paid the penalty of imprisonment for violating any law, he has, on being freed, the human rights to live and work.

2 Thursday, April 11, 1968 Student Members of ACC Explain ~ew Convo System Commitments Letters to the Editor As Usual To the Editor: By JIM RUBENSTEIN, DICI\.

The. stores, and the Colonie Center Council's unanimity showed that it expects the student were closed in deference and respect for all <>r part of the body to respond to lecturers, m1:1.sicians, and artists, day, while at Union College it through individual initiative. In no way is this action meant was \business as usuaL\ to be an emancipation. Rather, it is a challenge for this student body to show its involvement in the cultural - intell:ectual mileau without threats and without coercion. By changing convocation hour to the evening, and by seeking quality rather than quantity in its program, the newly formed Convocation Committee will attempt to alter the concept of convocation as it stood in the past. Now, students should not feel compelled to sit through an addi- tional lecture in the midst of a crowded academic day. Now, more than evere before, Convocation will become a high- light in the student's academic life. It is expected that the five student subcommittee, which will help to choose speak- ers, will be able to provide an integrated and vital segment for life in the college community. Any increased opportunity for the student to control his academic or intellectual climate places responsibility for expansion entirely upon the individual. There will con- tinue to be ample opportunity for the student to attend worthwhile lectures and concerts. There will continue to be ample opportunities to follow up initial exposure through smaller meetings and conferences. All Union men are faced with a new situation: they have greater influence in the arrangement and choice of speakers. They will be able by voluntarily attending lectures and concerts and responding to speakers and per- formers to initiate the long-awaited revival of a genuine in- tellectual interest on this campus. The All College Council's action has great ramifica- tions. It will encourage Union students to seek actively an expansion of their educational experience. It should be an important first step towards the evolution of a well- balanced, well-rounded, enthusiastic student body. We believe that the spirit of the All College Council's action will find unanimous concurrence from the Faculty Council as well as the student body.

Charge To the Editor: Last Sunday, Memorial Chap- el was the scene of a memerial service for Dr. Martin Luther King, sponsored by the Area Council of Churches and at- tended by s~me two thousand persons from the community, in- cluding the Mayor, Congress- man Button, the members of the City Council and the County Board of Representatives, many area religious leaders, as well as numerous members of the Col- lege faculty and staff. At the conclusion of the service, those attending marched in silent pro- cession from the chapel to the steps of City Hall. It is regret- table that only a handful of Un- ion students showed their con- cern with the major issue con- fronting our society by partici- pating, or found it possible to desist from the usual Sunday fun and games in recognition of the solemnity of the occasion. It is even more regrettable that the brothers of Alpha Delta Phi, whose house was along the line of march, greeted the proces- ~ion with laughter, and thought 1t appropriate to create a picnic atmosphere by offering lemon- ade to the marchers. . Over the past two years, Un- Jon College students have cam- paigned for the elimination of parietal rules and for student participation in various aspects of policy making at the College claiming that they were respon: sible young adults who should be treated as such. We, who have been sympathetic to their cause, must unhappily conclude that the performance of at least some students last Sunday casts the most serious doubts on the validity of that claim. JAMES D. PALMER MANFRED JONAS NORMAN A. MERCER. Defense To the Edit()J': Rumors have been circulat- ing concerning the actions of two Union men during the march honoring Dr. Martin Lu- ther King on April 7. 424 State Street Schenectady Printing Co.; Inc. 502 Broadway 377-8838 In behalf of my fraternity, I should like to clarify the mat- ter. As the marchers proceeded past the Alpha Delta Phi house, two brothers (with my approv- al) approached the marchers with pitchers of lemonade and paper cups and offered the re- freshments to the marchers. Several marchers with sman children asked for, and were given, cups of lemonade. The parents expressed their appreci- ation. Finally one lady voiced disapproval, and the students, fearin.g others might be offend- ed, immediately returned to the fraternity house. The men acce!'lted no money for the lemonade. Their inten- tions were good ones, and we are sorry if their actions were misunderstood. GEORGE H. D. SCHULZ. P1·esident, Alpha Delta Phi Sick Cents To the Editor: not cost 6c each letter.

By P A 1JL FA.RNHAM The newly appointed committee will be in- volved with the legal and, more important, the educational aspects of the problem. The com- mittee will discuss how Olton would deal with the law if he should be contacted by officials planning a raid. Olton stressed that the college is not inte:rested in using undercover tactics.

Less than ten show up in the Freshman Records of the .past two classes and only a half dozen were in the group that was accepted for '\ the Class of 1972. It is unlikely that as many as half of them wHl be enrolled. other schools of Union's ilk are able to attract significant numbers of Black students. Haver- • ford, Hamilton, and Wesleyan are just three that have been ·particularly successful. Yet Union should not compete for disadvantaged students solely because others do. One simply cannot be ·' . G' ay.rare of the _trend .of recent American cultural history and shll exclude Black pe0.ple from one's considerations. Simi-larly, it is irresponsible and morally negli- ,, · • gent to go about recruiting a freshman class for Union College without trying to include a mean- ingful number of Black students. •ll Strive for Excellence Composing a class that begins to meet some ef the needs of the disadvantaged community in our ,. nation leads to a confrontation of some of the varied goals of the Col'lege. For example, twenty three percent of the Class of 1970 scored below 550 in the verbal SAT. If Union is to drive towards excellence, it has to upgrade the caliber '' of the people admitted. Admitting increased numbers of disadvantaged students is not going to improve the SAT profile. ,, .. 4 • According to College Board Review, only ten to 15 percent of Negro twelfth graders can achieve at the 400 level in the verbal SAT, and only one or two percent score at the 500 level. ,, . t: Therefore, an increased number of disadvan- taged students would compromise the College's drive to raise its standards. \ Special Programs Furthermore, since disadvantaged students rarely have the traditional skills that are neces- (, sary to survive academically here, we would be obliged to initiate all sorts of new programs - remedial instruction, lightened course loads or courses that do not read and examine in 'the usual manner. { Freshmen coming to Union from out of the ghettos also need financial aid in large quan- tities. The College, however, does not have the <. resources at hand to provide that needed assis- tance. In 1950, when tuition was $500 and there were 280 freshmen, the budget for aid to frosh Not In Sr~p For the Class of 1972, 420 men will divide $130,000 towards a tuition char,ge of $2Hl0. That comes to less than $3W per man and meets less than r5 percent of that class' tuition charges. Since Union has not heen able to maintain its regular .scholarship funrls in line with the increase in the size of thE student body, the resour.ees to attract disadvantaged students would be similarly difficult to raise. Supposing for a moment that Union had the financi-al resources to recruit Black students, it seems unlikely that many would find Union at- tractive. The social situation for them with re- gards to women is not at aU promising, since our sister schools are as remiss as ourselves in their contributions to the Black community. Egalitarian'? :/ilvh 1 The fraternity system migl!t present a similarly depressing view. Young people who are im- pressed with the thinking of James Baldwin or Stokely Carmichael, might be less than intrigued by exclusive secret societiEs. ,Ailso, the record of the mass of Union stuclents with regard to manifestations of social consciousness and egali- tarianism is not above repr<>ach. As things are now, Union is a de facto segre- gated school, and the presence of a few Ameri- can and Mrican Negroes oJJly serves to demon- strate this most strikingly. :N()t unlike the public school systems of our country, we are obliged to attempt to aright this iJUbaiance. And just as bussing programs and special schools have met with difficulties, so can we expect whatever is attempted at Union to be .similarly complicated and inconvenient. Tory J reach err Hypocrisy wil have reachEd new heights if the Administration of Union College continues to talk around initiating a program that will in- corporate disadvantaged B1ack Americans into the College population. Altl:tough no one can estimate the outcome of the Black Revolution with any authority, there can be little doubt indeed that it is taking place. Having been founded in 1795, Union was too late to take a stand in the American Revolution. She cannot afford to be a 'I'ory in the Black Revolution.

The members of this committee include three other faculty me1nbers and four students: Chris- topher Fried, AssoGi<ite Professor ·of Psychology, Kevork Nahabedian, Assistant Professor of -Chem- istry, John P. Ter.ry, le·ctmer in Political Science, R. Balagur, M. Fribush, M. Levin-Epstein, and E. Robinson. p,resident Harold l\!lartin appointed the faculty members and· chose the students from a list presented by Olton. Martin, Olton, and Fried have previously held talks about what the drug experience meaiJs to students and what other ways there are for .satisfying it. Reasons of 11ealth and Law Although no one has been in contact with any members of the adlrtinistration about a drug raid at Union, Dean ()]ton realizes that a problem involving a limited number of students does exist. He does not thjnk that this is a seri()US or a campus-wide l>l!obtem. However, according to President Ma1tin, \ihe college for reasons of health and Jaw wiH take severe disciplinary action against students who are proved to be using, distr-ibuting, or selling illegal drugs. If called upon to do -S<>,. the college must, by law, co-operate with enfor-c~ment .officials.\ No student has been apprehended on these charges yet. Curricular Psychadelics With regard to a general educational policy, Olton has written to three dozen college deans of students requesting information on the drug problem. He believes that the committee may decide to publish its own pamphlet on the psy- chiatric, legal, medical, and social dimensions of the issue. Other possible lines of action include: establishing a section in the library with mater- ials on drugs; discussing the problem in fresh- man orientation; establishing a type of course, either regular or extracurricular on the larger subject of mind expansion. The committee may make recommendations to the Dean of Students and the Discipline Committee involving their amount of detective work and flexibility. The committee win probably spend at least the first half of the term educating itself on the subject matter. An attempt was made in choosing members to get people with various attitudes toward drugs. Olton expects much debating within the committee to take place. He hopes that a possitive suggestion will be made from this debate sometime within the spring term.

McCabe, 1'4cAvoy and junior Norm Lasda Will con- test the broad jump, with Fitz Turner and McCabe in the high jump. Lasda and McCabe will be in the triple jump. With the opening of tennis season two weeks away, Coach Benson is indefinite about his starting lineup but is optimistic about the pros- · pects for the upcoming sea- SOil. The team sh0uld have considerable depth, a prob- lem which plagued last sea- son's 4-6 Garnet netmen. Ready For Stevens Sat. This spring may become one of contrasts for the 1968 Garnet track team. Although individ- ual performances ,look to be out- standing in some events, a lack of suffident depth and manpow- er may spel'l defeat for the squad. The frosh, however, lool{ to be a strong, well-b~lanced squad with much promise for the future. . Garnet varsity strength Is centered in the shorter tr~ck events. Pete Ericson, commg off a fine indoor season, ~nd Dave Gray look to be consist- ently at the top in both the 100 and 220 yard dashes. They may be joined at the 220 by one of the Garnet's aU-time top speed- sters senior Al Sessoms. Ses· soms' has a good shot at break· ing the Union 220 record, al- though he will probably concen· trate on the 440, the distance he ran last season. He wi'll be join- ed in the quarter-mile by Carl Thumm, who will also race the 880 for the Garnet. Pleasant Surprises George Gardner, Tom Oberst, and Larry Relyea will put the shot, with McAvoy slated to compete i:n the pole vault. Oberst and Ed Blechner are scheduled for the discus, with Turner and Oberst in the jave- lin. Frosh Flashes The frosh will have a strong, deep squad, although a few of their number have been lost to academics. Coleman looks for outstanding performances from his dashers, Joe Kirkup, Art Riccio, Harold Heckman, and Mario Fischetti. Mark Boylen and Steve Kaufman highlight the 440 squad. Distance men John McMannus, Joe Burgess, and Rich Cooperwasser should do well. Bill Bush looks strong in the broad and high jumps. He will be joined in the latter by Bob Berger, another fine prospect. Although: the w~ights will suffer from mexpertence, Scotct Wagar and Bill Dawson should do well in the pole vault. Retl:trning from last year's . squad are senior Brad Wheat- ley, this year's captain, an.d Juniors Len Duckworth, Jeff Kurzius, Steve Karp, and Martin Berry. The undefeat- ed freshman team of last sea- son will provide added depth with sophomores Jeff South, Pete Siegel, and Jim Nels~n being counted upon to aid the varsity. Many capable tenn-is play- ers are competing for berths on the frosh squad but it is also too early to determine positions. John Lauroesch and Jack Liu have been im- pressive in pre-season prac- tice. The varsity opens its sea- son on April 2() with an away match with the University of Rochester while the fresh- men begin with an away con- test with Northwood Acad- emy on April 27. By JAY BLITZMAN The freshman lacrosse squad de:£eated Cobleskill University and Darrow Academy in scrim- mages this week in preparation for the opening of their season Saturday against Stevens. Cob- leskill was trounced 15-4 while Darrow fell 7-5. Coach Gary Brown has a club -with undeniable offensive pow- €r. The attacks starting this season are Wayne Christie, J(enny Lorenze and Ned Duke- hart. Complementing this trio is George Hobbes, whose abili- ties are far from lacking, In the Cobleski:ll scrimmage, the Garnet attack featured six goals by Dukehart, three goals and four assists by Christie, and two goals apiece for Hobbes and J,orenze. The baby Garnet po- sess experience in the midfield positions, as they do on attack. The first line consists -of Bruce Dugan, Ed Green and Dan Hoov- er, each being highly skillful at stick handling and shooting. Garnet problems are concen- trated in the distance events. At present, Coleman has no run- ner for the two mile, and a~ the mile he must depend on wex- perienced Art Jacobs. Both hur- dle events look to be p~oblems, although pleasant surpnses may be in store here. Art McC~be will be called on to run the high hurdles, with Ron McAvoy a~d Charles Sabatelle scheduled m the 440~s. Indoor experience should Truckers Sweep To Gain First Place Tie In DCL Key operatives on this squad include Christie, perhaps the team's number one player, Duke- hart and Dan Gould on defense. Wayne is relatively short and compact, while possessing con- siderable strength, and adds to these attributes fine speed, and 'AROUND TOWN·: serve the Garnet well in the Rugby Opens At Skidmore The rugby club, in its third vear of operation, opens its sea- son next Wednesday, with a match against Williams Coll~ge at Skidmore. The club, whtch will be operating with about 25 members also has three home matches ~n its spring schedule, meeting Albany Medical on April 27, Albany Law on May 4, and Amherst on May 18. The club played a pair of con- tests last fall, winning one and losing one, but has been denied any funds from Student Tax of the Administration. As a result, the club has been unable to purchase the equipment it de- sired. With three weeks remaining, a big battle is shaping up for the team title in the Dutch Classic Bowling League. In last week's action, the Truckers moved into a first place tie by sweeping four points from Team # 5. Teddy K's Tavern, which had come from sixth place to a two-point first place lead, lost 31~ points to Cavalier's Rest- aurant, to move into the tie. Jim McBride led the Truck- er's sweep, with a 561 total, while Teddy K's was led by Gary Prevost's 548.

Wilsons Coming; Pickett And Flip By LEN KAGAN and D. PETER DROTMAN A group of 45 independents and several fraternity men concluded a short meeting last night with plans to organize a \constructive alterna- tive to the Union College fraternity system,\ Paul Vivian a freshman in- dependent said. Vivian, who called the meeting in the library's music room, said the purpose of the organization would be two-fold: to improve the social life of the independents and to broaden the intellectual and cultural life of the campus as a whole. Fraternity Failures He stressed that, \fraternities have failed in these areas.\ Citing Dean Olton's proposals outlined in the April 11 Concordiensis as valuable, Vivian did not elaborate on whether the in- dependents or the fraternity men would be more effective in this field. Lack of Life The \distinct lack of social life\ for non-fraternity men was also dis- cussed. S e v e r a I independents, including UIC president Lance SpaH- holz, noted that Inter-Residence Coun- cil parties open to all Union men would probably be planned fGr major weekends especially, with the in- creased possibility that some fratern- ities may close their parties. How- ever, SpaHholz emphasized that the UIC is not an independent organiza- tion since many brothers and pledges live in dormitories from which the urc draws its representation. Open Organization Although Vivian stressed that the organization would be open to fra- ternity men, there did appear to be strong anti-fraternity sentiment from others present. Suggestions from the floor included forced closing of houses with discriminatory clauses, and in- dependent rushing of freshmen. In addition, Vivian suggested that the group work to delay fraternity rush- ing until the sophomore year. Two Committees In further business, two committees were appointed: one to organize social activities for the coming weekends, and another to \articulate the plat- form and goals\ of the organization. Additionally, it was announced that several faculty members would be asked to attend the next meeting. Sanford Expounds New College Role By RICHARD BALAGUR Dr Nevitt Sanford, Professor of Psychology and Education at Stan- ford University, last Thursday de- clared that the role of colleges is ~ot the production of marketable s~nll.s but rather the development of m~I­ vidual personalities in a Memonal Chapel Convocation. Dr. Sanford said, \Colleges should not educate minorities in 01;der to use them to increase production but because we want to help them de- velop themselves.\ quainted with his own feeling\ and thereby better able to relate to others. Educational reform, he declared, will come about through an alliance between students and administration, since \they are the only people to look at the institution as a whole and are interested in its improvement as a whole.\ \It is the faculty that particularly resists change.\ The faculty is more interested in professional advance- ment and the status of their particu- lar department, he .said. At Berkley faculty neglect of undergraduate edu- cation led to revolt. Flip Wilson will appear in the Field- house April 27. By LLOYD WOLKENFELD Soul Singer Wilson Pickett and Comedian.

Colored Seats Seats in the Field House will be arranged in sections for stu- dents and Schenectadians_ Dif- ferent colored tickets will be iss- ued and separate entrances will Dean Asks Houses To Prove There Is No Discri~nination Union's 16 national fraternities were asked last week to prove to the Office of the Dean of Students that they are non-discriminatory in accordance with the 1964 and 1968 Federal Civil Rights Acts. Acting Dean of Students Charles Olton said the information must be obtained to make federal aid to the college possible. He said the college has been told verbally that fratern- ities do not discriminate but that written proof is now necessary. \We must have evidence to prove what we're sure is a reality,\ the Dean added. \Other schools took care of this business years ago.\ In a letter addressed to fraternity presidents, the Dean said the request was not an anti-fraternity measure, but it is necessary to keep the houses clean. Dean Olton added that the request is part of an effort by the Admin- istration to collect written data about Union's fraternities so it is better prepared to deal with them in the future. He said this information will protect both the college and fratern- ities from unintentional violati_ons of civil rights laws. The dean briefly outlined the poss- ibilities open in the event that any fraternities have discriminatory mem- bership clauses: He said they could either become locals or obtain local autonomy from the national head- quarters. The dean added that he is surprised that ther-e are no locals at Union. If it turns out that any fraternities discriminate against Negroes or Jews, Dean Olton added, \they must mend that fence - or else.\ Presently four of Union's fratern- ities have at least one Negro mem- ber and all have one Jewish brother or more . We must dispell, he said, \the no- tion that the poor mus~ somehow d~­ serve to gain the benefits of o~r soci- eties.\ The middle-class youth 1s fre~ to develop himself but n9t t~o~e of mi· norities Members of mmor1t1es must be taught to appreciate reading, to enjoy music and dramatic art - be· cause they are human beings - .not because it will help them get a JOb. Pearce Helps 6-4 Triumph Sanford urged colleges to ta~e steps to admit four per cent of their students from those who have college boards below average but have a po- tential recognized by counselors, and although this w~uld only be. a drop in the bucket It would tnple the number of minorities in college. \We should look at the educational needs of disadvantaged people with· out reference to college as it now exists. What we must do is address ourselves to people and what can ~e done. Institutions geared to therr needs, something like college but not necessarily the same will evolve.\ Colleges and universities of the fu- ture will be greatly changed, Sanford predicted. They will exist \as retreats from the world, a mix of adults and college-age people, which will per· haps finally reduce the generation gap.\ Adults will go on with college, or some other educational experience, because everyone will continue to develop himself to the ends of his days. Much of \college\ will be field work in the cities. Our goal, he said, should be to enable each student to become aware of himself so that he doesn't project his own shortcomings onto others. We must open ourselves \so each stu- dent, black or white, is better ac- By GARY PREVOST Ken Pearce rapped three hits and drove home two runs while scoring two himself Saturday as the Garnet nine opened their 1968 season with a 6-4 victory over Hobart. Bob Hallen- back pitched the route, giving up just seven hits and one earned run. The Dutchmen built up a 5-1 lead in the seventh inning, and appeared to be coasting home when Hobart came up with three runs with the help of two errors. Both teams tallied a run in the first inning, with the Garnet score coming on doubles by Mike Solomon and Pearce. The Lawrencemen gained the lead for good in the fourth inning, when Pearce singled, stole second and scored on Ken Merchant's triple to deep left. Mike McGee brought Mer· chant home with a single moments later. Scoring twice more in the sixth inning the Garnet built up the 5-1 lead, as safeties by McGee and Jim Wilson drove in runs. The final tally came in the seventh when Solomon walked, stole second and scored on Pearce's second double of the after- noon. Hobart's beginning was triggered by two errors, a walk, and a two-run double. The Garnet face King's Point to- morrow at 3:00 on Alexander Field. Bill Neidel is the probable starter. The Garnet's questionable hitting was outstanding Saturday, but Hobart star- ter Schmitt cannot be classed as one of the fastest or best hurlers the Dutchmen will face this year. Unio~;s Baseball Team on way to 6-4 win over Hobart be established. This is a result of events at the Beach Boys con· cert last year, in which f.ront seats were dominated by early- arriving towns people. Social Chairman Rusty Man- ker secured the performers through the College Entertain- ment Agency, which served Union for Fall and Winter Week- ends. On the Saturday afternoon previous to the concert Union will face Colgate in lacrosse at 2:30 on Daley Field. \Mustang Sally\ Wilson Picket emerged in show business in 1959 with a group called the Falcons with a song called \I Have a Love\. Later he separated from them and his original hits include: \If You Need Me,\ \Soul Dance :If= 3 \ ''Funky Broadway\ \Mustang Sally\ \634:-5789\, and \Every- body Needs Somebody to Love.\ Bell Hop Flip VVilson has appeared on the Johnny Carson and Ed SUlli- van Shows several times, and is signed up by Sullivan for 6· per- formances in 1968. His career began in 1954, when, as a bell nop, he convinced the hotel man- ager to let him do· a brief walk on stage as a drunk. He has since appeared at the Bitter End, the Village Gate, and Downstairs at the Upstairs in New York, at the hungry i in San Francisco, and at Mr. Kelly's in Chicago. Ambassador To Speak The Rt. Hon. Lord Caradon, perm- anent representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, will speak at Union College at 4:30 p.m. Friday, April 19. Lord Caradon's appearance is under the joint sponsorship of the college's International Relations Club and Po- litical Forum and the Institute of Man and Science at Rensselaerville. He will spealt in the Social Sciences Building auditorium. Following his appearance at Union, Lord Caradon will go to Rensselaer- ville to participate in the Institute on Man and Science seminar on strength- ening the United Nations. He will be joined by 20 U.N. colleagues under the chairmanship of C. V. Narasimhan, the secretar-y-general's chef de cabinet. A long-time member of the Eritish foreign service, Lord Caradon will discuss current problems facing the United Nations, including the Near East and Far East situations. His distinguished career as a British over- seas administrator began in the Mid- dle East. Cheesy A veternarian is needed for part time work at Union College to help relieve the recent problem of bloat- ing. First on the casuality list was Junior Ed Blechner who attempted to down three pounds of cream cheese in 30 minutes last night in Phi Ep's commissary. Gobling forth, he sped on through two and a quarter pounds to miss the $20 prize offered by Pete Siegel. Bill Schwartzman, a sopho- more, will next week be hitched up for the next try. Is there a Vet in the house?

Per haps the recommendation of greatest long run sig- nificance to the quality of student extra-curricular life at Union is the one calling for tl:e creation of the office of Director of Student Affairs and Activities. Student activ- ities have mushroomed both in quantity and quality over the past two years. There is no reason to believe that as students begin to relate their classroom experience to life in general, and attempt to supplement the classroom experi- ence, the growth of student activities will not continue. The purpose of such an office, which should be a full time job held by a truly interested and capable person, would be, \to encourage creative activity and give direction to student life as a function complimentary to the aca- demic environment\ according to the July Committee. A central office, separate from the many diverse re- sponsibilities of the Dean of Students, would better be able to concentrate on encouraging, advising, directing and coordinating student activities. While regulation would remain in the Dean of Stu- dents Office, a Director of Student Affairs Office could concentrate efforts on changing \the focus of the fratern- ities so that they become more fully responsible to campus life.\ With the l)irector's support, fraternities could share responsibility for some college functions such as those recently proposed by the Dean of Students. Fraternities would also receive financial support for activities of this nature undertaken through the Director's office. A Director of Student Affairs, working with the var- ious activities could be a definite catalyst for improving the present (high) level of extra-curricular life at the College. We do not expect the creation of that office to diminish the autonomy of activities greatly, but to raise their hori- zons, and we strongly urge the creation of such a post. The report also went on to point out \the dining prob- lem at West College.\ The cafeteria is indeed \institutional cramped, cold, and surprisingly impersonal\. In view of the fact that there is no campus center where students and faculty (or the two groups separately) can interact, cafeterias become central places for this exchange. If they are as described above, very few professors are going to feel willing to eat there, and the students who do, will find the atmosphere conducive to eating and leaving as soon as possible. }!;specially since all freshmen are required to eat in West College, a greater effort should be forth coming to make the dining atmosphere one of warmth and informality. ln the academic arena, nothing has been done to implement the committee recommendation that the ROTC and Physical Education programs \be e:g:amined in the very near future.\ Bowdoin, Northeastern and Boston Univer- sity have all within the Jlast year abolished academic credit for military science courses given under ROTC pro- grams. Opponents of such credit have generally succeeded in convincing the institution involved that such\ courses either were not of a quality on par with other courses given at the institution or that such courses were basically in- compatible with the goals of a liberal arts college. The Physical Education program, no doubt one of the most comprehensive in existence, has, nevertheless a few disproportionate features. To require that a student com· plete three years of physical education at college is prac- tically unheard of elsewhere. Often, this requirement de- feats its own purpose by alienating the students from the rigor required to care for his health. It would be much more sensible, we feel, to try to make the physical education offerings so attractive that such stringent (resented) requirements will not be needed, such as was the approach of the recently revised Convoca- tion system. More emphasis should be placed on teaching carry over sports and encouraging intramural competition, which often requires more exercise than a week's mainte-· nance but receives no credit. Specifically, we urge the Faculty council to re-evaluate the ROTC program with regard to the ideas outlined above, and to abolish the three year compulsory phys. ed. require- ment ; replacing it with a more reasonable one year re- quirement, and appropriate re-emphases of phys. ed. re- sources. suitable for themselves to at- tend public ceremonies. As this relates specificaUy to student attendance, some did not pa}·- ticipate for this reason, some others did not even know about it, while others, after discover- ing what was happening that Sunday afternoon in the chapel felt that it would be direspect- ful to enter the service without tie and jacket. And although it was very sad to see a few students whose behavior was entirely incongruous with the seriousness of the occasion, I'm sure they were not acting in bad faith but simply did not realize how inappropriate their behavior was. I therefore feel that in mak- ing these charges you were be- ing very unfair and rather self- righteous. Demonstration of one's concern for his fellow man is found in positive and constructive action and not merely in intellectual assent and token gestures. Attend· ance at a memorial service is in itself an insignificent act.

Party's eyes, for prolonging the masses;' anticrilll.e legislation is With the coming ()[ the Spring Term, the \fraternity issue\ at Union appears finally to have reached that point where the Administration is clarifying its position through direct discussien with house rep- resentatives. This clarification should in- tensify with a forthcoming statement by President Martin, to appear shortly, Dean Olten's article last week did much te let fraterNity men know what direction the Administration would like to see the houses follow. Having spoken to fraternity and IFC leaders on campus, I feel it proper to say that some changes are alteady in the air- changes from within the fra- ternity system. For instance, this past weekend Delta Chi held an Easter party for Schenectady orphans at thek chapter house, lee .cream and soda were served, baskets distributed, and an egg hunt was h e l d. The biggest thrill of aU for many of the children was a ride in a con- vertible. This type of event, although not of an intellectual nature, is most important in the field of community service, another area toexcell. I know that at least where fraternities ar-e ·equiped one other house is planning a similar event, and tllere have been discussions to implement Dean Olton's \music-a!!t show\ sometime this spring, if there is sufficient t i m e to ·rnake the necessary arrangements.

WAS KEATS THE BOB DYLAN OF HIS DAY? Who was the greatest of the English Romantic Poets- Byron, Shelley or Keats? This question has given rise to many lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings. Let us today try to find an answer. First, Keats {or The LouisviHe Slugger, as heiR com- monly called.) Keats' talent bloomed early. While still a schoolboy at St. Swithin's he wrote his epic lines: - If I am good I ,qet an apple, So I don't whistle in the chapel. From this distinguished beginning he went on to write another 40 million poems, an achievement all the more re- markable when you consider that he was only five feet tall! I mention this fact only to show that physical prob- lems never keep the true artist from creating. Byren, for example, was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all winter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature never stopped writing poetry for one day. Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping Nell Gwynne's pigtails in an inkwell. (This later became known as Guy Fawkes Day.) He left England to fi.g-ht in the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and well, but women wet·e never far from his mind, as evi- denced by these immortal lines: How splendid it is to fight fo1' the Greek, But I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek. While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley stayed in Eng- land, where he became razor sharpener to the Duke of Gloucester. Shelley was happy in his work, as we know from his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no matter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge on the Duke's razor, and he was seon banished to Coventry. (This later became known as The Industrial Revolution.) One wonders how Shelley's life-and the course of Eng- lish poetry-would have differed if Personna Super Stain- less Steel Blades had been invented 2DO years earlier. For Personna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or whetting. It's sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays through shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade fit for a Duke or a freshman. Moreover, this Personna, this jewel of the blade-maker's art, this boon to the cheek and bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in double- edge style and Injector style. Get some now during \Be Kind to Your Kisser Week.\ But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Greece and Shelley in England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to grow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric: Althottgh I am only five feet high, Some day I will look in an elephant's eye. But Keats did not grow. His fdends, Shelley and Byron, touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This too failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oe:1kley. Shelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife Mary and wrote his famous poem: I love to stay home tvith the missus and write, And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite. 1725 Van Vranken Aven~e Featuring - HOME STYLE ITALIAN FOODS, STEAKS.

Keats tried to go too, but he was so small th.at the clerk at the steamship office couldn't see him over the top of the counter. So Keats remained in Rome and died of shortness.

Independent Fraternity? Page 1 Concordy Sports Baseball Pagel Lacrosse Dumps Stevens; Two Northern Foes Next By LEN SIMON Playing just well enough ~o win the lacvosse team ran the1r rec~rd to 2-0 with a 6-4 victory over Stevens Tech Saturday. The team is idle until this week- end, wheR they travel north to take on Clarkson and St. Law- rence. Allison's charges finally took the lead early in the third period as Bob Seefried scored: 'Jlhe visitors tied the game up again, but at this point Milne r e a 11 y went to w o r k. He scored to give the Garnet a 4-3 lead, and then won the ensuing face off, drew up the defense, and hit Ritterbush with a perfect pass for the score. Only seven seconds carne between the two scores. That ended the scoring for the third period with the host team holding a 5-3 edge. The final period saw the teams exchange goals once again, with Milne tallying un- assisted fGr the final Union score. Aside from the offen- sive heroics of Milne, the play of Larry Gillette was most im- pressive. Union will be the first oppon- ent for both Clarkson and St. :Lawrence, neither of which should pose a real problem. So- phomore defenseman Ron Wall should be oack in action, as he saw limited duty Saturday. The Engineers from l':few Jersey carried a 4-1 record mto Saturday's tilt, and proved a much more formidable foe than Middlebury. They exhibited great team speed, and kept the Garnet attack from breaking the game open, despite the fact that the visitors never really con- trolled the ball for any long period of time. First Goal The first goal of the ~arne was reminiscent of the Middle- bury encounter, as the Garnet defense failed to pick up a fast break and Stevens tallied from in cl~se. Coach Allison,_ how- ever, noted the team's biggest improvement was the defense, discounting the first quarter. Steve Ritterbush tied up the game late in the first period when he stole the ball from the goalie, and blasted it by him easily. Sophs Head Golfers; All Starters In 70~s The second period was more of the same, as Stevens took a 2-1 lead halfway through the period and Union quickly re- taliated on an unassisted goal by K:en Milne. The Stevens defense concentrated on stop- ping high scorers Ritterbush, and Lee Schneider, and the Gar- net had to mount an attack based on the midfielders, Milne in particular. The score stood at 2-2 at the half. INTRAMURALS Ey PETE HA. THAW A Y In last week's intramural swim meet, Psi Upsilon took the trophy easily, as expected, with a 44 point total. Delta Upsilon finished a distant sec- ond with 21 V2 points, followed by Kappa Alpha with 17 Yz and Delta Chi with 17. Psi Upsilon's strength was concentrated in the relays; they won both the medley and the freestyle relays by wide mar- gins_ Eill Porter again won the 50-yard freestyle f?r. Psi Up- silon, and Dave Pittmos took a share of first place in the backstroke. Other individual winners were Stuart Lazarus of Delta Upsilon in both the but- terfly and the individual med- ley, Glen Rapoport of Phi Sig- ma Delta in the 100-yard free- style, and James Clements of Sigma Phi in the breaststroke. Ey NINO DENEFRIO With Coach Bob Leonard back from sabbatical leave and an abundance of low early sea- son scores, the golf team is pointing towards a successful season. Based on the four best of fiye qualifying rounds, the number one and two men are sophomores, Doug Vergith and Ward El um. Vergith shot a low total of 300 for a 18 hole average of 75 and was charac- terized by Coach Leonard as, \very consistent.\ The t h i r d, fourth and sixth positions are held by three senior golfers, John Hine, Rich Horsman, and Jeff Smith while junior Rich Critchlow and soph Lonnie Pal- mer numbers five and seven, complete the first seven start- ing positions. All seven start- ers averaged rounds of 80 or lower, an optimistic sign con- sidering th.e conditions of the team's course, the Northway Heights, this early in the sea- son.

Golf was a popular sport for the Garnet in the 1950's under the direction of Professor Clare Graves, but the team was disbanded in 1960 for the lack of a home golf course. The squad was resurrected in 1966, and placed under the con- trol of Trainer Bob Leonard with the new Walhalla course used for practice. A second- place finish in the I CAC tour- ney highlighted the return of golf to Union. Last year, plagued by the lack of a coach and a home course, only four golfers came out for the team, and as a re- sult the team competed in only three matches.

'71 Stickmen Take Opening Win, 18-l By JAY BLI1'ZMAN The frosh 'lacrosse squad be- gan their season last Saturday at Garis Field with an overpow- ering perf<Hmance as they de- feated Stevens, 18-1. Coach Gary Brown's strategy in the opening stanza was to create one-on-one scoring op- portunities for Wayne Christie. For seven minutes Christie worl<ed for a score and once he connected, he and his team- mates went on a rampage which saw the Garnet grab a 7-0 first period lead. Wayne collected five goals and five assists, com- bined with Ned Dukehart to lead the Union attack. Duke- hart hit for six goals, convert- ing five of Christie's passes for markers. While the frosh performance was impressive it must be noted that Stevens was forced to sub- stitute quite fllequently. They only brought twelve men and consequently they could not cope with the depth on the Un- ion squad. Coach Brown util- ized four sets of midfields in exhausting the opposition. The few scoring opportunities the Stevens attack did have were adequately handled by goalies John Brown, and Dan Raplejae. Raplejae was impressive in the nets as was his defense which was forced to compensate for the sparing appearance of de- fensive star Pup Gould who sus- tained a groiiJ injury in the Darrow scrimmage. Curt Lin- dahl and Ken Jacoby perform- ed ably on defense, as did George Hobbs at attack, who played the eiJtire game in place of Ken Lorenz and notched a goal and two assists. Midfield- er Bruce Dugan had two goals and two assists, Don Hoover had one, as did Steve Berek, John Howell, and Ed Green.

Us- ing his 6-2, 207 pound size to full advantage, Milne excels at both ends of the field. His de- fense is bruising, to say the least, and he normally draws the high scorer of the opposi- tion as his assignment. He dominates most face offs, and J::tandles ground balls well. Ken notched eight goals last season, and twelve his soph year. He served notice of his offensive prowess Saturday with three goals and one assist as he led the scoring in a 6-4 victory over Stevens. His sta- bilizing effect oR the team is the key to hopes of an out- standing season.

A new grading scale will go into effect next fall as a result of action taken at a facu1ty coun- cil meeting held Tuesday after- noon. The council also approved the recent changes in the Con- vocation system passed on by the All College Council. The new grading scale, pro- posed by Professor Michael Shin- agel Chairman of the English Dep~rtment, ·is a 12-point scale interjecting pluses and minuses between each letter grade. After this proposal reached the coun- cil, it was further modified on suggestion of C. William Hunt- ley, Dean of the College, to in- clude corresponding decimal 0quivalcnts fer each grade from A to F. No A-Plus According to Shinagel, the new scale would \allow a more fair and clear grading system. You need to be able to distinguish between students more clearly. Some students most naturally fall into an A minus or B plus or B minus category. This sys- tem will help to assure that all students are treated fairly.\ There is no provision on the scale for an A-plus. \All you can reasonably ask for is a 4_0 for A work,\ Shinagel said. He also pointed out that an A-plus would create a \spurious distinctien\ between students in Center I and Center II; as the grading stand- ards in many Center I areas, Independents Meet Again; Discuss Goals By STEVEN COLE Fifty students, two professors, and Dean of Students Charles S. Olton met in Schaffer Library Music Room Thursday in the second meeting for Independents this week. With freshman Paul Vivian and sophomore David Zapata acting as spokesmen, the meeting began with a list of goals and comments. Such ideas as lack of unity, lack of com- munication and lack of social alter- natives to fraternities were discussed in what the spokesmen called \a neb- ulous fashion.\ The various propo- sals of the \independent committee\ included establishing a sense of to- getherness, and ressurrection of last year's Davidson Committee that for- mulated independent parties in Fox and Davidson House lounges. Who Acts Most? such as English, are much more subjective. Yeas· and Nays Division I was nearly unani- mously in favor of the new scale. Division II, Social Sciences, was largely in favor, Division III, Natural Sciences, was badly split and Division IV, Engineering, largely opposed. Shinagel said he believes that the faculty will act soon to raise the minimum index required for Deans List. \If you have one- third of the class on Dean's List it loses much of its significance,\ he said. Huntley said he expect- ed the issue to be raised within the faculty council later in the spring. He said that the faculty and administration will probably wait for the benefit of one year's experience with the new scale be~ fore re-evaluating standards of eligibility, good standing and; others. The faculty council also con- curred with the new convoca- tion system proposed by the All College Council:.rhe new system will go into effect next fall. The old system w i 11 be in effect throughout this term. In addition to four speakers, Presi· dent Martin has been invited to in· troduce the teach-in. Scheduled speak- ers include: Prof. Donald Thurston of the History Dept. and Rev. Lloyd Duren of the Schenectady Area Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Viet- nam. In a second session Leon Van Dyke of the Brothers will speak on the current race crisis. Van Dyke, who has been a guest lecturer in several Union classes, will be followed by Ralph Boyd of the Schenectady NAA- CP. This teach-in. unprecedented at Union since the read-in of 1966 when three poets, including Galway Kinne! and several area professors, spoke out against American policy in Vietnam, will be \based upon a two way flow of communication rather than upon a lecture atmosphere,\ according to a letter sent to all students by the Campus Action Committee. Bulldozers Yield Floral Gaiety The committee stressed that its proposals were open to discussion. They proposed a study of the campus to determine such things as ••who are the most a c t i v e students at Union.\ The committee said that it was concerned with the idea of mak- ing the Union student proud of his schooL Vivian stated that the fra- ternities seem to have failed in es- tablishing this extremely important aspect.

All Eligible The Dean said all members of the above groups are eligible to occupy off-campus billets, providing they are not on disciplinary probation. He added that he fells that next Year's senior, and possibly some jun- iors, will be eligible to live off cam'p- us. Any member of the present junior class, not on disciplinary probation, may submit his name, together with prospective roomates. Each group of for a lottery, as will each student who wishes to live alone. Students should submit their names to Dean Lucas in Fox Hall by noon Tuesday, April 30. The lottery will be helc.: that after- noon. Not Likely Juniors Lucas said it it not likely that juniors will be allowed to live off- campus but if openings are available, a similar lottery will be held for them. The dean said he is awaiting fur- ther information to determine the number of stu.dents who will be al- lowed to live off campus, but he expects the number to exceed 50. Requests of those not picked in the lottery will be saved, in the event than an overflow housing situation develops in the Fall. Sign-ups will begin May 1 for hous- ing on campus next year. Upperclass- men can anticipate to be housed in Davidson and Fox Halls. South Col- lege will be open to upperclassmen as well; North Colle~e will not be used for student housing. between the Library and the Social Sciences and Humanities Buildings. Behind them will be shrubs and flow- ering trees. Immediately in front of the Library concrete, dirt, flowers, and grass wili scramble about to work out a puzzle of floral arrangements surrounding a plaza. Beds of annuals color in spring and summer will be bedded with flowering crabs, hawthorns, fire- thorns, pink oak, and black pine. Benches will be placed on the plaza to eliminate squating on soapboxes and the grass during speeches. Next Year Replacing tb.e well-worn foot paths of summer and mud holes of winter will be new concrete walkways re- directed to speed traffic to and from dorms and the library. Though actual work will be completed sometime next month, the beauty of the project will not be evident until next year. The plaza project, officially titled the Center Area project, represents the efforts of the Parents of Union College. Their gifts and donations along with borrowed money from funds set up by the Trustees, provide the $B5,000 needed for the work. Designed for a summer chapel, the plaza will serve for commencement enjoyment, discussion, and a forum for speakers. Besides the plaza project; other bits of leaf and petal will begin to appear about the campus. Little- leaf linden will move in on the Dutch elms, evergreens will sprout around Fox and Davidson Houses, and flow- ering tr~es 1 shrubs, and ground cover will do the1r song and dance at differ- ent palladiums admidst the buildings. Dean Huntley, chairman of the fac- ulty committee which planned the project, said \the Center Campus is Union's front yard and deserves very careful treatment.\ Landscaping architects for the porj- ect are John G. Litnyski of Burnt Hills and George A. Roberts of Nis- akyuna. United Tree Service is the General Contractor, with Bason Con- struction Corporation as grading sub- contractor. An immediate proposal was the sponsoring of a party for Spring Weekend. The spokesmen emphasized that such an event would be nothing monumental, but would indicate a \show of force.\ The -spokesmen then opened the meet i n g for suggestions and com- ments. Some students felt that the proposed idea of a constitution would be a \waste of time and energy\ al- though some felt that nothing could be harmed by having one. New Ideas Many felt that the problem was that there was a sense of fragmenta- tion. In reference to the lack of com- munication one student proposed that \we form a school newspaper and call it Concordiensis and then after this was underway we could form a radio station and perhaps call it WRUC.\ Other comments from the floor in- cluded the discussion of the College Center which many agreed was the main problem. Then the question: \who would one take to the center?\; this in turn brought out the discus- sion of Union going co-ed. Another proposal for the committee was that it could be instrumental in pushing for delayed fraternity rushing and pledging only in the sophomore year. The point was made that no sooner is a student situated at Union before he must begin giving his loyalty to a sub-organization - a fraternity. Some suggested that this is the cause of the anti-fraternity sentiment which some felt prevails among independents. And Admissions Too Discussions of recruiting \the right kind of student\ for Union was pro- posed as a function of the committee. Some proposed discussing with the Admissions Department what they're looking for in a student. Dean Olton told the group that he was in the process of doing a study on various fraternities across the country and our own 16 fraternities. He stated that his study was not in direct criticism of Union's fratern- ities but a general survey. With the idea of getting representa- tion in the student council. the meet- ing adjourned with the understanding that the next meeting would discuss more concrete plans and actions. The spokesmen assured the p.:roup that it would be an open meetmg. · A panel discussion of a student's military committment will be one of the major innovations in next year's fres~man orientation program, ac- cordmg to Dean of Students Charles Olton. The orientation committee consist- ing of Olton, Dean Richard Lucas, Ross Fraser, and Grady Aronstamm is taking a fresh approach to next fall's program with emphasis on the elim- mation of \recruiting\ activities by various campus organizations. Olton stated that since students come to col- lege because they are interested in ideas, more discussions on key issues should be included. Mother Stabbers For the military committment dis- .cussion, the committee is asking a representative from the Reserve Offi- cers Training Corps, a person from the local army or navy recruiting center, a member of the faculty who opposes R.O.T.C. on educational grounds, and a fourth person, either a conscientious objector or a draft card burner, to participate. Each man will be given a chance to speak and then the discussion will be opened. Another topic for a debate may be self expression and social rebellion. This would deal with the different means - drugs, the hippie culture, political activism, social work, etc- by which young people cope with the world. Pop Mass It has been decided that the pres- entation of intercollegiate sports will be included in the discussion with in- tramural and club sports. This will show students the variety of athletics available. Because orientation will begin on a Saturday, the committee is tenta- tively considering the idea of holding a \Pop Mass\ on Sunday. There will also be a change from the required reading of two books during the summer. The committee hopes to take a multi-media approach with the addition of a play or poetry reading. Group discussions with fac- ulty members will be held on a more informal basis.

Ed TPsslet Moving-Up Day Last Tuesday the Fac1:1lty Council meeting became \Moving-Up Day\ for Unio11's academic standards witt the approval of the revised gradiNg system. We exped this new system to be a significant factor in improving the intellectual atmosphere of the college. A more specific grading scale such as this provides a greater challenge to both faculty and students. Faculty members now are more able to give a student a. more pre· cise grade for his effort. This implies that Jlrofessors will be more careful and exact in evaluating student efforts. The great effect of this scale, however, will hope· fully be to further motivate students to study harder and achieve more. Professors should be glad to be able to grade students more fairly, as this system allows. Students, how- ever, will find it harder to \squeak out\ an A or B. No longer will they be able to go through finals week with a minimum of study. There is somehow a large gap betweer. a B, a B-minus and a C-plus. Union is not nearly as competitive a school or af intellectually-oriented an institution as are some other colleges. One can walk through the campus on weekend~ and count on his fingers and toes the number of student~: studying. During the week any acceptable distraction pre· sents a good opportunity to god' off. We hope that with its advantages and obvious dis- advantages, the new grading scale will have the intended effect, not only of making grades fairer, but more im· portantly, of motivating the student body to higher aca- demic achievement within the more eompetitive atmos- phere likely to result from this move. Union can well afford to raise her academic ·standards and we hope that students will rise to meet them. Sy~nposiun~ Sing Along Tothe Editor: The singing of \America the Beautiful\ was insulting and totally inappropriate in the march of two Sundays ago in honor of the late Martin Luther King. It is to vent my disgust and to answer the bewildered looks on many faces that I am writing this letter. To dilude oneself into think- ing that America is beautiful at a time like this is truly pathe\ ~ic. I can not begin to fathom tl,le black man's anguish for I am white. Dr. King could - \when your first name becomes 'nigger,' your middle name be- comes 'boy' (no matter how old you are) and you are har- ried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, never quite knowing what to exp,ect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentment; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of 'no bodiness' - then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.\ As long as the ember waves of grain are for a select few, as long as the amber waves of ed to steal in order to partake of the fruited plain, America will be far from beautiful. The roaring voice of the drum major is stilled - but only in sound. Already it is resur- rected in abortive births of vio- lence. And as long as we wal- low in complacency, violence ~ill J?revail; we might as well s1t m1dst our purple mountain's majesties and wait for the hot summers. LESLIE PETROVICS C'hoice '68 To the Editor: April 24 is an important day on this campus. CHOICE 68 the national student preside~tial preference primary will give Union an opportunity to express her views on candidates and the pressing issues of the day. I urge my fellow students to cooperate and participate to the fullest extent of heir capabil- ities. THEODORE SE'I'H STEINGUT New Purpose To the Editor: Now that the students of Union College have succeeded in eliminating the Convocation requirement, I should like to submit a proposal for their con- sideration. Why not have three scheduled Convocations, one each semes- ter, by members of the Union faculty who are chosen by the ent~re stu~ent body the pre- cedmg sprmg? The chosen fac- ulty members would prepare talks on topics of moment to the campus community and the titles of their talks would be issued early in the fall semester with the year's Convocation schedule. These three Convo- cations would complement the program of outside speakers and performers selected by a joint student-faculty Convocation com- mittee. The attractions of such a scheme seem to me severaL First, since the students alone would choose the three faculty speakers by majority vote, it · seems reasonable to expect that · they would turn out to hear The proposal by Professor Shinagel that students select them speak. Second, the talents of some of the Union faculty a number of faculty members to present convocation pro- would get a broader and more g rams on topics of interest to the campus community is one public exposure than the con- fines of their classrooms, and which Concordiensis heartily endorses. faculty members would have the rare privilege of witnessing their colleagues perform in a Many of our faculty members are distinguished within context other than that of de- partment or committee or gen- faculty Convocation speakers who would not have to be paid for their services. Fourth, the editor of Symposium would thri'll to the prospect of three guaranteed annual contributions on timely topics to that worthy publication. Fifth, the students, faculty, and administration of Union College would come to know that sense of community which teaches us that we don't have to turn instinctively to the outside world for instruction and direction, that we too have our strengths and ideas, and that we too can achieve a pur- pose and respect among our- selves. MICHAEL SHINAGEL Misconceived To the Editor: We wish to voice an opm1on which we :£eel is particularly relevant in light of the fact that Choice '68 is being held next week. It concerns sev- eral misconceptions about the college student and national politics. One is the notion that the only two alternatives for youth aru Senators Kennedy and McCarthy. Anyone who believes that has obviously studied the candidates only as far as it suited his preconceived beliefs_ Conformity is as pre- valent in this situation as it is in any other. This is the year to be ' 1 clean for Gene\ or on the Bobby bandwagon, so why be different? We believe that there is an alternative (for the nation as well as for students) and that alternative is Richard Nixon. The second misconception on the part of the ••activists\ and others whom we have talked to concerns Mr. Nixon himself. Their images of him appear to be founded on no facts, but hearsay, not ideas but hackney- ed phrases. Is this any way to make a national choice? We believe not. In conclusion, we urge all Union students to vote in Choice '68. It is the best way of making our voice heard. But if it is not the voice of intelli- gent, informed people, of what good is it? Before voting study the candidate carefully. We have, and we have concluded that Richard Nix:on is the best choice in Choice in '68.

Scl:l!lnec::tady FR 4-8219 Fride~y, April 19, 1968 Black Alliance Angered; Caainl Unfair Admissions It is noteworthy to mention in recognizing such recent articles -t as the Apri·l14th New \\ork Times article, \More Negroes Accepted by lvy League Colleges\ the April 11th Concm:dy article, \Lack of Blacks\ and the recent statements of Dr. Nevitt Sanford, Pro- fessor of Phychology and Education at Stanford University, last ., Thursday at the convocation that new policies and more stringent efforts are needed in relationship to getting more Black Americans at Union. . The Ivy League colleges have admitted for -this faH a greatly ,.. mcreased number of \Negro students\ largely as a result of recl'uit- ing efforts by campuses' own Afro-American Student groups. Wh-ile this effort is very commendabte, something must be said about the admissions' department's efforts. While Union College has made efforts, their efforts are not good enough. Irresponsible We, the Black Alliance, therefore, must request more stringent efforts and offer our help in recruiting these students. As The Concordy notes: \It is irresponsible and mora11y negligent to go about recruiting a freshmen class for Union College without trying to include a meaningful number of Black students.\ We ave ! cognizant of \old traditions\ and statements like \lowering of standards\ but we draw attention to Mr. Sanford, again, as he stated; \Colleges should take steps to admit four percent of their students _fro:t;n those ~ho have college boards below average, but ~ have potiential recogmzed by counselors, and although this would only be a drop in the bucket it would triple the number of minor- ities in colleges.\ Many Negro students don't have the courage to apply because of rumors of snobbery and excessive 11equirements. Denial of such statements comes under the heading of Admissions. Letters can be sent to Blacks who are National Merit Scholarship finalists and semi-finalists. And after these letters are sent, an all-out effort must be made to follow them up. It should match the nergy with which the linebacker from Central High is constantly bombed with letters te11ing him all the great advantages of \an independent undergraduate, residential college for men of high academi~ promise, strong personal motivation, and distinct capacity for ~ leadership.\ Hypocrisy ·• As Albany State is doing, summer sessions could be insti· gated to help \less qualified\ students. Something has to be done. \The hypocrisy\ manifested in a handful of Black Americans at Union must not reach any greater heights. We are also cognizant ·I of the financial problem at Union. But we also draw attention to the financial burden being put on the college by the mass \beautifi- cation project\ presently taking place in front of Schaefer Library. In summation, we would like to invite the Admissions De- '' partme!lt to reply to this article. Perhaps many of the statements in the article are weak. Surely a response can have no dysfunctional aspects. \'-- l...ux.ury On A Hot Summer Day .... ~·· This zephYJ.·-weight suit is all J quality.

The first complete tabulation and analysis in history of the voting preferences of a nation- wide segment of the U.S. popu- lation will be made during CHOICE 68, the first national collegiate presidential primary. on April 24. The primary i~ co-sponsored by Time Magazine and the Univac Division of Sperry Rand Corporation. Votes on presidential candi- dates and important national issues, such as the Vietnam war, win be processed from an anticipated turnout of over 2,000,000 students from nearly 1,500 coHeges representi11g more than 75% of the nation's total college enrollment. Over 70% of the students expressing their preference in CHOICE 68 are expected to be under the common minimum legal voting age of 21. The basic data on the ballot shows the voter's age and party; whether he is a foreign student; his first, second and third choices for president among 13 listed candidates plus write-ins; the course of action which he believes the U.S. should pursue in regard to her military forces in Vietnam; the course of ac- tion she should :pursue regard- ing the bombing of North Viet- nam; and the area o'f govern· ment spending which should re- ceive highest priority to meet the urban crisis. From about 2,000;0()0 ballots, a computer will tabulate per- centages of the total vote for each candidate, and the percen- tage of students favming each course of action in the refer- enda. At their campus .polling places, students push out per· forations on computer cards to indicate their preferences. Af- ter the .primary, a detailed re· port on all aspects of CHOICE 68, including fu,rther analyses of the returns, will be pub- lished. Tlte voti-ng on Union College's campus will be condu.cted as follows: All freshmen wiU vote in the West College lou.nge, op- posite the dining room between 5:30 and 8:00 p.m., A.pril 24.

The big blows of the four run second inning were two- run singles by Mike McGee and Brian Gidlow, while the four- run third was 'built on a pair of errors and run producing sin- gles by Ken Merchant, who . drove in three runs in the game, ami Jim Wilson. McGee's booming triple across the running track in right fol- lowed by Gidlow's single pro- duced the Garnet's final taHy in the sixth. The 1\lariners reached Neidel for a pair of runs in the fourth on three consecutive doubles but otherwise the tall right- hander- was very effective, strik- ing <Jttt five while issuing two free :passes. Douglas worked two strong innings, but was touched for an unearned run in the ninth. Now They're 0-4 King's Point is usually strong in baseball, playing a much more difficult schedule than the Garnet. However, entering Wednesday's contest the Mar- iners were 0-3, having lost to St. John's, LIU, and Wagner. The Garnet nine travels to Drew and Stevens this week- end where a pair of victories would put them on the road to a very successful year. Stev- ens' last victory over Union came in 1956, and overall the Garnet have won 22 of 33 games from the Stutemen. Bob Hal- lenbeck, recently elected cap- tain will pitch Friday, while Neidel wiU probably start on Saturday, Tracknten Fall, 76-62 Win .. ln Ten Events .By HENRY FEIN In rnost track meets, the team that wins most of the events usually wins the meet with little trouble. The Garnet varsity won ten of sixteen events at Trinity Tuesday, but a lack of depth led to a 76-62 defeat. Sparkling individual performances could not make up for the general lack of man- power that looks to plague the Dutchmen all season. Pete Ericson, AI Sessoms, and Carl Thumm made a shambles of the sprints and middle dis- tances, but the Garnet lost val- uable JJOints in the runners-up spots. Ericson took the 100 in 10.5, while Sessoms easily won the 220 (22.6) and the 440 ( 4!l.9 , only a tenth of a second off the Union all-time record). Thumm showed great promise as he captured the half-mile in 1:58.8. Shortage Fatal The severe shortage of dist- ance runners was fatal, as the Bantams swept both the mile and tw<J mile. Trinity also cap- tured the high and intermedi- ate hurdle events, but the Gar- net dominated the relays. Eric- son, Dave Gray, Thumm and Sessoms teamed up to win the mile relay in 3:31.5. Fitz Turn- er high jumped 6', only 7/8\ off the Union record. Art Mc- Cabe won the long jump, leap- ing 21' 3Vz\. Ed Blechner eas- ily won the discus, while Tom Oberst's winning javelin toss was 172'10\. Although the frosh were sur- prised by a deep Trinity squad, a number of the young Garnet performed outstandingly. Steve MacKenzie ran a highly promis- ing 63.8 in the intermediate hurdles. High jumper Bob Ber- ger cleared 6', and pole vaulter Scott Wager went over the bar at 12'6\. Terry McManus was all over the field, placing in the triple jump, half mile, and javelin, and running a leg of the mile relay.

Due to the fact that the frosh do not play their next scheduled game until April 23 when they visit Syracuse, Coach Brown scheduled the scrimmage against the Al- bany contingent which draws its material from freshmen through seniors. The first half of play was completely dominated by Albany, which was especially effective on exploiting fast break oppor- tunities right up the middle. The defense, with Pup Gould sidelined, was severely test- ed, as was Dan Raplejae in the goal. Entering the last half trail- ing 6-2, the Garnet settled down. The attack, Wayne Christie, Ken Lorenze, and Ken Dukehart began to play as the powerful coordinated scoring punch it can be. Mid- fielders Ed Green and Bruce Dugan were extremely effec- tive. Dugan pumped in four unassisted goals in the sec- ond half and helped the Gar- net to control the tempo o·f the game and create several scoring opportunities. Down 11-7 at the start of the final quarter the frosh battled back to an 11-11 tie. In the overtime period the frosh fell behind 13-12 but rallied in the closing seconds, pres- sing for a score. With only ten seconds to go in the con- test and Union in possession of the ball and apparently threatening, the referee inex- plicably called a face off which ran out the clock. Syracuse, Cortland Head Strong CNY Division By L·EN SIMON The lacrosse team may be about to find out what tough competition really is. After traveling north this weekend to take on weak Clarkson and St. Lawrence, they visit Syracuse Tuesday for their first contest in the newly formed Central New York Division.. The Central New York Division, made UP· of the Garnet and their fi·ve toughest opponents, is part of a totalily new alignment for national collegiate lacrosse. Last year Union was a member of the Kelse Morrill Division, and could normally expect to be in the 1 top half .of the league, barring disaster. This year, however, it is 1 not inconceivable for Union. to place at either the top or bottom t, of the CNYD, considering the calibre of competition. Toughest Opposition Syracuse, right now, loo·ks to be the toughest opposition the ' Garnet will face this season. The Orangemen are 2-2. They have beaten Washington College 10-9 and RPI 15-2. Washington was number five nationally last season, and RPI normally ranks about on a par with Union. Syracuse losses have been to perennial na- tional champion Navy, 14-0, and to Ivy League power Cornell, 15-6. The Orangemen have had two consecutive undefeated fr.eshman teams. Hobart stands. at 3-1, most recently downing Colgate 12-6. The • Statesmen hold some sort of mystical spell over Union, the last 1 Garnet victory coming in 1942. Last year the Garnet fell 4-3 and a 8-7 loss in 1966 ruined a perfect season for the Garnet. Cortland trounced the Dutchmen 14-5 last year, but revenge wiH not be easy to come by as they showed considerable strength while fa1'ling to Cornell 8-2. Comparative scores here would put them at least on a par with Syracuse. On Wednesday the Staters dropped a 13-12 decision to C. W. Post. ,,· RPI lost its big names from last year's team, but has made some str-ong showings in compiling a 2-1 record thus far. Aside from falling to Syracuse, the Engineers have beaten Siena 13•5, and Ste!fens, 10-5. Both scores indicate slight superiority to Union ' efforts against the same two teams. Colgate 2·2 Colgate stands at 2-2, showing victories over Lehigh and Lafayette, while taking it on the chin from Hobart and Williams, the latter by an 8-4 score. The Red Raiders, right now, look to be the weakest team in the league, but the discrepancy between the top and bottom of the six-team loop is. not very much. Aside from this division, set up purely for lacrosse, Union also competes in the ICAC, as it does in most other sports. Here the competition is less severe, with Union, Hobart and RPI almost •! , certain of making up the first division of the league. St. Law- rence looks good for fourth, while Alfred and Clarkson should battle it out for the cellar. \·~~··-· _,enmtionul <C.en.ter!\ JAcndtrtnir: Jm.eg~rm:h -~- , 1492 COMMONWEALTH AVENUE BOSTON I MASSACHUSETTS 02135 •' I I The International Center for Academic Research is designed to help every student achieve his maximum potential in the subject, or subjects, of their choice. · 1 el I We at The International Center for Academic Research are proud that these out- standing instructional techniques hove shown proven results for decades.

After brief discussion, the Council voted with only one op· posing, to back the Student Strike. In addition, Pete W ollensak explained a further Campus Action Committee project; a fast by all the students who usually eat at West College.

Giving more than a glimpse of the atmosphere of world diplomacy for an hour to a large audience in Social Science 016, the ambassador drew on his experiences as a colonial of- ficial, a Commonwealth administrator and trouble-shooter, and as a repre· sentative in the UN General Assem- bly and Security Council. He described what be hopes and be· lieves is the new style in international affairs: negotiation and arbitration rather than the ancient practice of power politics. The Ambassador described the broadening but sometimes disappoint- ing experience of working at the UN. He sits between the United Republic Deutsch To Discuss Nevv Methodology Karl Deutsch, one of the fore- most figures in political science in America today will speak on Friday at 4 :30 in the Social Sci- ence~ Auditorium. His talk en- titled, \New Methodologies in Po- litical Science\ is sponsored by the International Relations Club and the Center for Humanities. Deutsch was born and edu- cated in Czechoslovakia and came to America in 1938. He was a professor of political sci- ence and history at MIT frorn 1942 to 1958, and a professor .of political science at Yale frorn , 1958 to 1967 when he moved to • Harvard. During that time Deut- sch has held fellowships at many schools, including Princeton and the University of Chicago.

Lax, B-Ball Svveep Hourigan Stars Orange Hext Foe As Team Bflts .314 Offense Explodes By GARY PREVOS'f If any doubts were still held about the hitting power of the 1968 Garnet nine, they were convincingly buried on a two day road trip in New Jersey. On Friday, Bob Hallenback pitched a four-hit shutout as the Dutchmen buried Drew 15-0. Stevens Tech fell victom to four Garnet round-trippers and lost 15-3 to Bill Neidel and the Dutchmen the next day. Against Drew, three big innings ac- counted for all but one of the Garnet tallies as Mike Solomon, Ken Mer- chant, Brien Gidlow, and Jim Wilson each collected a pair of hits. Hallen- back was overpowering in seven inn- ings of pitching, as he struck out elevent while walking only two. Joe Douglas worked a shutout inning be- fore the slaughter was terminated by mutual consent of the coaches. Saturday's rout was led by Dave Hourigan's four-for-five performance, which included a pair of solo hom- ers. Ken Merchant contributed three hits to top off a five-for-eight week- end, while Milte Solomon and Bob MacKenzie each slapped home runs with a man on base. The Garnet nine, which totaled fif- teen hits in the game, put the contest out of reach with a seven-run third inning while lanky Bill eidel pitched Continued on Page 4 By LEN SIMON The moment of truth is fast ap- proaching! Coming off an easy week- end up North, the lacrosse taam trav- els to Syracuse today to face the powerful Orangemen, most likely its most formidable foe this season. Syracuse is rebuilding lacrosse, try- ing to get back to the power it had moved the Orange to national stat- ture. The last confrontation of the Orange with the Garnet resulted in a 12-2 Union victory in 1966. Since. then, however, they have fielded two consecutive undefeated frosh teams and now boast the power to tackle 3i rugged schedule of national powers. They must be regarded the favorite in the Central New York Division by virtue of their 15-2 victory over RPI. They stand 3-2, having defeated Penn State 13-9 over the weekend. Key operatives for Syracuse are attackmen Laverne Doctor and Noble. A midfielder named Pappas seems to ' have been around for over a decade, Continued on Page 4 of Tanzania and the United Arab Re- public, two countries his government on!y recently resumed diplomatic re- lations with, yet became good friends with both representatives. \It is im- portant to know who is sitting around you while searching for common ground for reconciliation,\ he said. Despite criticism of UN effective- ness, Lord Caradon believes that it has achieved much good. ·'When the UN ceases to reflect the troubles of the world,\ he answered a question, \that is the time to stop worrying. Saying there is trouble in the UN is like saying there is sick- ness in a hospital.\ The UN is help- ing to adv~nce the cause of reconcili- ation. The most dramatic moment in his UN career came when Malta, one of the smallest countries in the world, came forward with a proposal that would look forward to the preserva- tion of maritime resources for future world generations. The big countries, though suspicious at first, listened, and an Assembly vote passed unani- mously. Listening to Lord Caradon, one is impressed with the intelligence sav- oir-faire and obvious international perspective that has apparently dis- tinguished his career. If he is not the last of the old line of statesmen who manned an empire, but one of the first of a new breed of diplomats such as U Thant, there may be hope for a world system ruled by reason rather than righteousness. · children who come from poverty back- grounds. The Council appeared anxious to approve the p:coject, especially after it was pointed out that Saga Foods was not willing to take part unless it was assured of Student Council sup- port. However, rather than close the dining hall to all, with non-participa· tors given their lunch at Hale House free with their meal tickets, the Coun- cil decided that the initiative for this action should come from those who were involving themselves, and that those who did not want to be in- cluded sl'lould not have to be put out of their way. Although it was antici- pated that a large majority of stu- dents would take part, the Council voted 17-4 that a list be made of those fasting, and Saga would contribute in relations to the number of meals that it did not have to prepare. The Student Council also passed un- amiously a motion by Ed Blechner the Student Council passed unani- mously a motion by Ed Blechner which gave the support of the Coun- cil to the recently formed Black Alliance. At the general faculty meeting on Thursday, there will be a presentation regarding the question of Union's con- tribution to the readjustment of America with an eye towards racial balance. The primary focus will be an investigation of the College's own resources and limitations.

2 , Retort .. To the Editor: I ~m proud of the fact tllat at Union College the faculty takes enougll interest in the sch10ol and tne students to mak:e major innovations in the structure of the <'O Jlege; such as the \T.hr ee- Three\ system and the rec~mtly pass(!d change in the grading systeJn. However, I lind It .high- ly anfortunate that the facLL!ty did n()t even think so much of the st11dents as to undertake a fair sampling of the opimon on the }lr())>osed change. The thing that gneves me more than that is the fact that we have a cam- pus n~wspaper that surely re- ile~ts the alleged low academic stcm<lar.d at Union by spe~ial­ izing in Exaggerated, inaccarate, inane, and Irresponsible journ- alism. I refer to the latest edi- torial, \l\ioving Up Day.\ According to the Ed1tor, the ne1v s;ystem of grading wiJ:l p·re- sent a gt·eater challenge to both faculty and students, and it im- plies that the professors wilil be m<lre careful in evaluating the studen~s' efforts. If by this he means that the professors today do not take care in evaluating stud~nts' work I think he is not onl\f being unfair to the faeu lty but dead wrong. The Editor states that it will no longer be possible to take finals with a minimum of study, and that the stud('n.ts will be motivated to studs harder and achieve more. Perha_ps he has glided throu.gh final examinations with a mini- mum (){ work, but for the rEst of us it usually takes a maxi- mum of effort. The Editor rnis- takes ihE word study for what should be \cram.\ Now the stu- dent will not be able to feel the least bit confident of a grade lle- fOI:e finals but will live in a state of anxiety (how deli(!ious a :prospect! l. Cramming llard- er does not necessarily achieve a higher intellectual atm os- pheJ.'\e. 'The Editor appears to be forlorn over the fact that Union is n<lt as competitive as some other colleges, and he C'()l'- roborate:s his theory with some fanc:y toE and finger calculati.on he has done on the number of people studying on the week- end. HE has quite evidently nevev gone to a \competitive sc llool and therefore considers himself an expert on its ad- vant<tges. He seems to be of the }le1suasion that students are inlle:vently bad and that taey should be pressurized in order to r(!c~ive an education. I I:Je- lieve that it is not only possible but highly desirable to receive a g()od education and at the same tirne enjoy it without be- ing bludgeoned by unnecessary rivab()US competition. There are several important reas<Jns that students have dted to 1etain the present grading system at Union. For me there is one above all. I have been to a \(mnpetitive\ scho<ll whicb. had a decimal grading system. and must say that it is not that ad if one doesn't know any b,et- ter. I arn an upperclassman and will h~rdly be affected by the new graqing system, but I am con~erned at what I think might happen to Union. At the pr~s­ ent, there is a big margin on exam grades which distingui:sh- es a leiter grade. That is to say. that there is a difference o:f ten or fifteen exams points in a letter grade. Under the nEw svste~n if thPre were an ercor mad<e on the correction of some- one's exam of two of three points it would mean a different .se- mesteJ.'\ grade for that indhrid- ual. This can only lead to stu- dents arguing with their pro- fessors and squabbling over a few disputed points. It will not only t~x the students and p:ro- fessors alike bu.t will be a great sour~e of annoyance. U11ion College wishes to n1()Ve in a progressive direction in ed- ucatlon I am certain; and b..opes to elevate itself in the academic world. I don't think it can be denied that the ideal grading system would be on a Pass·Yail basis.

Office, Dron- level have recently endeavored to reach this goal. After over 150 years Yale University final- ly revised its grading system to a form which is essentially t'he same as what we presently have at Union. If it has taken Yale and other schools 1ilre it all this time to progress to the point where we are today why should we turn in the exact op- posite direction by adding more structu·re to our grading system, and in doing so, get further away from the ideal It seems as though that in their zeal to get Union on the l'l:Jad to a new plateau of academic excellence, the faculty has perhaps fouled the gears and thrown the car into reverse. KENNETH GOLDMAN What Price, Glory? To the Editor: Your viewp<lint, as stated in last week's editorial, was that the hope was that the new grad- ing system would promote a better academic atmosphere on the campus. I beheve that this is an idealistic approach to the proposition, and that in reality just the opposite will result. The student now who has a high C will often turn on the steam to pull out a B and thereby mater· ially better his index, but a stu· dent with a C + will not be nearly as likely to turn on the steam for only a B- result (even though that is all he :prob- ably deserves). Also, the stu· dent who settles for a \gentle- man's C\ will stiH settle for one; his problem is rooted in his ap- proach to studying, and he is not going to alter his pattern to work for a C +. I completely be· lieve that the new grading sys. tern is going to have absolutely no effect on the intellectual at· mosphere of the college, and further, any effect that it may have is toward diluting the re· wards for extra study pat in, therefore making extra study less attractive than it is now. I am not aware of the effect that \PASS - FAIL\ grading has had at other colleges, but it seems to be the prevailing trend in grading systems today. One might note that what is being done here is a step in the op· posite direction. One might also notice that it is the liberal arts departments that are backing this proposal. This is entirely reasonable; they are the ones who can bene· fit from this system. In science and engineering, it is difficult to pull out the n~~t higher grade without a pos1t1ve proof of extra work manifested in more problems done and higher exam grades. In many liberal arts courses, it is possible to ''bull\ your way to a higb.er grade on an exam which may allow many interpretations <lf any given set of questions, ';L'he liberal arts professors are JUSt asking for a way to make a finer distinction between two essays which are reasonably close but not quite equal. In science and engineering, there just isn't that much difference in the long run between a 73 and a 77, or for that matter between a 78 and an 82. But it is easy to justi!'Y making a 78 average into a B m science on the basis of problems done or points of insight dem· onstrated on a paper. In many cases in liberal arts. the differ- ence between the C + and the B- is a subjective judgment based on a guess <lf how much of the reading that the student did was understood and inter· preted. The new grading pro· posals make this subjective guess much more of an exading measure. Thus the new grading system allows the liberal arts departments to furth~r differ· entiate between two papers or exams that are essentially dif· ferent to begin with, while it forces the science and engine~r­ ing departments to make a. diS· tinction line where essentially none should exist.

PETER HATHAWAY, '68 Pursuit To the Editor : This Friday, as most people ,probably lmow, there wHI be a boycott of classes and a Teach· In. The purpose of these activi· ties will be to focus concern on American foreign poiicy and the American racial crisis. The per· tinent question is what effect will the Teach-In have on the college community. I have heard several types of objections raised to the Teach- In and I would Hke to propose some answers. I have heard people say t:hat it is not right to boycott classes. True, you are boycotting your classes, but you are not boycotting your educa- tion. The Teach-In should truly be an educational experience no matter where you stand in rela· tion to the Vietnam war or the racial crisis. Both of these issues face us a.s students, as Ameri- cans and most of all as human beings. Why not be concerned with these issues, rather than being our usual apathetic selves? I have heard students say, but it is senior weekend! I suspect that in almost all cases this is a rationalization rather than a legitimate reason. To be drink- ing or to he preparing for the weekend in other ways, while such a creat·ive educational ex- perience is at hand is to be guilty of bace selfishness. Sure- ly any concerned student will b~ able to find some time for the Teach-In. I have heard still other stu- dents say, \It's just that dirty old campus Action Committee again.\ Anybody with half a brain can see that this is sim- ply another rationalization. Since when should concern be the private possession of any tivism must ·be the property of one group in the society? Ac- all classes for to the degree that any society is complacent it is dead! The appalling aspect of Union College students, as anybody knows is their apathy. So many students here are against the war and against the racial big- otry in this country, but how many students do anything for these causes. Sure, a Teach-In is not going to end the war or end racial bigotry. For you who are apathetically inclined, a Teach-In might help to show that there is not enough money or dedication in the United States to fight in Vietnam and to solve our racial problem. You might even learn something to help support your opinions. You who are for the war or believe that the racial problem will cure itself could not ask for a better <lpportunity to hear the other side of the question. You might even learn something of value. It is unfortunate that there will be those who are afraid to come or who feel that it is none of their business. Finally, I would like to an- swer those who feel that I have no business writing this letter.

If intel· lectualism ends at the class· room door; if intellectualism does not mean concern about the revelant issues of the day; if intellectualism means that you do not listen to the other side of the question; if intellect· ualism does not mean a serious attitude toward life and if in· tellectualism means that .there is no correlation between an ed- ucation and the world, then we are dead. Worse than being dead, 1t means that we wiU slowly die as apathy chokes us and as prob- lems overcome us. It means that we wiH eat of the fruit of life, but get no nourishment from 1t. ~o, to those who criticize me I say where is your intellectual· ism? Is it a vital part of you or something you leave behind in the pursuit of life? Sincerely, GRA:DY C. ARONSTA.MM' Attack· An Open Letter to Eugene Kokot: There is probably no enter- prise as worthy as a demonstra- tion of concern over the major problems of the day. By the same token, there is no Iower form of irresponsibility than an attitude of apathy toward these considerations. But we are :puz. zled as to your committee's planned student str1ke intended to demonstrate concern ever the war -in Vietnam as well as over the crisis caused by racial un· rest in this country.\ Is this merely a demonstration of a concern or is it in fact in sup· port of a particular point of view? Of course, there can be only one point of view in regard to the racial crisis, one which calls for the eradication of pre- judices or hypocritical attitudes on the .pal't of white Americans. On this, all men of good faith agree. But your concern over the Vietnam war is a different matter. Even our nation's lead· ers have been unable to reach a conclusion. Although you have done your best to obscure yoar point of view in your letter, it is not hard to ascertain. If your demonstration is to be an anti· war rally, then why do you not refer to it as such? Indeed, our main objection, Mr. Kokot. is not towaJ.1d your ends, but to· ward you.r means. In combining a Vietnam dem· onstratio11 with the civil rights problem, you have placed those who disagree with you on Viet- nam in the embarrassing posi- tion of being susceptible to mis· an attempt at psychological in· a nattempt at psychological in· timidation. In addition, by call- ing a stadent strike on the Fri- day afternoon before a big week· end, you can anticipate a tre- mendous number of people not going to class. But how saccess- ful would this demonstration be if it were held on a weeknight? Skidmore held a Vietnam Teach- In on a weeknight and attracted a large crowd. Why then, do you insist on interrupting a class day, when students, faculty, and interested local citizens have other commitments? We think it is because you are going to measure your success not by the number present at the Teach· In, but by the number of those who don't go to class. Surely you don't expect to attract near- ly as many people to yoll!' Teach-In as will cut class.

We pay a great deal of tT.eney for the privtlege of attending classes, and we will be denied that privilege this Friday. Yr u wHl most likely succeed in dis- rupting that day's classes and certainly no student-political or- ganization has the right to do that. WHY, THE COLLEGE DIBN''l' EVEN CANCEL CLAS- SES DURING MARTIN LUTH- ER KING'S FUNERAL!! Mr. Kokot, we applaud your comrnitfee for its concern and dedication. However, we must criticize the manner in which you e~ercise this concern. A Teach-In is a fine idea. But, calLing for a student strike is an irresponsible, disruptive ac- tion., md will be eagerly seized by many merely as an excuse to cut elasses. Many of your strik- ers wm be completely uncon· cerned with your efforts. In- deed, there will be many at the Teach-In who are likewise un· concerned, but are afraid that their disagreement with you over Vietnam wiH be misinter- preted as disagreement with the basic fundamentals of civil rights. However, there w;]l be some .of us, who, for reascns of conscience, will not be able to attend~ your anti-war rally. PIIIL A. ROBINSON, '71 WILLIAM M. WICKER, '71 Tl1rust Dear iJ\IIessrs.Robinson and Wiclter: I am encouraged to discover that you say that there is \no enterprise as worthy as a dem- onstJ.'\ation of concern over the major problems of the day\ and that there is \no lower form of irresponsibility than apathy.\ Now that we agree on funda- mentals we shou:d be able to deal with one another. 1) !I()w can you honestly be· lieve that there is only one opin· ion in regard to the race crisis in Arnel'ica, as you so state. To imply that Stokely Carmichael agrees with Roy Wilkins is showing yourself to be very ig- norant about matters concern- ing the Black man. To imply that either of them agrees with Mayor Daly of Chicago is equal· ly mistaken. Each of these men command respectable followings so I suggest you review your concepts of the crisis with which we are confronted. A large part of the problem is in fact this diversity <lf ipinion. We will be concentrating on this problem from 3-430 if you are interested in further exploring this matter. 2) St11dents like yourself are free to ask questions and com- ment .after hearing each speak- er. At least 20 minutes of quest- i<lns and comments will be en- tertained by each gentleman speaking. That leaves 1 hour and 20 minutes for self expres· sion. You owe it to yourself to attend. 3) I am not the person re· sponsi:b!e for deciding the set date. As I noted in the letter you refer to, this is a nation· wide day for expressing con- cern. The fact that this is the eve of Senior weekend is pure- ly coincidence. 4) I rr.ight add that Pre~i~~nt Martin supports the actlvitles p!anned for April 26. He has al· loted the Action Committee a udget for its planning. I am not calling off classes. Concerned facu~ty memebrs are. Please don't overstate my power. I am sorry that you do not plan to participate in the day's activities, but there are many of us who for reasons of consci- ence fee'l compelled: to attend.

What is the choice Nixon claims to offer? -more war? As far as Choice '68 and con· formity to a candidate such as Eugene McCarthy, the reason is clear. McCarthy offers hope with constructive proposals to- ward bringing an end to the fighting and working toward im· proving the situations in the ghettos.

Along what lines do we go about reforming the University, and ~ . with what ultimate goals in mind? First of aH, a basic demo· cratization of the university is needed. It is rather naive to 'i expect tht students who are educated and mature in a au- thoritarian society which does · little to really encourage the } growth of a sense of democratic i · · efficacy in the student, to be effe~bve, a c t i v e citizens in a democratic society.

Democratization of the Uni· versity is needed in order to serve the needs of the students. In order to serve these needs, you must know student needs and few administrations today really do. The issue is not that students alone should run the University. They should not. The issue is that the Administra- tion or a Board of Trustees (who are removed from the mainstream of modern education and rarely appear on campus) should not alone run the Uni· versity. Rather it should be a part student, faculty, adminis- tration effort, much less one- sided than it is at present. someday them- J ely to 'or- dealing •: • important and racial reason to .

What then is the purpose of University reiorm? !t is both to prepare the student to reform the larger society of which the University is a part and also to begin re.torming that society by ·retormmg the institution that produces the men on which the society depends f o r survival (The University). The modern University is at once the rertectian of sac1ety and the vanguard of society. In or- der to reform society, we must reform the University. It is not easy tc reform a Umversity be· cause it supports the status-quo and thus enjoys reciprocal sup- port from all those opposed to reform, Yet, when one consid- ers tl:te effect that the Univer- sity has on society, it is obvious that reform must begin with the UDiversity. Men First At the same time, it is ir, responsible to speak of reform as some vague abstraction. The universities today have failed to produce men who think and act as whole men. They go through the university, .complete their assignments and come out stamped \engineers\, \doctors\ \scien:tists\ or \economists.'' There is no course that leadS! to a degree labe~ling one as a \human\. The university today must teach students to think cf themselves first of all as \men\. Then, they will have to see how inchurnan is their society and quietly go about changing ;it. This is the real challenge to the university today. Will it be the vanga~rd of a new society? L.

But because there was so little student unrest, the derms were built.\ This is another instance of \where the Student Council could have taken and should in the future take a strong stand with the support of the student body.\ Intellectualism \The white society must give massive aid to the society of the Negro. Union must go out and recruit Negro students and eventually have a student body here which is twenty per cent Negro.\ Only through recruiting of gifted students, both black and white and the cultivation of a more intellectual atmos- phere at Union, through higher salaries to attract better pro· fessors, can Union become the first-rate school it should be.\ Recruiting is useless, however, unless there is a basic change in the attitude of the student body. They must \carry intellec- tualism out of the classroom and into the outside.\ A change in the students, brought about by such things as the student strike. Campus Action Commit· tee and the Black Student Alli· ance will do more to attract the intellectual, concerned stu- dent than any other single ef- fort. \An increased aura of in- tellectualism will in time bring a higher calibre of students in I a r g e r numbers, and Union's reputation as a college w i 11 benefit.\ Blechner's motion also recom- mends that Union re-examine its role with regard to Black Amer· icans, in particular concernmg admissions, fraternity discrim- ination, the inclusion of African Studies and Negro Cultu1•e in the curriculum, a symposium on Negro art, as well as for· malized consultations with other area colleges and universities to learn what they are doing with regard to furthering racial jus- tice. The Harvard Crimson report- ed last week that institution was forced to severely curtail its offerings in African Studies because of limited departmental resources. Assistant Professors David Potts and Malcolm Wilson are currently giving an in-service course on Negro history and cul- ture to 1ocal school teachers, under the auspices of the Sche- nectady County Board of Edu- cation. A few Council members ques- tioned what right anyone had to inquire into the private af- fairs of the fraternities. It was also suggested that the Black Alliance did not want any help from the white community at Union. Bob Michaels pointed out that State and Federal laws, as well as College policy, forbids discrimination by fraternities in- sofar as they are housing units as well as social organizations and as such are bound by open- housing laws. Blechner said that not only were the leaders of the Black Alliance aware of and in favor of his motion but also that it was the responsibility of the College to begin to make sig- nificant contributions in this area, irrelevant of the goals and aspirations of the leaders of any ·.me proposed Club Sports Board constltutwn, drafted by Dean Olton, established a board to \recerve funds from the Ad· ministratron of the College and the btudent Tax Committee; to distribute these funds among the applicant athletrc clubs; to oversee and review the finan· cial, athletic and administrative procedures of the clubs.\ The Council concerned itself with the question of the mem· bershlp of the proposed Board, specifically with regard to the student members, i.e. whether or not they should he club sportsmen, as proposed in Dean Olton's draft. Craig Youner, who will be the Chairman of the Tax Committee next year, sug- gested that the junior and sen· ior members not necessarily be involved in club sports. Sports Editor Gary Prevost expresses some of his opinions of the proposed Club Sports Board and directs himself to the questions raised in the Student Council debate on page 4. The o t h e r Board members would be the President of the Delphics, who would be the chairman, the College Comp- troller, the Student Tax Com- mittee Chairman, and a member of the Physical Education fac- ulty, all ex-officio. In other business, the Council tabled until its next meeting a proposal for the financing of Club Sports and heard the pre- liminary report of a committee chaired by Stuart Shapiro that is proposing revisions in the Col- lege's calendar so that it will conform more closely to those of institutions that do not oper· ate on the three-three plan.

The 1968 varsity season begins tomornJw at 2:00 as the Garnet faces Hamilton Coltege. The frosh opea their season against the Northwood School here on Saturday afternoon. The match, originalily scheduled to be play- ed at Northwood, has been shift- ed to the Union courts. Kurzivs First fighting it out for the sixth sin- gles spet. Duckworth and the sixth singles player will be the third doubles team. On the frosh side 1 John La- roesch will play first singles, with Al Meisel at second sin- gles. Jack Liu will be third, Ray Ahearn fourth, and Scott Sanders fifth singles. Bill Co- lucci has the inside track for sixth singles. The fresh wiH pair up in order to fill the three doubles squads. The varsity will be looking to improve on a 4-6 record posted by last year's squad. Rochester Tops Trackmen 79-61 By HENRY FEIN A lack of sufficient manpower once again spelled defeat for the Garnet track team, as it lost its second meet in as many ~5tarts. The squad dropped a 79- 61 decision at the University of Rochester Saturday. The frosh evened their record at 1-1 with a 73-70 victory over the junior Ye llowj ackets. Once again, the Dutchmen did quite well in the sprints .and middle distances. Pete Ericson and' Dave Gray finished second and third in the 100. Ar Sessoms easily won both the 220 and 440 in 23.0 and 50.1, respectively, over the slow Rochester track. Carl Thurn took the ~80 in 1:59.4. The Yellowjackets, however, picked up valuable points in sweeping the mile and t1vo-mile runs, as well as the Jl()]e vault and shot put. Mike 1\~iehalski taok second in the high ,hurdles for the Garnet, while E~n Me- A voy and Art McCabe .teamed to finish second and thii:-d in the 440 hurdles. Jeff Kurzius wHl lead the var- sity at first singles. Teamed with him for the first doubles squad is senior Brad Wheatley.

Competing in the West Point Regatta the club fin- ished fourth out of a strong seven team field. Another group of seamen placed first in a five team field at New York Mari· time. With Bob Gill and John Gros- si competing in one boat and Dave Jillson and John Dallin in another, the Garnet compiled 60 points to trail the University of Pennsylvania (82), King's Point (69), and West Point (63). Trail- ing Union were Monmouth, Le- high, and Albany State. The seamen competed in six races with fourteen foot boats equipped with both jib and mainsail. Eill Pattison, Jeff Fitter, and Paul Fox competed in the scrim- mage at New York Maritime where the Garnet finished ahead of King's Point, Fordham, and New York Maritime, sailing in 30-foot sloops in the Shields' Class. By GRAY PREVOST A club sports charter was in· traduced in the student council last night which provides an ef- fective solution to the continu- ing problem. The charter em- bodies most of the provisions which were mentioned in this column two weeks ago-funding by Tax Committee and Adminis- tration, setting up of Club Sports Board and freedom from the Athletic Department. However, the makeup of the Club Sports Board has been changed from its original conception to in- clude the President of the Del- phics, the college comptroller, the Chairman of the Tax Com- mittee, a member of the Physi- cal Education faculty, and two representatives of club sports. The board as it stands forms a good balance; however, in stu- dent council debate last night it was argued by some council members before the charter was tabled, that club sports repre- sentatives should be excluded from the board because they would be biased toward their own club sport. Such an exclusion would defi- nitely be a step in the wrong direction because only persons POLITICAL ADVERTISING Students for McCarthy On Wednesday, April24, 1968 Students across the nation will rl:::-..ke history by indicating their choice for President, in Choice '68 We urge Union students to vote for Eugene McCarthy as the best qualified man for this cffice. On November 30, 1967, a quiet courageous senator fror.1 Minnesota suddenly gave new hope to millions of :::.~m:ious desperate voters. Senator Eugene McCarthy u..11d:=:ctook what was termed the \impossible.\ He chal- le;.:32d P1esident Johnson for the Democratic nornina- tio:1 .:.:x F:.:esident in 1968. He made no bones about the reason: t!:e war in Vietnam. Rece:'lt events have vindicated his stand as well as proving his ability to win. On Lprilll in Boston Senator McCarthy proposed that the Federal Government \determine a minimum income which it will insure for all Americans.\ He spoke of right for all men to a decent job and income, to adequate health care, to a decent education which \7ill develop man's full potential, and to a decent home in a community with space and facilities to enable peo- ple to develop as full human beings. We urge all students to vote for the cool, composed courageous Senator from Minnesota.

It would defi. nitely be possible to choose two persons involved with club sports who could put the inter- ests of the whole program above that of their own sport. To exclude club sport repre- sentatives would continue the present undesirable situation wherein the major decisions concerning club sports have been made without consultation with the persons most directly involved. For example, the Tax Committee cut off funds to the club sports last fall without dis- cussing the problem with them, and the club sport charter was drawn up and introduced in the council without even any noti- fication to club sport represent- atives. Therefore, I urge the Student Council to pass the charter as it stands to give the club sports the representation that they de- serve. Sr ..

John Duffy, a Union sophomore, has been chosen as the St. Andrews Exchange Student for the com i n g school year. Started in 1937, the St. Andrews Exchange is a reciprocal exchange program involving students and pro- fessors from Union and St. Andrews. St. Andrews, located in Edinburgh, is Scotland's oldest university. The St. Andrews Committee, com- posed of administrators, faculty, and the most recently past exchange stu- dent (Kent Kraft) chose Duffy from approximately twenty sophomores who SUNY Girl Molested In West College Field A 19-year-old girl from the State University of New York at Albany was raped and beaten in the field in front of West College on Tuesday at 10:30 P.M. According to reports given to Acting Dean of Students Charles Olton by Schenectady police, the girl, who had come to Union to visit her boyfriend, was walking down Seward Place toward South Avenue when she saw a man by a motorbike. Because it was dark, she did not want to go any further. She then walked up Union Street and onto the campus at the Presi- dent's house. Not being able to find her boyfriend, the girl looked around the parking lot for his car, which she could not locate either. As she was going up the steps in front of North College the girl was grabbed from behind, beaten, and raped. Her assailant, the girl told authorities, had followed her for a short time before attacking her. Fi- nally the girl managed to cry out and he let her go. Hysterical, she then ran to Richmond House where stu- dents called the police. were invited to apply for the program, said Dean C. W. Huntley, who heads the Committee. Eight of these twenty students de- cided to compete for this honor; each was then thoroughly interviewed by the St. Andrews Committee. Dean H1mtley feels that scholarship, lead- ership, activities, and perceptiveness are important characteristics to be considered, but he added that the student's overall achievements and character were most important. On the basis of the above criteria, Duffy was selected from the eight competitors. Besides maintaining a high academic index, Duffy played freshman lacrosse and was a member of both the freshman and varsity football teams; also, he is the treas- urere of Chi Psi. Duffy, a history major is concentrating on Russian history and minoring in Russian. One of the questions Duffy was asked during his interview concerned Union's relation to the racial prob- lems in the United States. Duffy feels Union must become more progressive, not only by admitting more Negro students, but also by making the stu- dent body more sharply aware of the problems they must face. 3 l The focus of the campaign is that Jackowski presents a radical image _-. - with regard to Semerad, an Establish- -- ment man. LOCKWOOD HELD TRINITY CAPTIVE The girl gave the police a descrip- tion of her assailant and said she can identify him. The police have the hat and gloves which the man left behind and a suspect for whom they are searching. The girl is quite. sure from his talk and dress that the man attacked her was not a college stu- dent. He believes that one's college edu- cation should include an exposure to the realities that white middle-class Americans would sooner ignore. Con- tinuing Duffy said he considered fra- ternities to be anachronisms which serve only to accentuate differences among students. He said that fratern- ities are not broad enough in action or ideals. Besides continuing his history stud- ies next year at St. Andrews, Duffy hopes to travel in Ireland and Eng land - especially London - but he may have the opportunity to tour the Continent. 3 61 71 Pet.

The strike, which virtually paralyzed the college, was organized chiefly by Terry L. Jones, a senior at Trinity and presi- Tickets On Sale Tickets for Saturday night's con- cert featuring Flip Wilson and Wilson Pickett will be sold in the Rathskeller tonight and in Mem- orial Field House priot\ to the 8:30 p.m. performance. All students are requested to enter the door at the Northwest corner between 7:30 and 8 p.m. dent of the Trinity Association of Negroes, which includes the 20 or so non-whites on the campus. Students brought mattresses, radios, hamburg- ers, and textbooks to the building, and were prepared, according to Jones, to stay until their demands were met. $75,000 Demand The students were demanding that the college immediately commit $75,~ 000 to a new scholarship fund for Negroes, giving preference to high school students from Hartford and New Haven. The other $75,000 in the plan would come from a college fund now used for such student activities as the stu- dent center and campus publications and student work projects. The stu- dents are also demanding courses in such fields as Negro history and the psychology of the ghetto. Dr. Albert Jacobs, college presi- dent, called the sit-in \intimidation\ and said that the trustees had been giving their favorable consideration in that direction until the demonstra- tion started. Phi Delt Out For Blood The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity and the Schenectady C()unty Chapter of the American Red Cross will co- sponsor a campus blood drive in Alumni Gymnasium early next week. Blood donations will he accepted from 9 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. Monday and from 11 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. on Tuesday. The two-day drive will be an attempt to replenish the dwindling supply presently available to area residents and students. Robert Michaels, a ·senior at Phi Delta Theta and chairman of the campus blood drive said he hopes Union students will enthusiastically respond to the desperate need for blood in the Schenectady area and reverse the embarrassingly poor turn- out recorded for the blood drive of last fall. Publicized Members of Phi Delta Theta have publicized the blood drive in each fraternity house and each floor of the college residence balls. A fra- ternity member spoke directly to the members of each living unit, provid- ing detailed information regarding the drive and emphasizing the need for individual response. Permission slips for students under 21 years of age have been sent to parents. Those who obtained permis- sion to donate blood last fall need not secure parental permission to donate again. Those who wish to donate blood but have not received permission slips from their parents may obtain such form from Bob Michaels or any mem- ber of the Phi Delta Theta. Free Keg As an incentive to group participa- tion, the Brothers of Phi Delta Theta are offering a keg of beer to the fra- ternity house or living unit which yields the highest percentage of do- nators during the two-day campaign. Any student who has not been con- tacted by a member of Phi Delta Theta or who has any questions re- garding the blood drive are requested to call the Phi Delta Theta fraternity house at 346-9730 or Bob Michaels at 346-9848. Faculty Hears Ideas On Helping Poor Students· The general faculty yesterday aft- ernoon heard college officials discus- sing ramifications of a college com- mitment to help the disadvantaged student. R. Gordon Bingham, Director of Student Aid explained that such a commitment by the college would re- quire a large amount of extra money which might easily prove hard to find. Bingham said that at present, to appropriate extra scholarships for disadvantaged students would mean cutting funds to other students. Draft Foul Calvin Schmidt, Registrar, pointed out that disadvantaged students might be carrying a lighter load so that they might run afoul .of draft law re- quirements which state that a student must carry a full time load. The problems confronting the Com- mittee on standing were explained by C. W. Huntley, Dean of Faculty. He said that the committee would have to develop \more flexible policies\ and different rules and counseling. Jonathan Pearson, III, Director of Admissions, explained the implica- tions of this policy for admissions. About 100 faculty members were present at the meeting.
