Mrs. Hoadley also announced that the time o.f the concert had been moved from 8:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. because of transportation difficul- ties. Student tickets are priced at 75 cents each and are available at the bookstore. Students who are interested in serving as ushers for the concert should see Sidney Smith at the college library. Outstanding Voi<'l\ Miss Maynor, who, in spite of her youth has already earned the title of \The Outstanding Voice of the Day\ has been on tour all over the United States during the past four years. She has sung with the Phila- deJ,phia Symphony ·Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. She sings in English, French, and Ger- man with equal facility. A deep interest in helping her own people is characteristic of Miss Maynor. She is a serious student of music and her constant desire is to be worthy to sing the best music. Born in Norfolk, Virginia, the daughter of a Methodist minister, Miss Maynor is very fond of sports and outdoor life.

Other mem'bers of the student body are being con- tacted this week to make sure that all have an opportunity to give blood. The audience at the opening of the drive heard Lieutenant Wil- lam A. Mahaney, one of the Navy doctors on duty at the Schenectady Blood Donor center, describe the benefits and the procedure of the national drive. Nl\ed Parents' Consent Students under 21 years of age who said they were willing to give blood are being given parents' con- sent blanks ·by members of the col- lege donation committee. These 'blanks must be signed •before the Red Cross will accept a donation from these men. Mr. Herbert R. Houghton, chair- man of the committee, announcing the number of men willing to mak0 donations, if they are physically able, said that 63 fraternity men, 17 dormitory residents, and 15 com· muters had eigned the cards dis· tributed in the assembly program. All members of the library staff have already donated blood at least once, and one of the staff has made two donations, according to a letter recei¥ed .by Mr. Houghton from Gertrude Antemann, of the library staff. ·Other members of the faculty and staff of the college have already contributed, as have several stud- ents. ---0---- Miss Grace Mills to Direct Mountebanks Production night on Saturday, February 20th.

Recalling with nosta:lg·ia the halcyon da~·s of our youth, when <tnything seemed pos- sible, we thought remiuiscently of attempts made then to co-ordinate the pesky ques- tionings so that the torture might be spread evenly over a reasonable length of time, al- lowing for incense-buming and the slaugh- tering of fatted calves befo.re an academic altar. Trotting along impudently in the footsteps of the mightr, we were told then that the \vhole affai1· had ah·eady been ar- ranged; the Academic Minds served notice on a sort of 0. P. A. of theil· intent to in- quire, and were straightway informed of a convenient date. chance fo1· too Naturally. Naturally, there was no many tests on one day. The trifling consideration that the ar- rangement was totally ignored bothered no one. So, like all good children we assigned the rule to the Eliphalet Nott blue law per- iod and went back to sleep. This \Veek, we were saying, the three~ headed serpent has lifted its tickling fangs.

Such thoughts went out of fashion, for us, along with the passing of the symposium. Really, no\v, let's not meddle. It was just a passing thought. The serpent remains in- vulnel'able while Janus gum·ds the door. PROVING THE RIGl-iT TO LIVE The \\'a1· Congress of American Industry passed in December a l'esolution expressing the opinions of business leaders on the st<tt- us of the small college in the present war. The l'esolution, pointing out the difficulties under which small colleges must work and calling them \a vital part of the nation's educational system,\ goes on to urge that the federal govel'nment use as many small colleges as possible for training centers and \by revisions in the tax laws and other con- structive measures aid m the survival of such colleges.\ There is, of course, reason for fem· b\· the colleges of direct subsidies which might eventually cost an institution like Union its independence. But if the government can be persuaded to purchase from the colleges that sort of service which they are best able to give, the training of young men now or after the war, the college might safely feel that it was justifying its existence which be- ing helped to continue. Loans to the colleges, to be re-paid with the training· of soldie1·s af- ter the war, are quite feasible. In any case, the small colleges deserve the opportunity to prove that they can exist not through charity, but through the sel'Vice they can render. UNTURNED STONES Houghton.

Barry paced the scoring with 23 markers while Ciampa with 11; Perkins, 10; He!n, 10; and Lawrence, 10 led the winning five. FoHowing their triumph over the Fijis the coaches romped to an easy 65-28 victory over a bewildered and slightly bedraggled Phi Delt team. Coaches Stay on Top The coaches scored in the open- ing minute of play and never were headed. Changing from their usual rough and tumble style of ball, they occasionally executed some fancy maneuvers which might be clae- sified under the general heading of play-making. They led H-eight and 28-10 at the ends of the first two stanzas. They ran the score to 42-18 at the end of the third period and loafed to a 65-28 conquest. Jess Perkins and Ralph Semerad, with 18 and 16 points, respectively, paced the coaches. They were fol- lowed by Mel Hein, with 14; Joe Stafford of the losers with 12; and Al Ciampa with 10 counters. High-scoring honors for the week went to Meehan and Quigley of the Betas who .paced their team with 16 points apiece. Hamilton's 15 for North Co)lege; Guare's 12 for the Theta 'Delta ·Chis; Dallon's 11 for the Chi Psis ;and Taylor'\ nine for the Sigs were other high totals for the week.

Present plans envision federal subsidies for edu- cation of 'both young men and women fm important civHian war jobs. However, a new plan--which pio- vides no subsidies to students is being submitted to the Commission by educators here. The plan repre- sents a minority view which con- tends that it will be impossible to get adequate funds-and get them quickly enough..,from Congress.

He added that such informa- tion was also required in the case of selective service men who may apply for candidate officer training. The complete text of the an- nouncement, as made on Tuesday, is as follows: ''The Army and Navy desire information on the habit of punctuality with respect to their Reservists, Information of this kind i.s also required in the case of those selective service men who may apply for candi- date officer training.

Until that time, no details of the prospective unit will be available. President's Stati>ment The selection committee was com- posed of three men each from the War Department, the Navy Depart- ment, and the War Manpower Com- mission. The list, which included 281 institutions, was only a partial one and will be expanded as further selections are made. President Fox's statement con- cerning Sunday's announcement is as follows·: \InJerence may have ·been drawn from Sunday's newspaper an- nouncement that Union College has been designated as a .place for Naval Engineering Training. We have been informed only that this college has been designated for in- spection \by a Naval Board on March 15. The action of the Navy Department based upon the ·report of this board will determine the final designation, or not, of the college. We are not as yet informed as to what the length or content of the course would be, or when it will begin.\ Hamilton Trains Airmen The Navy will consider 46 other colleges for engineering training, along with Union. Others in this group from New York .State include Columbia, Cornell, R. P. I., Roches- ter, and Webb Institute. Hamilton, Vermont and Albany State Teachers' College will be con- sidered 'bY the War Department for the training of Aviation Cadets. The War Department will inspect Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute as a possible school for training engi- neers. Council Chooses Informal Dances Prom Weekend Members of the Interfraternity Council voted in favor of informal house dances for the second night of Junior Prom Week-end, March 5 and 6, and considered plans for the annual Sub-Freshman Weekend at its meeting on Monday night. The action represented the final success of a movement which was attempted without success before several of the recent formal week- ends. In each previous case opinion has been so nearly equally divided that each house was given the right to exercise its own option. On all of these previous occasions most of the houses favoring informal dances ·have eventually given in to those favoring formal affairs on both nights of the weekend. At this week's meeting, however, The Philomatheans will debate a a large majority of the member visiting Colgate team tomorrow groups voted for informal dances. evening at 7:30 p. m. on the topic During the discussion ·on Sub- \Post-War Planning on the Basis Freshman Week-end, a tentative of the Four Freedoms\.

The program will feature the following films: \Listen to Britain\ \Western Front\ and \U. S. News Review No, 1.\ All the films have been re- leased by the United States Office of War Information and have been ·equipped with sound. The problem of entertaining guests .for Junior Prom weekend and Sub-freshman weekend in view of the point rationing system to start March 1 was discussed with- out action. PRE-MED TESTS Because of the large number of students taking the Medical Apti- tude Test on Friday, February 12, at 3 P. M., it will be held in the lecture room of the Electrical En- gineering laboratory and not in the Civil engineering building as pre- viously announced. C. F. Garis Dean

Professors in the science and engineer- ing divisions usually insist they have no ab- sence problem; cuts are too costly to be taken too frequently. Othe1· instructors still find gaping holes in their clas:;;rooms, however. and this week a determined step was taken to scare the students into class. \The absence reco1·d for this term \\'ill be written on the academic tre:u1scl'ipt of ever~­ student\ the president said in Daily Assem- bly on Tuesday. These academic transcripts \Yill be supplied to the services fo1· reserns and made available to men called under the terms of selective sen·ice_ v\'e suppose this will be effective, after a fashion, because most l'nion men hope some- day to be office1·s. But the end hard!~· seems to justify the means. :\'either the president ol' m1~·l)Ody else has said that the serv!ces specifically requested that the absence record be included on the academic tnmscripts. \\'hen asked last night whether the services had demanded thei1· reserves' absence rec- ords, Dr. Fox referred to his Daily Assembly announcement, which is quoted in full on the first page of this issue. vYe can only conclude that no such specific request has been received. Instead, it seems that the aven1ge student's desi1·e for ad- vancement once he is in uniform is being capitalized upon fm· the sake of a problem in any other· way. Obviously, the purpose of the move is a good one. Cndue absences can no more be tolerated now than they should have been in the past. But this hardly seeH1S the way to go about assuring attendance. Threatening the disfm·o1· cf the armed services does not :::-olve a purely local problem. If the ;,;e1·vices have, Ol' should in the fu- tme, ask for this information, naturall~· it should be supplied.

Student members of the student faculty conference committee were consulted on the problem of absences last Friday. Approach- ing the problem with little advance warning, they could offer no concrete suggestions. No one mentioned to them the procedure later adopted. Once again student participation in the administration of student affairs has been ignored. The real answe1· to the problem lies in the absence of minor punishments at Union. The only step beyond a lecture from the dean now antilable is expulsion. \\'hen the administra- tion decides to set up intermediate forms of discipline, such as debarment from extra- curricular activities, automatic reductions in grades, or inc1·eased attendance at daily or Sunday chapel. the solution of not only this, Lut other disciplinary problems here will have taken a step forward. Hepo1 ting absences to the services may get e-.eryone except the fom·-F's around to classes, but the problem will remain, and the p1oduction of loyal alumni will not be ad- vanced. Yes, sil·. We'll go to class. Nous sommes tous fi·eres sous les lois de Ia guerre.

Some day I From Johnny Baas, now a Corporal in England (dated Jan_ 21st.): \Last week I celebrated my half year anniversary in the Army and five months of that half year have been spent over-seas. Never got much of a chance to see what army life back in the states was like, for before I knew it, I was on a boat that finally dropped me 'somewhere in the British Isles' . . . right now I am in England, and of all the places over here that I have been, I like this the best. On an occa- sional day off duty, I have been able to do a little traveling to near- -by places of historical inte1·est and see some of the wu1 thwhile sights. The trouble is, every day that I've had off it has been raining, but then, it rains almost every day any- way so it didn't matter very much. Speaking generally, as we are forced to in our correspondence, it is a very damp climate and it took me some time to get used to it. Matter of fact, it caused a touch of bronchial pneumonia which put me in the hospital for a while. But now that I am used to it, the weather doesn't -bother me. A t·ecent trip took me to the historic old city of Bath. There I saw the remains of the ancient Roman hot-spring baths that were an amazing exa-mple of ancient architecture. In spite of the 2000 years that have elapsed since their construction, they re- main in remarka:bly good condition, and the hot springs still pour forth hope to come back here as a civil- attendants, Fabian and Feste.

I am currently ensconsed in the ad- vanced Air Force Navigation School here, teaching the mysteries of dead reckoning and the Ptolemaic astronomical universe to a class of 40 cadets.

At that time the other principal group was the Adelphic Society which had been founded in 1797. The two organizations wer·e equal-ly pl·omi- nent from a literary point of view and were fierce rivals fot· domin- ance on the campus.

Members of the faculty were honorary members of all societies and frequently atten.d- ed the debates. After the Civil War the society suffered a derlim. Although it continued to be active during every year, there seemed to be a lack of interest among the stu- dnets in general. One act sPems to corroborate this. In 1843 on their fiftieth anniversary the Philoma- theans held a great celebration with speeches and poems. Presi- dent Andrew Van Vranken Ray- mond's \History of Union College\ written in 1907, mentions this event in some detail. There is howe•·er no mention of a similar celebra- tion in 1893.

The president's statement ans\\·er- ed the most pressing question raised: the in- formation was requested of the college by the services, verbally, even though not in writing. Whether or not this ruling effectively re- duces cuts, the problem has not been per- manently solved. This al'l'nngement can be effective only while there are a large group of reservists anticipating call among the stu- dent body. Since the question has come up, this seems as good a time as any to search out a lasting answer, one that relates directly to the problem at hand. One possible solution to the problem was worked out during the summer session last year. Under this proposal, each student would be allowed a fixed number of absences per course. For each alJsence above that num- ber, a certain number of tenths of a point would be 1·emoved from his index at the end of the mal'li:ing period. He would retain the same marks, and the reduced index would Bt~\'.jnp~~ ~t-af,f llaY.d L·'tatzl'l·, )Larvill Ei~L·lllit·rg, .AlJ- laott \'l..\t'.'H~IPill lishment of Union as a center for ----~------~, the giving of the Graduate Coun- cil Examination.

There seems to be some slight confusion among the members of the lowe1· classes over the traditional use of paint as a means of demonstntting the virility and artistic talents of a class at Cnion. The idea, gentlemen, is to put the paint cln the Idol, not on the n>.:<t of the campus. Painting the Idol and fighting- over the privilege of doing so are among the inalien- able rights of eve1·y L'nion man, along vvith deprecating Skidmore and complaining about the Schenectad~· climate. But the doors of buildings, the smoke-stack, and similar prom- inent features of the campus are not intend- ed for advertising purposes. Everyone was so mew hat disconcerted a few years ago when some artists, allegedly from R. P. I., treated the porous limestone of Payne Gate to a dose of quick-drying red enamel. which cost mo1·e than a thousand rlollai :< to lt'lllO\\l'.

ORCHIDS FOR ENGINEERS A little belatedly, we should like to con- gratulate the membe1·s of the student chap- ters of the American Societ;v of CivH Engi- neers and American Institute of Electrical Engineers who have recentl~· published Vol- ume One, :t\ umber One of a newspaper b;y, for, and about the engineering division he1·e. J.Iess1·s. Loeb and Jankowski and their assis- tants have created a lively, interesting \house organ'' for their division which should continue. o1· the friendly jibes of students in other divisions, the engineering courses create among their students a unity and an espdt de corps almost entirely lacking in other divisions. Perhaps it is the A.S.C.E. and the A.I.E.E. that deserve credit for this. In any case, viewing it from the outside, the spirit looks healthy to us. It must have been largely this feeling that made their newspaper possible and as far as we can see, only good can come of it. Oul' self-styled \intellectuals\ might do well to look into this feeling. Perhaps our engineers can build something subtler tlum bridges.

It is the sort of evidence most useful in establishing one's standing upon re- turn to academic study. The Graduate Record Examina- tion results are also used by many other agencies: by leading gradu- ate schools when students seek admission, by Federal services in estimating qualifications of appli- cants. and by colleges accepting distinguished scores as evidence that a student has met the college standard for a degree even though his course requirements should- be incomplete. Here March 16, 17 The Graduate Record Examina- tion will be held at Union College in two successive sessions on the afternoons of March 16th and 17th from 1 to 5 P. M. in Room 22 of the Electrical Engineering Build- ing. About three hours of actual working time are taken in each session. Students interested in the Ex- amination should make application immediately to Professor Harold Blodgett, Examiner- in -Charge. Since the list of applicants must be closed two weeks prior to the time of taking the tests, these ap- plications should .be made not later than March 2. Professor Blodgett will be glad to give full informa- tion concerning the Examination to any student, and to give him a \Descriptive Prospectus for Col- lege Students\ which describes the Examination in detail. Every Union College student is eligible for the Examination on a voluntary basis. A fee of $3.00 is requii·ed for the Test, an amount which but partially covers the cost of its administration. The result of the Examination, it is repeated, is entirely confidential and sub- mitted directly to the student. The Graduate Record Office will for- ward a duplicate of the record to any interested institution or offi- cial upon the request of the stu- , dent. spring.

Known as a universal indexing trun- mon fixture, the device permits quick moving of the casings for drilling at any angle in a full circle and on any plane. :V1ovement is controlled by a push- burton. A bout 110 holes must be drilled and ~arped in each of the casings. Formerly 1t took a crane tO move the casings (which vary in weight from 1000 to 2000 !b) after each surface was drilled and evet-y piece of work had to be se~ up at least six times. Now work is set up just once--on a table t~at can be turned completely around 1n either direction with no more effort than it takes to push a revolving door-and, amazinglv enough, 24 to 32 hours a week are saved. TH£ BETTER TO SEE WITH P ARTICLES as small as one millionth of an inch-one thousandth of the diameter of a human hair-can be clearly seen with the new G-E electron microscope. Developed by Drs. C. H. Bachman (Iowa State, '32) and Simon Ramo (U. of Utah, '33), the new instrument can magnify a specimen as much as 10,000 times and reveal the actual com- position and structure of such minute things as dust and smoke particles. Here's how it works: a beam of elec- trons inside a vacuum chamber passes through the specimen, passes through an \elec~ron lens,\ and produces a magni- fied plcture on a fluorescent view screen. This image can then be photographed outside the tube and enlarged up to 100,000 times the original specimen. The microscope, designed for use in small laboratories and war plants, is portable and operates on ordinary house current. General Electric Company, Schenecrad y, N. Y.

It was also announc- ed that the time and place of the drawings for the f.ratemity booths would be communicated to the houses later this week. Member:;, o! the Civilian PHot Training course and all other men in uniform wiU be ad'mitted to the dance upon payment of the 30-cent tax on an admissions, Paul Myers '44, chairman, sa·id yesterday. Mycr·s said that he had completed ar- rangements with Lieutenant John- son, who commands the CPT con- tingent, so that the trainees will be able to attend. In view or the fact that the tickets were not available for sale until today, Myers announced yes- terday that the price would -remain at $3.30 until Thursday of next week. At that time, the tickets will advance in price to $4.40. The fee for the fractemity booths will remain, as in the past, at $15. Sherwood Grei·ner '44, who is in charge of the arrangement of the booths, said that he would not be able to complete plans until definite arrangements had 'been made for the decorations. However, he ex- pected to be able to hold the draw- ings within a day or two. He em- phasized that fraternity represen- tatives will have to present the checks for their booths at the time ·of the drawing in order tto take part. Defense Stamp Corsa~;\eS The deciston 'i.O allow only the patriotic defense-stamp corsages first designed and used at the In- ter-fraternity Bail was made in keeping with the theme of the dance, \A Salute to the United' Na- tions.\ The corsages will consist of four 25-cent defense stamps mount- ed with a flower and will be on sale at the dance for $1.50. The decorations will also be in keeping with the \United Nations\ theme, although no details would be announced by the committee. Attractive souvenir-favors have al- ready been ordered for each couple· attending the dance. However, in keeping with Prom and Interfra- ternity Ball tradition, the exact de- scription of the favors will remain a secret until the night of the dance. Myers said yesterday that the prospects of a broadcast from the dance were contingent upon per- mission from the band's manage- ment, since it is possible that Enoch Light's orchestra, which will pro- vide the music fot the affair, might have other .broadcast committments which would interfere. Members of the committee said that they had received glowing re- ports on the success of Enoch Light at his current engagements. Among the pictures of members of the band which have been received from the William Morris agency is the one of the orchestra's vocalist, which appears in this issue of The Concordiensis. ---a--- PROM VOCALIST C • ·t E d llJ( h 2 • Unveil Cornerstone ampa•gn o . n IYiarc ; f\ ,. u f U • C II Of ·s h'd A d Kappa Alpha Takes First JrST nome 0 n:ron ° • ege · c: Y ~a emy Place: Chi Psi's Are Second . · , At 148th Annaversary With .Jess tha:a one week before the end of the coHege War Stamp -Drive, the committee has been able to report total purchases of $923.45 0r a per capita average of $1.45 for the whole student body.

I was an instructor at J·acksonville for nearly 2 years- and have been in this Squadwn for 3 months.\ It would, perhaps, be pre1natl!lre to con- g-ratulate the Prom committee on the success of a dance which is a little n.1ore than a week in the future, but it is not too early to say that the work of this committee, thtts far, in the face of several difficulties, has been .prontisi ng-. Unfortunately few members of the student body have been members of a committee in charge of one of our inft·eqHent maj.or dances. Those who have can appreciate the problems this year's Junior Prorn committee has faced. It was not the wn1mittee itself that decided to lower the price of the dance from the customary six dollars to three. This decision, while it seems to us to have been a wisE! one, necessarily has made it difficult for the committee to plan as sumptuous an affair as has been Union's custom. In spite of this fact, advance indications seem to show that the dance win be equal in every respect to former pr()B1S. This has been made possible by the fortunate signing of Enoch Light's orchestra at a time when this band was available at a considerable saving to the committee. The whole problem of obtaining- an orches- tra f'or this dance \vas complicated by its unusually early date.

It certainly is not Lines in a Mud Pud cUe We have never held much agreement with the sentiments of i.\Ir. William Wordsworth and others o.f his trade who protested in metre the beauties of natm·e and the poetic qualities of an humble flowel'. We can take our hollyhocks or leave the1n alone, but we have a leaning toward the hay-fever-and- poison-ivr school as opposed to the small- celandine line of reasoning. Nevet·theless, there is something refresh- ing about a pe1·fect expanse of green lawn that someone else has to mow, and we rise to the defense of those ancient and honorable portions of the college campus which have not succumbed to the automobile, whose in- trusion, we presume, l\11~. Wordsworth wouldn't have liked, either. Therefore, gentlemen, with due pomp, may we exercise the immortal privilege of each Concordiensis editor; whose fancies, in the spring, ilwal\iably turn to the thought, \Keep off the grass while it is a sea of mud, else you'll have no lawn come summer.\ Hospitality at the Gymnasium A number of students have urged us vehe- mently to editorialize against the excessive numbe1· of local youths inhabiting the floor of the gymnasium regularly every afternoon. They point out with considerable justice that these members of the younger set succeed in monopolizing- the court and the basketball equipment at a time when they themselves would like to enjoy the gymnasium privi- leg-es they deserve. It is a little difficult to seem unhospitable toward these young men, but we can under- stand the annoyance of those who have com- plained and pass along- their sugg-eestion to those in charg-e. ' ... Mutabile Semper Femina' Now that the Freshman-Sophomore Dance has succeeded, we feel free to take certain members of its committee to task for an error which threatens to snuff the last g-lim- mer of lig-ht from the classic tradition in education. We don't particularly hanker for the days when every colleg-e man tossed off an Hoeatian ode as his man-servant served tea brewed on a wood-stove, but we are im- measurably saddened to think that even un- derclassmen, who by now must be reg-ret- fully aware that Union supports only male students, should refer on their posters to the building dedicated to our gTaduates as the \Alumnae\ Gymnasium.

As a matter of fact, it seems to me that the violent conservatism of the committee members graduaUy forces all new proposals made out of the picture. Though we all agreed at the start that things ex- isting are rotten, that something new and effective, something more streamlined and powerful should be found, we work step by step back to the existing constitution. All new ideas, after \thorough'' ex- amination, are .discarded. as too dangerous, too uncertain. For example: General represen- tation on the council, which would include all campus groups, present or future, regardless of theil:' pres- · ent affiliations or status, is dis- carded in favour of only limited representation. Thus, the Interfraternity Coun- cil, just because its president fights for the status quo of \his\ council and has most fraternity members on his side, must remain an inde- pendent body, entirely outside the Student Council. That such action impairs the efficiency of aony fu- ture Student Council <in unity lies the power> is ignored as rubbish. Thus, a provision for the inclu- sion of a neutral representative on the Council, when and if a truly \neutral organization\ might ap- pear in the future, is also discard- ed. So we are practically back where we started from. Such partisanship lacks any im- partiality or broader outlook, to say the least. And that is not all. '!'he lack of interest for the pro- Ject among the committee mem- bers is simply appalling. I cer- tainly cannot expect everybody else to be as interested in this work as I happen to be at the pres- · ent, but I would have thought that a few at least would be more sin- cere and take the business seri- ously. When most don't even show up for the meetings, or if they ap- pear don't pay attention to what's going on and mer•ely try to get out. of it as fast as possible, I can only say 'too bad for them', because, I am quite sure that the day will come when a general interest in student self-government will oust from their positions the passive and uninterested figureheads now at the top, to replace them with the kind of fellows who possess the guts to speak up and venture_ Dimi \COMPANY HALT.
