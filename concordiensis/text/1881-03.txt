McConnell , s~ We will not think to-night how near To twenty, thirty years lie slain Between each stately ''Senior Year\ Anc1 this brief hour, when, gathered here, We dream youth's drea1ns a,gain. Across their shadowed waste of cares A light from Union's walls is thrown- A light no storn1 of life im.pairs- And yet a softeneJ.light that wears A pathos all its own. We tread the terrace grasses lush When spTing-tid.e all our pulses thrills, And watch, at evenh1g'stender hush, The trailing sunset b~nners flush The gateway in the hilll:::l. We hear the bell~ half-n1nf£led peal When winter sno\YS lie thick and deep, And while we setJ the breath congeal We groan to think \Ve cannot steal Another hour t< > sleep. We hear the nwrry fi.<lclle ring, And merry footsteps beat the floor In old North College vacant wing And s~ile to seG 1nzttr: foot and Ntr ing When iVutt walks through thL~ door. Alas! these nre but n1emory's brides-· . We only c1imly drea1i1· aga,in . . . Of Y')uth's 1nad pranks and stingless glees-- A:nd wonder if the feathered tribes Boost now as lligh as th(Jn. And yet no ''wealth of I11d\ could buy These mem'l'ies of our youth-tide's flood, Though we recall it but to sigh That boys and girls have drifted by That '' hey -dey of the blood.'' Though 'vve may pass our full four-score, Not even then can be forgot That ever hospitable door- Or three-wheeled chaise that always bore The venerahle .J,.Yott. Who learned of hi1n the tasl{ achieved By starting from the very ground ; No half- way s1natter Wets received- \ Perception\ was at once \ perceived\ To be no empty souncl. Who held the lists of argument With him 1nust wield a trenchant blade ; Who viec1 in charities, was spent,- Who tried to cheat him, 'Jnight repent,- Scholars ean, suH1J~ti?nes, trade. Great hearted, catholic old man! rrhy mincl was rich in garnered truth; Thy soul with sympathy o'erran, Holding alike in loving span Gray age and waywar<l youth ! Now an enchanted garden's 1n:1ze Blooms feesh and sweet on 1nemory's track, And clown its pliant, winding \V::tys A sturdy little figure strays;- Ah! clear old \ Uaptain .!a<'k.\ Who says that H figures\ lllttke hearts cold.? \Ve better know, beeansG we knew The ver.y.ldng of \ figures \-hold A::; Bayard, yet a huuch'~·d-folu ::\fore tender, warm, n.ud true. Forgive us that we catch the gleam Of bright gilt buttons through the years, Thy cheri::;hed foihles only :-:;r:e'ln To nu.tk.e the substance of onr dream; \V e sm. ile to choke our tears. With Hel>rew texts our cftrs are filled, In Lewis'8 translations.given, Whose tr2nchant English sought to build A'surer faith, and always thr:illecl With lofty hope of heaven.
