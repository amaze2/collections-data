But since these m.otions or noises give only self- satis.fa.ction, we often seek expres- • sion through a medium w'hereby we may communicate to othet:s what we feel. A number of com- mon forms have arisen, therefore, and out of these ha·s grown what· we term 'art'. The perfection of this formalized expr.cssion, wheth- er it be in dance, or poetry, or • music. or theater, determinrs the degree of art present in the com- · plete works; and the balance of spirit or inspiration and form gives a basis for judgment. Standard of Judgment \If any .absolute va'lucs., any ap- preciation which men inexplicably · find within themselves, any univer- sal standard of judgme1it exists, it exists most evidently in the folk or peasant class of a group or cul- ture. For a simple folk who have no contact with advertised g·enius and ut, .tl1at stlfnclard or apprecia-. tion is as real and as fh 4 m as that of their descendants, -who may live in a state of higher p1•essure. In fact, the folk arc 111 ore real and more firm because the arc, of force eleme11tal and fundam.ental. Their spirits are less crowded with stim- ulae; their minds are less prejud- iced with syndicated knowledge. It is, then, at once easy to say that. in folk music we have the most real expression of what a gt·oup or race believes to be good; and of· what then 111ust be good; a funda- mental expression of their spirits, of .their sincere respotJsc s to those phenomena of the life with which Advance Showing of.

Even now, the three liners California 1 Virginia 1 and Pennsylva11ia, constitute the largest fleet of turbine-electric commercial ships in the world. Besides propelling these ships, electricity hoists freight, raises anchors, mans pumps, tutns rudders, drives winches, and warps the vessels into their berths.

Track Candidates Wanted- In the Bell System re- search and development ate not confined to engi- neering laboratory. These methods are applied also to the commercial side of the business, to make telephone service more and more useful. An example is·the classified telephone di- rectory, with its convenient listings by trade and pro1ession,. for quick and easy reference. Or take this other use of the classified directory. Telephone men analyzed advertis- ing and. merchandising, They saw that pros- pective purchasers of advertised products often dici not know where to buy them. They developed a plan for listing these dealers under t:h.eir brand name in local \Where to Buy It'' directories- a genuine service to buyer a11d seller alike. BELL SYSTEM v1 nation-wide system of inter-cotriJ~r:titJg telephotJts Coach Bruce has issued a call for more indoor :track can-· didates. The number of runners who have reported for the· winter seas~n so faT is large, but does not neady equal the in-· door squad of past seasons. Perhaps this js due to the fact, that :pteparation for arduous ·examinations kept veterans and new recruits from reporting for practice after Christmas, at the beginning of the winter track season. This obstacle is now removed. The college needs more candidates f01.· lii.door Track. and Field, if a successful season is to be hoped for. Field men. arc needed. Runners for the middle and long distances are needed. A spring track team is as strong as its indoor track team. The call has been issued. It is hoped that ~t will be an- swered. \0 U R PI 0 NEE RING W 0 R K HAS J U 5 T BEGUN.,

At this time, the Glee club presented three negro spirituals. Probably the best and climaxing feature of the pro- . gram was presented by the Garnet Goblins. Besides, rendering sever- al popular songs of the day as an orchestra they brought with them an added attraction in,.the form of a vocal sextet. This was compos- ed of the following men: William F. Bonnell, '32; Ward W. Briggs, '.32; William D. Brooke, '3r; James W. Haviland, '32; William Smith, '.31 and Edward Wintersteen, '31. These singers were dressed three as women and three as men. Their rendition ot songs popular thirty years ago called for many encores. The concluding group featured the Glee club in its fourth appearance. They sang Hadyn Wood's \Brown Bird Singing\ as one of their sel- ections and concluded the program with the \Entrance and March of the Peers'' by Sir Arthur Sullivan. At the close of the concert danc- ing was furnished to the music of the Garnet Goblins in the high school gymnasium.

There is a possibility, as suggested by the A1nl~,erst Stu,dent · last year, that the championship intramural teams, after weath- ering a series of contests in the college, have compeltition with championship intramural teams from other 'colleges.. In this way aE men in college have .an opportunity to take part i11 athletics, and the benefits of athletic exercise are received by everyone instead of the select few who benefit unde:r the present system of varsity teams. A suggestion to this eifeot brought up at the Little Three parley last year was turned dmvn speedily. The itime was not ripe. We 1vould not be surprised, however, to see intramurals increase their importance on all college campuses to such an e:xltent that they will gradually cause the abolition of many of the varsity teams.

For with the completion of a new unit of the 0 kla- homa Gas & Electric Company's power sta- tion at this point, the total generating capacity was raised from 46;930to 87,130 horse.power. \ To keep these \horses' up to full working condition, and do it dheaply as possible, is no small job. Just the water required is 86,400,- ooo gallons daily, the equivalent of eight days' su-pply for Oklahoma City. The new generating unit was made necessary by the expansion ofindustrial activity through- out Oklahoma and particularly by the in- creased use of electric power by the oil industry. For it, improved valves., fittings, and piping, so vital to ·efficient and economical power production, were supplied by Crane Co. Thus in these modern titnes does progress in one industry bring progress in another. No matter what branch of engineering you enter after graduation, you are likely to find Crane piping materials essential tools of your profession. In the Crane book, \Pioneering in Science,\ is told the story of Crane research in metallurgy, with important scientific data and high pressure and. temperature curves.

The Union debaters scored their first victory by defeating Swarth- more last night by a unanimous decision. The topic for debate was: \Resolved that the evils of the machine age outweigh its ben- efits.\ Union upheld the negative.

Removing mental barriers ln the Bell Telephone System men are constantly studying new ways to make the customer's dealings with the company easy and pleasant. The new \counter- less\ idea, now being introduced in the telephone company's business offices, is a ease in point. Here the customer is placed at once on a friendly personal basis with the company representative. He is invited to sit down comfortably and discuss his business. C~r­ tainly more satisfactory than standing at a counter • This s,ingle instance represents a point of view which telephone men think is im- portant.

What the ordinary curriculum represents LS simple, the accumu- ated debris of the past three hundred years of hit-or-miss instruction.\ In this article Edward Wilber Berry, known as the degreeless dean becaus.e he has never \been to college,\ launches the most vigorous attack as yet leveled a1t the American college system. The problem of what to do with the college curriculum has long been discussed m academic circles. Almost daily the question becomes more dif- ficult. At some universities, as at Union, the honors course system has been adopted m an effort to afford some relief, but still the prob- lem r-emains. It is only too true, that \a great deal of tirne IS being wasted-some because of worthless courses and some because of anti- quated methods of teaching•\ Dean Berry's article Is worth reading. It should prove of value to all who are interes'l:.ed in education, whether undergraduates or mentber,s of the faculty. • * • them is theirs for the asking. A BETTER RELATIONSHIP The dinner tendered by 1 t.he college last night for the Schenectady Rotary club was hailed by President Day as the beginning of a more intimate relationship between the city and the college. It IS sincerely to be hoped that this step which ts certainly in 1 the right direction will not be allowed to die a natural death but> that it will be fostered and built up into a last- ing tie between the two. There IS a great deal of good tha 1 t can he derived by both the college and the townspeople by a more intimate relationship between the two. The Rotary club by the establishment of their scholarship and the Chamber of Com- merce by their banquet m honor of Union's teams have shown that they are willing to meet the Student body halfway. It 1s now up to.· the undergraduates to .show that they appreci- ate the interest being taken m the college by · these people.
