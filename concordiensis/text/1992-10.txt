Founded at VOLU·ME 122, NUMBER 2 SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK OCTOBER 1, 1992 Co-Author of Pete Rose: My Story Addresses Aud·ience.at M.em:orial Chapel by Greg Midland Contributing Writer Roger Kahn, author ·of severa_l. ~baseball books including The Boys of Summer and Games We Used to Play, came to Union's Memorial Chapel on Wednesday, September 23rd for a lecture entitled \Story Without a Hero: Pete Rose, Publishing, .and the American Press.\ A prominent writer for the Sports Departments 0f The New York Herald Tribune, Newsweek. and The Neyy York Times, Kahn was invited to j speak at Union as part of the College's Portraying America lecture series. Those who came to hear him speak were treated to an often humorous and very insightful talk by a man who learned a great deal from his first-hand experiences with major American publishing companies and with Pete Rose himself. He addressed specifically \those who desire to. write,\ expressing sincere admiration for the intense committment and certain amoun-t of \craziness\ which he said combine to make a Stlccessful writer. During the first part of -the lecture, Kahn explained the circumstances that led to his involvement with Pete Rose's biography. Kahn found himself \thrust onto the manufactured book circuit,\ which he believed to be comparable to someone like Gen. Norman Schwartzkoff getting paid six millio11 dollars to write a .book that was done \for celebrity\ and that \lacks heart.\ According t() Kahn's. agent, Pete Rose wanted to tell Kahn \his story\ •. and a publishing company was willing to pay him a million dollars to write tbe book. Although Kahn was skeptical . ::. ..· In This Issue: Perot's Return -p. 5 at first of doing the work, he soon found himself being \seduced\ by Rose and his \charm\. Rose took him for rides in exotic sports cars and brought him to fancy tetmis clubs. The dive into the world of celebrity and lite.rary sensationalism had begu11 for Kahn. Writing about a \one- dimensional man\. was difficult. according to Kahn. He described Rose as being \smart\ and \shrewd b11t not very knowledgeable of topics other than baseball. Then,. one day, Rose came to Kahn out of the blue and told him that he never bet on baseball but that \people\ were contacting his enemies to get information on his gambling. The \people\ Rose was referring to were reporters, mostly from S&>orts Illustrated, who received information that some of Rose's gambling exploits may have been illegal. A. Bartlett Giamatti, the Commissioller of Baseball at the time, along with his successor Fay Vincent, began to conduct their own investigation into the accusations, for fear of ll breaking the story first. It was at this time that Kahn said \he knew something was up, smqething that would change his life and the book.\ By now. the original publishing company had long since bailed out of the deal with Rose and Kahn to avoid connection with the possible Rose indictment. A new offer had since come in, b11t at a lower price. Media coverage of the story was becoming extremely intense, whicl,. Kahn criticized harshly in his lecture. Roger Kahn likened what was happening to Pete Rose to \a mugging in an alley.\ orchestrated primarily by Giamatti and Vincent. The evidence was inconclusive. in :::- : ... : .. : Career Fest -p. 2 Sideburns ala Carte -p.15 his opinion, and there were many ambiguous issues that were never properly add.ressed. This gave the case an aura similar to the c<lnttoversy surrounding the assassination of JFK. Pete Rose told Roger Kahn that \the media damaged baseball, not me.\ Whether or not Pete Rose bet on baseball was not the focus of Kahn's lecture. In fact, he never actually stated whether or not he believed the allegatiolls. The main theme of the lecture was the displeasure that Kahn expressed with the media and its handling of the situation, along with ~he current trend towards trivial and \manufactured\ books ~hat have become so prevalent in our society. According to Kahn, it seems every time there's an opportunity for someone to tell a story that has all of the necessary elements to attract readers (sex, violence,; etc.), a publishing company is there waiting for the rights to print it. Roger Kahn made the point that we need to get away from this trend, and move towards books that are written for their pure literary value and not simply for the opportunity to make a fast buck. Kahn finished the book Pete Rose: My Story as a tribute to a man who, despite any wrongdoings, was victimized by the media and is in danger of never being recognized in the Baseball Hall of Fame, where he most certainly belongs. The lecture had a simple message: beware of literature that lacks a certain depth and meaning, it's never a substitute for the real thing. -, Susan Kana To Lecture Never Diet Again • • by Somme Daulat Contributing Writer Are you constantly telling yourself not to eat this or that? Is each meal a mathematical calorie- counting test that you seem to be failing? Food is a basic necessity for survival. but in the wrong quantities it can lead to a variety of .complex problems. Susan ICano, a specialist on eating disorders, will be answering these questions and more in a lecture entitled \Never Diet Again\ on October 5th. Kano will be spe.aking about bow to use natural mechanisms to lose weight, why diets fail in the long run, and even bow diets can make one fatter. Kano's lecture will be presented to college- age students uound the country. Rating disorders . seem to be quite a secretive issue, and Union hopes to open some closed doors through the lecture. Professor Spring. of the counseling center, said \We're not trying to become food police, but instead, hope to give those in need just enough help. As young adults they will naturally be concerned about body image, but there is a healthy and unhealthy way to do it.\ Kano has written Mak.ing Peace With Food, a book addressed to any type of dieter, as well as to anorexics, and bulimics. This book is being used by many hospitals and clinics in the US, England and Brazil. Mrs. Kano developed an interest in eating disorders when her own life became centered on body weight, and she became a borderline anorexic. She has appeared several times on T.V. and radio talk shows promoting her \natural weight control\ method and discussing the evils of dieting. The multiple effects of eating disorders, and the importance of bringing the issue to public attention is reflecte<l in the numerous departments involved in bringing Kano to speak at Union. Contributors include the Psychology .. Health, and Athletics departments as well as Dining Services. Sororities on campus and the Women's Studies Department were also involved. Julie Schlang, President of the Panhellenic League says, \All the sor<lrities have donated money because they feel it is a problem not only with those in the Greek system but with college-aged women in general.\ However, the issue should not be confined to wome11, as men are also victims of eating disorders. For men, the problem is usually with trying to gain weight. As Professor Spring says. \:Eating disorders are a social Jlroblem found in the · upper middle class. making Union a prime target.\ Susan Kano will be speaki11g on October 5th at 7:00 p.m. in Memorial Chapel.

In response to the attacks, the President has attempted to characterize Bill Clinton as 'elite', according to a .September 25th article in the Washington Post.

Mr. President, quite simply, you are the one who is responsible for making mudslinging such a big part of the election. Why do you believe that you do not have to answer to the American people? Largely because you have a lot to hide. You have lied to the American people. The reason why you have resorted to attacking Governor Clinton is because, in the last four years, you have done absolutely nothing to . improve the quality of life for the average American. It is time for the American people to realize this and vote you out as chief executive As our leader, you have shown us that to neglect the people for whom you are . responsible is allowable, and to 1 blame other individuals for ·! your failure is justifiable.

Mr. President, quite simply. you are the one who is responsible for making mudslinging such a big J)art of the election. Why do yo11 believe that you do not have: to answer to the Ame:rican people? Largely because you have a lot to hide. You llave lied to the American people. The reason why you have resorted to attacking Governor Clinton is because, in tbe last four years, you have done absolutely nothing to im{)rove the quality of life for the ~tv~rage American. It is time for the American people to relllize this and vote you out as chief executive As our leader, you have shown us that to neglect the people for whom you are • responsible is allowable, and to blame other individuals for your failure is justifiable. It is · so easy to blame Congress for 1 every downturn in the quality 1 of life in this co11ntry.

Ross P~rot's name pops up once agai11 in headlines across the countty. It was on!Jy about ten weeks ago that Perot- his popularity f~ling rapidly- decided his presen.ce in the general election would do more hann than good. Perot maintained that if he caused tb.e race to be deadlocked (which would leave the Congress to detennine a wiflner) the blame would be his.

Now, with ·just over thirty days left until the election, the Texas billionaire is contemplating a glorious return. Many who deemed Perot a coward and quitter just a few months back have now changed their tone, with the focus now on the quirky way in which Mr. Perot seems to make some monumental decisions. It's hard to argue with these critics, especially when you look back at the evolution of this most bizarre race. Perot stonned on the national scene claiming that he was sick and tired of our government- both the President and Houses of Congress- pointing fingers and .running in circles. He was most outraged at the way Mr. Bush has handled fiscal matters. in this country. Given that the staggering economy has been and still is the top voter issue, Perot gained instant acclaim as a shrewd businessman- someone who could carry out the task of fixing a huge budget deficit When things began to get close though, and all three candidates were hovering around the 30% mark in popularity, Perot bolted and left Bill Clinton as the benefactor of many of his defectors. Since then, the Arkansas governor hasn't looked back. The Clinton/Gore lead has settled at anywhere from 10·15 points, and it's obvious at this junctme that the Democrats have the ticket with momentum. What happens should Perot fonnally announce that he's to begin formal campaigning again? Will there be severe repercussions to the other two candidates? The consensus is yes, with Mr. Bush suffering the most. Ross Perot has made no secret of the fact that a fourth consecutive term of Republican . rule is unacceptable. While most feel the Texan has no chance of winni11g, a great number concede tllat he can have a profound vot~ng influence in key geographic regions. Texas for example is Perot's ho-me state, the adopted home of George Bush. yet a place where Clinton is polling very well. Sllould Perot become active again, he will .probably cut into Bush's support because now the President will have to fight off two challengers who will be constantly grilling Bush's record since 1988. That will leave Clinton a clear path to claiming a s.ignificant amou11t .of electoral votes in a place o11ce thought to be a given for Republicans. Florida, Ohio, and Michigan- all rich with electmal votes and targeted as 'hotspots' this election season- have the potential to do much the same damage to the Republicans as Texas. Especially if Mr. Perot HELP CREATE A NEW WORI< sees fit to inject some of his fire into the frenzy. My own interpretation of the return of Ross Perot is a bit more ideological and no doubt overly optimistic. Nevertheless, I believe that a third candidate will make the Republican and Democratic candidates work even harder for the support they hope to attain in the stretch run. In short, I think it will force both Bush and Clinton to be better and in the end the decision for President will be much clearer to Americans thanks to Perot. Finally, I predict that the voter tmnout for this election will be one of the higbest in recent years.

Along with the elimination of such parties, ,Ita s come the elimination of any sort of weeknight ~;o.cial activity. I know wh~tt you. re going to say- Chet'::s. well, yeah, but Chet's is o11ly- open one night during the \lleek. What is there to offer the otter three nights? What are oar alternati-ves? That is tile. question I was constantly asking myself. Then I discov:ered Bingo at the Annie Schaeffer Senior Center (across frorn A.-plus). I can't t~U you how many times I've driven by Annie's (tb.at's what I like to call it now tltat I'm a regular), and thot1ght, \Hmm Bingo. Sounds like fun, J>.ut it's just for old ,people.\' Well thank you Union C()lle ge administration for ab<Jlishing weeknight parties, becau.se if it weren't for that milch appreciated new policy, I would have gone right on thinking that way. I am now proud to say I am a Bingo · addict. I even got one of those bumper stickers for my cars that says \This vehicle brakes for ail Bingo games\. It all started about a week ago. It was a Monday night, my work was done, and damn it, I was going out. It was . early, so once I accepted the fact t.bat there was absolutely no11ling to do on campus, andi despite my determination, I. would be staying in, I headed for A -.IJlus to get some snacks to eat while I watched \Rescue 911\ (Holy run-on sentence!). Leaving A-plus with a bag of Nacho Cheesier Doritos in hand, something caught my eye. It was like a beacon in the night, beckoning to me, \BINGO TONITE 7:30P.M.!\ \This is it!\ I realized excitedly, \I am going out!\ I ran home as fast as my little legs would carry me, burst into my room and told my roommates the news, \Guys~ we're going to Bingo tonight!\ Needless to say, they did not share my enthusiasm, but I didn't care, and with spirits only slightly dampened, I went anyway. I entered the Annie Center (another nickname) with a bit of trepidation. Ahead of me was a large, smoke-filled room with rows of tables filled with people, and at the front was a giant round wire basket that was spinnillg, and when it stopped, an elderly, stocky, bald man with glasses pulled out a ball, and read the letter and number to the group of anxiously awaiting seniors.

I realized that I was excited for her, ran over to the table where. the cards were sold, bought t\ltlo at a dollar a piece,. and joi11ed in the action. I ·had Bingo fever. I staye4 until the bitter end (well, ten-thirty). I never won, but I saw pictures of Mrs. Englebert's grandchilclren, listened to Ethel and Margm-et's hints on how to make your dentures stick, drank free coffee, and ate free donuts. All that excitement for only two dollars. How can y~u go wrong? Maybe I still h~-.,en 't convinced all of you how great Bingo is.

Call Damon Keller and ask him why he talks like that. Get a piggy..:back ride from the Chester Arthur statue. Give your roommate a pedicure. Breed cats in your dorm room. Discover the wonderful world of needlepoint. Hand wash all of your underwear. · Well that's all I can come up with. Maybe the rest of you are distraught about this whole party thing, but not me.

Heffner Contributing Wrf.ter until I saw hO<w the otlJ.er half lives. are relentless drivers who won't stop for anyone including American tourists who are unsure of the roads. ---------------------·· Venice! As I, along with ,my family, exited the airport as the sun was rising, I saw what seemed like an endless mass of water around us. .An overly tanned Italian man usher(}d us onto a boat, whlch was an equivalent to our taxis. His tan was certainly a tip that he was European for most Americans in this day and age WO<uld never let their skin become that fried. My th()ugb.ts of rapid travel by boat were quickly disproved as I heard horns and saw a traffic jam on the Grand Canal, the main waterway. The ninety five degree heat didn't stop our taxi driver from clressing in his formal Italim suit, though. While I was sweating bullets, the weather didn't seem to phase him at all. His chic, Italian style remained untouched by the heat as my body wilted with every passing moment. Florence was my next place of exploration. The fO<Xl was definitely the highlight of my stay here... Pasta with meat sauce, othetwise known as Pasta Bolognese, in Italian, was the recommended dish at eY<ery restaurant we frequented.. lf I had lived in Fl&rence fo:r the rest of my life, I would IJot hav~ eaten enou~h of it, For five days, I sat,. covered with sunscreen, beside the Mediterranean while women soaked their completely naked bodies in oil. It was at that moment that I realized one of the fundamental differences between Americans and Europeans. For that past week in Italy, I thought I had been enamored by the Italian's eccentric style. What I was really taken by was their whole attitude of self expression. While many Americans are caught up in the boundaries of their culture, the Italians don't live within such defmed lines. As 1 entered the school in ~hich I was to learn Italian, before my trip to Italy, I vas overwhelmed with excitement. The dll!k mahogany v.a~Is were drap-ed with posters of the Italian flag and sna1p sb.ots of Italim pastries. This was my very first exposur-e to this foreign and exotic cuLture in which I was to inv<>lve myself for the next two !lll..C a. half weeks. After taking a1 basic course in Italian, I was off to Italy, with the ability to introdu.ce myself in ItaJi:an, or even a..sk directions! My first, md favorite stop, At one o'clock in the afternoon, all of the stores and non-governmental institutions shut down for three hours to rest and take a breather from their hectic. days. \What a civilized way of life,\ I thought. \I wish I could sit under an umbrella and sip cappuccino for three· hours everyday.\ ... Somehow, I don't think I could, thou.gh. When it comes down to it, if Americans have too much work, they want to rest. Yet, when they have no work, they crave activity. I guess I didn't realize just how much I need to be busy l.E.F. DF.AOLINF. Our third stop was Posita:no, a little village :in the s()~th of Italy. To get to our h()tel, we had to drive on the «:lge of winding mountains, on which there was no S)leed limit. . Our voyage fr()m Florence has got to be oneo of the most anx: iety ridden experiences, for the Italians The deadline for proposals for the Internal Education founcl~tion in two categories; -· stuJeJilt-Lnitiated Iese;:Jrch projects and \educationnlly innov~uive projects'' is October 30, 1992.

As I landed in Kennedy Airport, in New York, at the· conclusion of my trip, I felt as if I definitely brought a part of Italian culture home with me. Beside from the photographs and memories ·that I will always have, I am now more attuned to the nuances of another culture and have even taken some of the Italian's customs to heart.

I announced my intentions of entering the wide open ra-ce for the throne of the United States president. \Clinton and Bush Can Kiss My Tush!\ was the battle cry as I began my quest to kick some political butt and woo the electorate onto my political bandwagon.

Yes sir, I'll put us back between Canaaa and Mexico and into our untouchable niche as hard headed democracy willing to kill thousands in it's quest to ensure a peace loving world. I, ladies and genHemen, am the Ross Perot of Ross Perots. I don't have millions of dollars and I'm ,certainly not as good looking as old H. \I look like Frank Perdue\ Perot, but I do have one thing going for me. Unlike Ross, I'm still in the race. Yes, it seems that ol' Ross did what George Bush's father should have done and pulled out early. What was once a four-man free-for-all is now a three-way scramble with me as the only independent on the ticket. So now I ask you, gentle voters, what could possible be better than having a president willing to cut taxes, cut spending, cut the cheese, and cut the bullshit.

How about hot tea. It's fun, delicious and easy to make. If you're feeling really wild, you can try those herbal tea's. 2. Breakdancing: Throw on some RUN-DMC, put on your adidas and relearn the moonwalk:. 3. Grow facial hair: Everybody loves this exciting time consuming activity. Cultivate your own distinctive facial hair pattern. Grow big circles of hair on your cheeks. Go wild!! 4. Kidnapping: Steal kids from the local neighborhood and duct tape 'em to your wall. Makes an excellent wall decoration. This may also lead to a fun and exciting night in jail. 5. Perform amputations on yourself in the privacy ()[ your dorm room: Everybo<iy loves cutting off their own <Jwn limbs. 6. Start a urine sample collection: Beats collecting stamps. If you're real adv.enturous try collecting pap smears. Swap and tra<le with your friends. 7. Eat aluminum: Stop recycling your cans and start eating 'em. Most people aren't aware that aluminum is the fifth basic food grouJ}. Try some aluminum Parmesan or aluminum tacos. Can't l>e any worse than what they serve at West. 8. Use squirrels as fa.shion accessories: Grab a sq ui:rrcl from the wild and pin him to your shirt. Better than wearing a tie. 9. Use toothpaste as a dietary supplement: It's healthier than aluminum. 10. Do some homework for class: Only kidding.

How will they react to the newly enforced policies of weekday partying, or the lack of any fraternity parties on campus during orientation? How will they handle each other, in such a large number? Would orientation advis()rs have to drag them throu8h the frrst week of events, or will the freshmen show enthusiasm? My investigative partner fen Kruger and I set out to ~et the freshman perspective on their first week at Union. We walked the halls of West, looking for a helpful freshman t() inquire. We found the same enthusiastic spirit inside the dorm that has been so apparent since orientation started. Io fact, the atteodance at all orientation events was extremelyg uncommonly high.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 1, 1992 • PAGE 10 Stricter Drinking Policies Emerging Nationwide A New Survey On Student Drinking Has Administrations Up In Arms A recent nationwide survey on student drinking has caused college administrators around the country to be up in arms. Of the respondents, 42 per cent claimed that they had consumed five or more d.r~nks in one .sitting within a two-week period. As a result, many colleges have introduced policies to curb this habit, Union included. These policies, which are being imtroduced or enforced after lengthy periods of leniency, are, in most places, here: to stay. This does not please most of the members of the various social 'scene&' who have come to abide by the theory that college is the place to .get 'partying' out of one's system before entering the 'real' world. However, a person who takes this sort of thinking to an extreme-and there are quite a few-represents the deep-seated problems that exist throughout the American educational system. ~here I believ~ that many students throughout the nation have gone astra;y. They e;~tlter :do not !h.mk about the consequences of their actions, or they de n~t care. The res~ltmg peltctes by. ~lleg~s are ~ttt:mpts to forcibly control students' drinking habtts, wtth the admtmstratlons clrummg to be acting in the best interests of the students. H~wever, such strict .regulations almost seem to be supporting the view that. ~liege ts not meant to be taken too seriously. As we mature, we make our own dec:ISt()nS, and learn from their consequences how to handle similar situations in the futlllre. Holding our hands will not do us much good in the long run· letting us make our own decisions will. ' We ru.:e a very fortunate country to be able to send such a high percentage of our population to college. Yet for many the opportunities .provided in a c<Jllege atmosphere are simply overlooked. At this point, the necessity of attending college in order to acquire suitable employment should be re-evaluated. ]n other words, if we aren't going to take it seriously, why bother at all? The reader should not conclude fimm my previous statements that I subscribe to the theory 'all work and no play'. On the contrary, I fumly believe in the necessity of some routine recreation. I li.lso believe that all things should be done responsibly, after weighing both the positive and negative aspects. And this is [ d() not want to end this without suggesting possible solutions· not to ·do so would confine this article to the category of idle complaint. The 'school faces a number of choices in its handling of this .situation.

'This is a very ltmll~d ~upply '?f a~cohol. Since the college feels it must regulate our on- camplls dri.nking habits, 1t should cre~e alternatives, starting with opening Chet's on ·otller ntghts. Another proposal mtght be to include a bar in the soon-to-be- opened Student Activities Building which would totally avoid the 'cheap-hotel- loJBnge atmosphere' that seems to result from the lack of any :decoration that might separa1e Chet's from the rest of the College Center.

Bathroom Wails in Academic Halls A Continuing Perspective on Sexism at Union by Mirriam Seddiq Contributing Writer One day last week I stumbled upon a fantastic women's forum. It happened quite accidentally. I was taking a break from researching my thesis topic and w~dered into the second stall of the women's bathroom in Schaeffer Library. Lo! To my surprise, there was the voice of Union College. In this column, I thought I might share with you some of the thoughts that are etched into those grimy green walls. I believe it is only fair to have these fine words printed here where it is accessible to all-- not just those few women who frequent the Schaeffer library bathroom. The first thing that caught my eye was a statement directed towards a certain sorority on campus: 'You are all a--h----. Why don't you concentrate on making yourselves better people before you attack others! Look at yourself. Are you the best you can be?' To this someone had responded: 'No, but even my mediocrity is better than your best.' Hmmm ..... . Another woman commented: 'If you hate them [the sorority] so much, why waste your time?' The person who had originally made the statement against the sorority replied: '.Because when people just sit back and let the world go by without taking any action- nothing gets accomplished! I bet you don't even vote!' And then there was an e11lightened soul. Someone who, perhaps, took pity on the attack against the sisterhood and wrote: 'Why don't women 011 this campus learn to stick together and to look out for each other instead of wasting time bitching, bickering and back-stabbing.' I'm sure that the men on this campus would lilce to know what the women really think of them. Well, if you look behind the door of stall #2 you '11 find a list of various adjectives used by women to describe the men at Union College. For example: 'Men are: Pigs; sluts; wonderful; sperm spouting (!) miserable yet wonderful humans; precious; nut munching squirrels; slimy acorn hoarding rodents; miserable; awesome- at least mine is.' Hmmm .... Well, I think one person had it pegged when she wrote the following: 'That's what the anonymity ()f graffiti is for; most women at this college are either to 10naware or too afraid to speak ()Ut against the men_' Someone resp()nded by writing: 'Damn right - f-----· sheep who will marry these swine and be miserable for the rest of their lives.' One woman wa:; obviously offended by the sheep analogy. SIJ.e wrote: •y ou turbo feminists; you are as sexist as any man on campus; You are man-haters! Get a reaJ. project- -concentrate on e-qual wages not on stupid sex.ist sayings. They give femi11ism a bad name.' I think letting p;eople know what's on your milld is a great thing. However, I'm not really sure if I'm thrilled arbout the way these women cll.oose to express their views. First of all, it doesn't seem to be very productive--no one: kncws why you're writing what you're writing or who the hell you are. Secondly, there is a great portion of the campus who will never have the oppor:tunity to know what's really going on. It is precisely that portion that doesn't have acc~s that needs to, know. Finally, I know that a 'lot of the time I forget to I bring my pen i11to the bathroom and then I feel like a dark if people see me leave the bathroom, get a )leD, and then go back in. Perhaps in my llalvete I simply do not w81lt to believe that the followin.g comment holds true: 'Ergo: To fin.<l. out what people really thi11k read the graffiti, not the letters to the editor.' Hmmm .... All submissions to Concordiensis are due the Tuesday before publication by SPM if they are submitted on Microsoft Word Macintosh Disks.

Bartell Features Editor I stand a man confused, baffled, and full of questions. The new Union College social policy has me -for lack of a less colloquial word- stumped. The Union I love and used to know has been distorted to the point of iirecognition. Oh, the buildings are still the same and most of the people are very familiar but something has been changed. The pleasant look of social satisfaction which used to paint the face of Union students has been replaced with a look of gross disillusionment. The Union College that they, (and I), applied to is gone. When I applied to Union, I applied knowing that I could fmd a safe place to relax and socialize. When i applied I knew that I wouldn't have to venture into the dark reals of Schenectady to satisfy my social needs. I could socialize on campus, at fraternities. What's more I could do it as an independent. I am an independent, but I like fraternities. I like them all and so I didn't pledge. Parties were open and I was welcomed to all with open anns. Now I find mvself in a grand paradox. The new social policy designed to limit the role of fraternities has in fact put added pressure on me, the independent, to join one. Parties being so exclusive and invitational have made me very nervous. Where am I to go? I am seriously considering pledging a fraternity this year to avoid the social dilemma of not having a place to go .. and meet people, and relax. And so it is that by trying to de-emphasize the role of fraternities, a grand new. emphasis has been placed on Greek life. Joining a fraternity isn't my only option, however. I could go to bars. Drive from the friendly gates of Union into the dark city where I am not comfortable or at all happy. I didn't apply to Union because I liked Schenectady. I didn't come here to mingle with the town folk. If I had known I was going to be driven off campus I would have gone to school in a city that I liked. I came to Union because I felt safe here and at home. I wasn't at all unsure of what I would do socially. Now I am a man confused. But this problem doesn't end with me. I look around and see the bulk of the freshman class struggling to hang on. Many are homesick, and many more are disillusioned that the Union College they carne to live at isn't the same Union that they came to visit. There iS very little for them to do and even fewer chances to develop upperclass friendships. They are dismayed and frankly, I feel sorry for them, and for the rest of us placed in a state of 110certaintv. Union and I fell in love l~st year. The consummation of our passion was in the spirit we shared. This spirit was bred by the relaxation and friendships I developed as an independent via the fraternity system. I felt safe, I felt at home and we, Union and I, bonded as one. I still love Union, but now more like an aunt than a wife. But as we all know aunts are loved more on holidays, when they bring gifts. Unfortunately for Aunt Union, I love her on holidays too. That's when I get to go home-and tell stories- of how it used to be.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 1, 199:2 • PAGE 11 Repu:rcussions of Administration's New Social Policies To the Editor: The recent enforcement of long standing policies at Union m:arks a trend at the college to limit social life on campus, particularly as it applies to the numerous Greek institutions at Union. As the policy stands, ·Greeks cannot serve alcohol (presumably beer) from mass containers during the week or risk immediate social probation. 011ly on weekends may a house register a party and ,thus be aU owed to serve kegs to a large number of people. On weeknights there can be no more than twenty non-brothers at a given house, and no alcohol may be served. In theory, these regulations are to limit the drinking on campus, but the effects of this policy may be more far reaching than this goal and greatly deleterious to the student body and the reputation of the college. First, the number that the school prescribes as a limit for weekday gatherings· will only result in a polarization of the campus, fractionating it into smaller and smaller subgroups. With houses allowed to welc(lrne a few people nightly for fear of the punitive repercussions, the organization will only .:.ulmit its closest friends. Thls limited admission will cause suspicion of those who are not known to the house and soon the campus will be· divided into groups .of people friendly at a given house or to none at all. Union, and tile Greeks who reside within its confines, has always prided itself o n its openness and friendly atmosphere. Such an atmosphere cannot exist witll the persecution of the administration. Second, the administration has maintained, and rightly so, that drinkin.g need not be the mainstay of social life at Union College. Though it is present, drinking is not the only attraction o-f a Greek social event. Students ca:n go to a house and not drink, but merely talk to or meet people. The alcohol is there, though, for those students who are of age and who ch{)se to imbibe. Choice, here, is the ultimate ll).::.ue, for no one is forced to drink or even to attend Greek gathetings, during the weekend or otherwise. Students who do chose to attel!d, however, do so of their own volition and should not be restricted in that choice. Another issue is the fact that the college had provided almost no alternative to the Greek social scene. On weekends there are bands or movies in the College Center, but neither event can accommodate all two thousand students at Union. On a recent night, Wednesday, September 16, Greek organizations were not permitted to hold social functions and on that same night there was not a single option provided to the student body by the college or d.~ administration. It cannot be assumed that students can simply go off campus for entertainment because not everyone has access to a car and often such activities are prohibitively expensive. In this sense the now enforced social policy may be an attempt to boost academics at Union, but no one needs the eleven hours between the last class on Wednesday and the time a The Una·ppreciated Term Abroad To the Editor: Today I am writing to tell the College about the biggest, most challenging, and least known ()f the many Union terms abroad. When President Hull set forth the goal of a mandatory term abroad for each and every Union student, those of us in the Social Sciences were quite surprised. For, as many of you who have just completed your senior theses well know, students majoring in any one of the Social Sciences already participate in a mandatory term abroad program in their senior year. I refer, or course, to the under-ap:preciated term abroad at the State University of New York at Albany Library. The SUNY Albany Library term abroad is challenging, exciting, .and rewarding. First, it involves the unparalleled difficulty of finding a place to put your car without having it towed by the vigilantly fascist SUNY Albany police, encouraging student creativity. Also it develops the ability, increasingly important in American society and particularly at Union), to deal with small minded bureaucracy, through exposure to the arbitrary, unfriendly, power lmngry librarians at SUNY Albany (who are perhaps even more bureaucratic than our own administrators). Furthennore, the term aoroad at SUNY Albany Library is unique to Union College. Students at other area colleges, being in th~ unfortunate position of actually having adequate library facilities available to them at their ow1z school, do not get to avaii themselves of a term abroad at SUNY Albl.Wy Library. Their schools, having short-sightedly provided sufficient library resources, have arbitrarily restricted their students' incentive to spend large amounts of time at the libraries of other schools. Thus, as it is ever eager to do, Union is able ·to claim to be a \cutting edge\ innovator in higher education, providing its students with an unprecedented academic ·opportunity and travel experience. , Finally, the SUNY Albany I Library term abroad program (in the sound and intelligent spirit of 'mnrring a college like a business') brilliantly exposes a maxim11IIi amount of students to the experience of a term abroad at a minimum cost: By ingeniously failing tc provide adequate library resources here at Union, the College not only necessitates that all senior thesis students spend .significant amounts of time at SUNY Albany Library, but also saves the College the huge sums of money whicb would otherwise be wastefully expended on the Union library. The money saved is diverted to the purpose of expanding the number and staff of our ultra- efficient administrators, who are then better equipped to come up with and implement even more exciting innovations. The rewarding end result of all this administration, innovation, and cost-effectiveness is, of course, the low tuition we students enjoy. Thus I encourage Union students t() take the time to recognize and appreciate the financial acumen, dizzying intellect, and innovative spirit· behind Uni()n's term abroad at SUNY Albany Library; as a result of this program, all we have to do to make every student participate in a term abroad is make them all write a senior thesis. The money which wo11ld otherwise be wasted on expanding existing terms abroad or on improving the library is saved for more useful functions, like division one hockey and President Hull's proposed \chunnel\ between the Nott and the library. In closing, I praise the success of the great Union College administrative spirit of doing something by doing nothing. Sincerely, as ever, Marc Kuritz '92 , Student goes to sleep to study, life.

Students Sincerely, Jared Seiter Vice-Presid·ent Delta Phi come to college to expand their horizons ami experiment with Concerned Students To the Editor: It is obvious that over summer recess the College and it's administration have come to definite decisions concerning the college's social atmosphere. As two sociaL chairmen belonging to the Greek system, we wish to convey to you. the administration, many of the concerns we h.ave with the new changes. We fully understand your need to divert the attention of Union's social setting from the consumption of alcohol. It is also understood that the majority of drinking takes place within the fraternity system. The changes taking place, however, seem to be a bit too drastic for the college community. Although the rules of the administration have diverted the attention of the students from llrinking on campus. it has been proven over the past few weeks that more probleiDS e'list now than before. Union has alway-s provided a safe. enclosed, S()Cial setting within the college community. Unfortunately. the social setting; is slowly moving outside of the college's walls. It is impossible t(. think that the college will be able to stop students from drinking. The changes do nothing but encourage students t>O look elsewhere for alcohol consumption. With this comes many periLs, first an~ foremost being that students will drive under tile influence of alcohol. Are Ne going to !lave to wait for the first major alcohol related 11.cddent in which a Union student is involved in order t() realize that the new rules are more harmful than helpful?

Did you know that if you have sex with a person with venereal warts there's a 60% cbance you'll get the virus? Sometimes surgery is performed on genitals remove these warts and there's always the chance that they'll come back around whenever they feel like. There's also herpes, which will give you blisters on your. penis or vagina or your mouth (if you do things differently.) These sores are usually noticeable anywhere from 2 to 14 days after infection, and., when they break, it burns like hell to urinate. The worst part is, there is no cure- only treatment for symptoms.

Siddiqi Corttributing Writer On September 20, 1992 the French electorate ratified the ~aasaicht Treaty; in reality, 1t saved the European community. The Treaty, in the precise form ill which it was signed last February, is almost certainly past saving. The tasks 11ow facing European leaden are frrst, to decide how much of it they really want to save, and second to devise a way of doing so. Ironically, that is what many of those in Franc{) and elsewhere advocating rejection of the treaty want to see happen. Had tbe majority of French voters taken their advice. the chances ()f saving the treaty would have been much less. Not only would the treaty itself have been junked wholesale, but many of the EC's earlier 11chienments, if not its very existence, might have been jeopardized, in an atmosphere of which the last week's recriminati<ms gave an unpleasant foretaste. The treaty is past saving for several reasons. First, Denmark has already rejected it. Denmark sllows no sig11 of changing its mind, and elfen if they do. Dutch law may make it impossible for them t'() vote on a.n unaltered text. According to a Euro;pean banker, the forced departllfe of Britain and Italy from the exchange rate mechanism has also shown that the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union are mos1 unlikely to be met by more than an inner C(}l'e of North-Central Eur()pean countries. Finally, ill the course of the referendum campaign, France's leaders have made state111ents concerning Germany and the purpose of the Emu (common currency) which have strengthened the upidly growing misgivingS- in Gennany about the treaty. The two percent margin in favor of the Maastricht Treaty in the French referendum should keep the ERM alive. This is not because ratification of the Maastricht Treaty itself, let alone smooth progress towards economic and monetary union. have become certain. It is because the French people have demonstrated, however grudgingly, that there remains a majority in favor of European co-operation. On that basis, a two-tier ERM (narrowed and broad band) should be able to stand, but it will do so only if the Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany, shows greater commitment to the system than it has in the past. Recent events have confirmed that a semi-fixed exchange rate system has evident weaknesses. The managers of a currency under sever pressure can not save it on their own; beyond a certain point, they will run out of reserves. Since operators in having the United States and NATO defend them. However France and Germany do not agree. They would like to see a part of the Maastrict Treaty include a stronger statement of defense. Ironically this communal economy will be most appealing to m:.ny of the ex~Soviet the markets know this, they are bound to win any serious battle. Thms. the credibility of the parity- depends partly on the will of the authorities respo-nsible for the weaker curre11cy to defend it, and partly on their commitment to imp<Jse whatever interest rates may be required for as long as proves necessary (e.g. Swedien's 50()% overnight). But tile parity depends rather more on the perceived willimgness of those resp()nsible for the strongest currency to defend it. The governments of Italy and the UK failed all these tests - as also did other core ERM coulltries, including the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Nevertheless, the closeness of the French vote, as well as ~he fading possibility of Emu, ts bo;und to shake the market· s faith in the determination of this and future French governments to defend the parity. The economic conflicts survive? c~untries. Since they are the o11es with the weakest evomomies and least amount of u~able capital, joining the European Market would be perfect for them. As of yet. nDile of them have had the oppot:tunity to sign into this S()Cialist-styled economy.. Last week the European Clll'l'ency market waged war on itself as currencies dropped. r()se. then dropped again. As . ea~ily anticipated, France and Germany wound up the least bt~rt. Th~ French franc a11d Gem1an mark were able to bully tile rest of the European market - could this be a foreboding of tru11gs to come? Germany stepped in to help the French franc from loosing most of its value as other C<Jllntries' currencies were boandied about to fend for tl!emselves. Should all C<~untries on the doorstep of 11nification worry? The two big guys in the ring seem to be able tc accomplish whatever th.ey ~ant both politically and eciOnomically.

The ERM may now be more secure thall was feared a couple of week~ ago, but it is flll' from secure. lt is now mainly up to the Germans to remove these doubts. Should the Eundesbank, fresh from its victories over the UK and Italy, demonstrate that it is absolutely committed to maintaining the strength of the French Franc, regardless of the short-term effect on German money supply, then the franc 5hould be secure. If the Bundesbank is not committed 1he franc will be unable to resist the pressure that currency markets are now able to exert. This is not just an economic issue, it is also a political one. however technocraticaUy the Bundesbank might like to treat it. Emu or 110 Emu.

ON Ll BRARY FIELD, UNION C:OLLEGE CAMPUS. What and by Caroline Paine Contributing Writer Shakespeare once said, \All' the world\s a stage.\ Last year Union students and residents of Schenectady saw this phrase taken literally. On May 20 the Bread and Puppet Theater came to Union. uniting the campus and the community in a presentation of \Columbus: the New World Order\. Tb.e two gro11ps, combined by tb.e Bread and Puppet Theater, performed a pageant that started at the S chen ectad y Town Hall, marched through downtown and concluded at the Riverside Park. Tb.e objective of this performance was to bring the college closer to the community where it resides. This year the effort continues through a grant from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Arts Partners Program. Union College is fortunate to be one of seven organizations in the nation to receive this grant. Th.e grant provides for a three-part project dedicated to audience development and creating better community CONCORDiENSIS • OCTOBER 1. 19'2 o PAGE 14 I lS Bread Puppet? relations thr9ugh the arts. Bread and Puppet is tile oldest alternative theater group in the US and perhaps wmld wide. Since 1963 it has been performing shows containing themes of social, :political, and environmental controversy. Using hand puppets, costumed pelfonners and larger-than-life marionettes, the Bread and Puppet Theater S}Jarks e!lergy and excitement throughout its worldwide travels. As Bread and Puppet returns to Union there will be some changes. Last year the script was already written, and aU Union and Schenectady had to do was perform it. This year the play, \Fly or Die\ is still in the experimental stages. The plot is one of e11vironmental concerns. First-world citizens wallow in misery and unemployment, waiting for science to solve their problems. In the midst of this the Green Man of ancient legends C()mes out of hiding to bring the people out of their depression. He existed l()ng before Christianity, is disrespectful, and means business. The Green Man is also accompanied b} Mother Death-the person no one wants t() know but everyone at some ,point meets. To fmd out more about \Fly or Die\ come belp create it! There will ,be a meeting on Monday, Oct. 5,. 7 PM. at the Nott Memorial 'Theater. Peter Schumann, the founder and artistic director of the Bread and Puppet Th.eater will be conducting the workshops and meetings. \Peter Schumann is the innovating force behind Bread and Puppet,\ says Lee Bloomrosen, director of the College Center and organizer of the Bread and Puppet/Union partnership. \It is like having the opportunity to work with Shakespeare.\ One hundred people are needed for this opportunity from the college and the surrounding area. Workshops and rehearsals will be held for three weeks, concluding with performances of \Fly or Die\ running from Oct. 23-25. No acting or musical experience is necessary. All that is needed is an open mind and a willingness to have a great time. Musica Femina in Review by Carrie Sherman Arts Editor Last Monday night, Janna MacAuslan and Kristan Aspen perfonned a flute and guitar duo entitled \Musica Femina\. This concert was unique, because it was a combination of a co-ncert and a musical informational sessi()n. T~e duo performed onl~ mus1c composed by women. Before playing eacil piece they gave a brief history of the woman who wrote it. Tiley told us the womall's personal history, where she played and how widely regard«l she was in her time. MacAuslan and Aspen emphasized the research they did in order to find women's music that had been lost and doesn '·t normally appear in the history books. Many of the pieces they played were popular in tlieir time but are not heard todaY.. The music tb.ey played -~an&~d from Baroque to Modern. The composers dated back to 1587 and were from countries all over the world. Along with a wide range of countries and time periods there was a broad range of musical styles. In addition to this the group played some original compositions and each woman performed a solo. The concert not only featured beautiful music but was a good chance to learn about the history of W()men's music at the same time.

l l t CONCORDIEN$1S ., OCTOBER 1, 1992 • PAGE 15 Sideburns Crystal a Ia Carte Strikes Gold by Carrie S'llerman Arts Editor about the new \Auon Spelling\ teen-oriented shows that have recently emerged. \Beverly Hills 90210\ was the first of this type of show. This program is about a group of high-school seniors living in the Beverly Hills fast lane. \Melrose Place\ a spin-off of 90210, aired last summer. This show has a similar theme, but the characters are in their twenties and deal with more \real.Jife\ problems. Wednesday ,night at 8:00 I find by Thor Alexander Benander myself drawn to the T.V. Arts and Entertainment was the tiny role of Julie Warner (Doc Hollywood), who played Buddy's wife. A very talented actress, she played her part well, but her potential went largely untapped. Ron Silver (Reversal of Fortune) perfects a small role as a powerful Hollywood director. However. I am not alone. 1------------ In this day and age free entertainment is almost .unheard of. Movies are about $7. Even on-campus movies have doubled in price since I was a freshman (to- the very steep price of $2). Since the new alcohol policies have been instituted, going to the beloved fraternity basements is no longer a viable option. Venturing off campus to Schenectady bars could be an adventure, but this is also costly and is a problem for those of you who aren't 21. So, what are your options on a cold weekday night in Schenectady? Your television set! You probably take this gray box that tal:ks to you most of the day for granted. However, there are several new programs whicll are quite entertaining. There has been a lot of talk Some other new shows with related themes, a close knit group of friends bonding in a variety of environment~. are: The Heights, 2.oeo Malibu Road, and The Round Table. (Name an area in Beverly HiUs and there's probably a newly created show to .go along with it). You may be wondering why you should spend your time watching shows about rich high-school seniors. Well, I often ask myself the same question. I consider myself a reasonably educated person. yet for some reason every There are ~bout eight others who are crowded around my T.V. every Wednesday, anxiously waiting to see \if Dylan and Kelly will tell Brenda abo11t their summer affair.\ My roommate gave me one possible answer to the questfon why we watch this show: \Because they all lead more exciting lives than we do.\ Sad, b11t probably true. If you want to take a stab at one of these new Fox shows flip around 811d find a show you like. Don't be unsocial about this though. Watching alone is not nearly as entertaining as with a crowd. Invite seme friends over and see if you too don't get hooked. For more information on how to make 90210 (or another show like it) an integral part of your social life, call \Steve\ Fontana, \Andrea\ Malinsky, \Brenda\ Belsmger or \Donna\ Bilsky at 555-90210. .. · .

In his directorial debut, Crystal brings us the story of an ambitious Catskills comedian 1 who rises to television fame as I the host of his own comedy . hour. Unfortunately, Buddy's · style of humor has a tendency to turn nasty, and his career suffers accordingly. 011ce a famous comedian, he ends up booking gigs that are absolutely pathetic. Crystal fans will love it. He has a way of bringing the mortal, human side of every situation into focus, just like he did in When Harry Met Sally and City Slickers. Juggling comedy and emotion is no easy trick, but Crystal manages with class. The audience delves into the very soul of Buddy Young, Jr. and sees his life from a concerned perspective. Whether or not you like him, you find yourself rooting for him. David Paymer (Jacob's Ladder) is stellar as Buddy's older brother, and Helen Hunt (Project X) portrays a young New York Comic Agent with integrity. A disappointment Mr. Saturday Night is not a hit movie. It drags at times when the barrage of one-liners seems outdated and' stale. For Cry,stal fans, it is a must see, but for those who are looking for a strict comedy, don't look here. Mr. SaturdayNight does yuk it up from time to time, but interwoven through the jokes is a sad tale of shattered dreams and despair. I couldn't help seeing Buddy Young, Jr. as the Willy Loman of comedy. It has its moments, but the college audience might want to save the seven bucks and hang on till video time. Not Good •• Maybe.

Be more playful and lighten up. You may need some time off for rest and relax:a· tion this weekend. SCORPIO (October 23-November 21) Initiate some important talks. You are more grounded than you have been in a long time. Settle in and enjoy the chaos around you. Your more playful side emerges just in time for the weekend. SAGITTARIUS (November 22- December 21) Make the most of the peaceful times, because soon they will befew and far between. You hear news that is rather startling. The roller coaster ride you're on provides you many opportunities. CAPRICORN (December 22- January 19) You're on a roll (maybe), if you've been very careful dealing with funds. You can't have everything always, is the lesson of the full moon this week. You spend the weekend talking and getting to know another much better. AQUARIUS (January 20-February 18) Perhaps you've been trying not to say what is really on your mind. Well, it isn't going to continue that way as the full moon accentuates you and tltose you love. Be prepared to make up for any harsh words said this weekend. And count on another fact: it will cost you. PISCES (February 1~-March 20) First you think you llave it, and then you think you don't The proverbial roller coaster slows down early on in the weekend, when the moon beams you into a leadership role.

VIDEo FI::.!1 SERIES FALL TER.'! 1992 'llal: of Heaven (Manuel Gutierrez AragOn, Spain, 1986, 127 m~nu~es) !otag1cal and u,npr_edictable, this. filc 1 s story is a l~s~y .a~prec1at1on of the power, tenacity and n-ys~er:-es of women. A· cl~le.ctable fairy tale from ' b~~1nn1nq to e~d, th~ mov1e unfolds like a sly saga a.bout the socJ.~l r1se of a beautiful ambitious .p~asant younq woman. Celebrating female r~sourcefulness, the film is highly textured a~d visually splendid. W~men on the Verge of a Ne~ous Breakdown (Pedro Al·rn.odovar, Spain, 1988, xx minutes) T!:le film depicts the disparate passionate actions of PEp:a when her lover moves out. When the clis.consolate Pepa tosses a couple dozen downers into her- gaz.pacho cocktail, she triggers a plot device tfla. t ncochets happily through the film. Her lov·el:\' s wife, his exes, his son and all the g:ir1Eriends of the jilted !'epa--complete with ·heartaches of their own--come trekk:ing through her apa.r-tment until, by the encl, the film has lampooned eve;rr sort of TV soap, including laundry detergent co:unerc:ials. Almbddvar does not embellish ,the l:ORl.aDtic entanglements of the single woman, he en·lar-ges on romance as it appears in daytime TV a:l.ready a pathetic maqnification. ' Port,-ait of Teresa (Paster Vega, CUba, 1979, 103 ni.nutes) 'Til:.i's is one of the most cont:roversial movies yet fr-~m Cuba. Teresa is a. house!,iife and mother who wr:>rks in a textile factory. Her involvement in P<>•litical and cultural groups incurs the displeasure of hez husband. The resulting difficulty in their m~rriaqe is depicted with compassion and aQthenti~ity: Though center stage belongs to T~.:resa, l.t l.S the bond of sexual and emotional em~at~y bet~een her and her husband that gives the flln its intensity and anguish.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 1, 1992 • PAGE 18 By Steve Mooar contributing writer The Union College Crew Team is coming <>ff one of its best seasons in recent history.

The field lines, placed by Jenn \ Did I see you last night? \ V olz, showed the effort put forth the previous night by the host team. But finally with the help of some male ruggers the lines improved their somewhat crooked appearance. The Union team anticipated Hamilton, their last year's season opener defeat, to arrive for a 12 pm kick off. However it seems that Hamilton's strategy session also ran late and they arrived at a slightly later time.

This coming Monday night's matchup. however, will be their biggest challenge of the season. Both the Eagles and the Cow boys have realistic hopes of making the claim for the Lombardi trophy, and this game could be an early determiner. One couldn't ask for a better matchup: two undefeated teams in the NFL's toughest division, Randall versus Troy, and Herschel versus Emmitt. For Dallas to win, they will have to contain Herschel Walker, who would surely love to run the score up on his old team. Also, they will have to keep- Randall in the pocket, and :keep the ball out of the air, because when Randall leaves the pocket, it could spell V-I-C-T-0-R·Y for the Eagles. Philly, on the other hand will utilize the skills of their potent secondary (including Andre Waters) in attempting to keep the Dallas passing game on the ground. Then, there's Emmitt. Good luck, Philly (Hint: use Reggie White). MEN'S RUGBY FALLS TO Don't count out those Redsldns, either. Look for them to be a force In the upcoming weeks.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 1 , 1992 • ,PAGE 19 FOO'TBALL CONTINUES WINNING S'TREAK Courtesy of Associated Press Something has got to give' . this weekend when NCAA playoff-hopefuls Union and Dickinson meet in Pennsylvania this weekend. Union is 3-0 this season having beaten St. Lawrence, WPI, and Hobart. Dickonson is 3-0 as well, having beaten Georgetown in the final secondsto win by a score of 20-14. The Dutchmen have not lost a regular season game since the second contest of the 1990 season and go into the weekend with a 19 game regular season win streak. Dickinson has not lost a regular season home game since 1987, winning the last 25 straight. The Red Devils, who did drop 21-20 decision to visiting Susquehanna in the first rouJ:!Q of the NCAA playoffs last year, are 14-0-1 in their last 15 regular season outings. · The Devils like to run the ball and average 268 yards a game and 4.7 yards a play on the ground. The Dutchmen have always been known for their run defense and are giving up 107 yards ~ game and just 22 yards a play. On the other hand, Union is averaging 191 yards a game and 4.8 yards a play with its rushing attack while the Devils are giving up just 48 yards a game and 0..8 yards a play. Union's twin tailback of sophomore Chris Irving and junior Chad LaBan te spearhead the Dutchmen's ground attack. Irving has picked up 220 yards on 41 carries while LaBonte shows 189 on 40. Senior fullback .Dave Flynn has 131 yards on just 17 carries for a team high 7. 7 yards a carry. So far this year Union has shown it can throw the balL Junior quarterback Brian Harris is 37 .of 78 for 651 yards and 10 touchdowns with just three interceptions. Senior wideout Gene Ray leads the ·receiving corp with 263 yards on 12 catches. He also has five touchdowns. Classmate split end Jerry Walker is next with 111 yards on six receptions. Perhaps Union coach John Audino described this weekend's upcoming game between the Dutchmen and the Dickinson Devils best by saying .\This is what college football is all about, you've got two teams with NCAA background and playoff aspirations knocking heads. I thought we were a little flat last week against Hobart, especially offensively. but we'll be ready this week.

Ensuring the future for those who shape it!\ chach alk by John Schachnovsky Sports Editor That's right I am finally a senior. With this comes many things ... the added resP<Jnsibility of finding a job and 1he constant parental harassment :that goes along with that. Also it means my last year at the sports desk at the Concordiensis office ... THANK GOD!!.!! ! For the next couple of months I will try and give the Union Coll~ge community .a glimpse into the real world of professional and college sports. For _people who have never read one of my articles, it is smart to keep one thing in mind .. .I AM ALWAYS RIGHT!!!! Another thing that first time readei'S should know is, I do offend people and their ideas. The fact is. I try to weed . through the rhetoric and tell the ·truth, even if it is tough for some :people to take. This week I want to address all of the hubbub over \the girl\. I know you all know who I'm talking about, the girl goalie. I won't waste my time looking up how to spell her name because I don't think she desewes that much respect, and besides that it doesn't even matter for my purposes. She deserves to be in the NHL about as much as Peggy Fleming and Brian Boitano. I know what a lot of guys are thinking ... SHE'S CUTE. Great .. put her in the next SI swimsuit edition, but cute doesll't win hockey games. Coming into the Tampa Bay Lightning training camp her scouting report was less than average. It was said that when she leaves the crease to play ihe puck she looks like the Hartford Whalers in the play- offs ... LOST!!! Well last time I checked leaving the crease to play the puck was an intricate part of G-0-A-L-T-E-N-D-1-N- G!!! I wish Phil Esposito, General Manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning would jus-t admit that what he did was a cheap public relations stunt to try and get support for his new franchise. I would have no problem if everyone would just admit that all this freak is is a girl trying to play a man's sport...BECAUSE THAT IS ALL ITIS!!! For those of you, mostly female readers who are full of steam right about now, take a cold shower and face true facts. If you saw the highligllts of the pre-season game she played in you would not be as hot headed. She played a whopping twenty minutes of hockey and let in two shaky .. .I mean S-H-A-K-Y goals. Please though, don't take my word for it take into consideration the fans who gave her a standing ovation when she made a stop that was more routine than a Brett Hull slapshot. O'kay .. .if the fans are not good enough for you, how about a quick synopsis of a Sports Illustrated article about her. Good enough for high school...surc! Good enough for college ... never! Good enough for the pros ... HAH!!! I'll admit that one day many years from now (in a galaxy far far away) a female may be good enough for a possible ... maybe ... slight chance at a professional sport now dominated by men.

(!Lnltfllrbirttsis utchmen Continue Winning Ways by Dagan La Corte Associate Sports Editor Coming off a big come- from-behind-victory against WPI, the Dutchmen played host to the Statesmen of Hobart on Saturday. The Dutchmen have met with much success this season, both individually and as a team. As a result of last weeks performance, Senior receiver Gene Ray won E.C.A.C. Upstate New York Offensive player of the week. In that endeltvor: Ray had three touchdown receptions, and totaled 139-yards. Ray's honor marks the second straight week in which a Dutchmen player has received that award. In the first week of the season junior quarterback Brian Harris also won the award for his four- touchdown, 235-yard effort. The WPI gllffie, also served to extend Union's regular season winning streak to eighteen games. Hobart's squad is much improved over last years team, but they were no match for the Dutchmen. On the second play of the game, Harris connected with senior tight end Tim Bradford for a 28 yard gain, and put the Dutch men on the Hobart 18- yard line. Mter another pass to Bradford, and two runs by sophomore tailback Chris Irving, the Dutchmen had first and goal on the Statesmen seven-yard line. On the next play Harris again handed the ball· to Irving, and he ran it up the midd.le for a 6-0 lead. Kicker Greg Harrison extended the lead to 7-0 when he' succesfully kicked the extra point. Hobart made no real attempts to score, until, with three seconds left in the quarter, they kicked a 28-yard field goal. The quarter ended and Union's lead was cut to 7-3. The second quater was highlighted by a blocked punt by D11tchman defensive back Matt Schmitter, and later a 36- yard punt by sophomore Jason Baker, wbich was recovered by senior defensive back Chris Trevi~ani on Hobart's 1- yard line. With 1:22left in the half, Hoba:rt fumbled the ball on their own twenty, and Dutchman Marco Lainez was able to recover the ball for Union. With 31-seconds left in the i1alf, Greg Harrison succesfully kicked a 31-yard field £Oal to put the Dutchmen ahea<l.l 0-3. The Dutchmen started off the second half with a bang. Mter running the ball for a 17- yard gain, Statesman Chris Nordby fumbled the ball, and Dutchmen defensive end Jaimy Fam!lll recoverd it on Hobart's 49-yard line. On the ensuing possesion, the Dutchmen marched down the field, in search of a touchdown. The drive was highli£hted by a 27- yard run by tailback Chad La Bonte, and later a 23-yard touchdown pass by Harris t<> Tim Bradford, which put the Dutchmen ahead 17-3. Farnan's good day continued, and with 2:40 left ill the quarter, he intercepted a pass thrown by Statesme11~ quarterback Jim Marotta, an<l put the Dutchmen on Hobart\s 27 -yard line. Three plays later, Harris connected with Gene Rayon a 10-yard pass to make: the score 24-3. The fourth quarter held anticipation of things to come. Many of the younger players got into the game. Harris was replaced by sophomore quarter back Keith Lombardo; sophomore running back Mike Rauseo, and Freshman Frank Attah also got into the action. In the end it was a 24-3 Union Victory, and. the Dutchmen extended both their regular season, and home winning streaks to nineteen_ games. UNION AT DICKINSON ON SATURDAY 10/3 1:30PM Tampa Bay Bucs Super Bowl Bound? by !Rich Morgan ASS',(}Ciate Sports Editor Pic1t11te this scenario: If the NFL season were to end this week, two of the NFC's playoff teams would be (drum roll, please). . . the Minnesota Vikings and the Tampa Bay B11ccaneers (This is not a test)! I Obviously, this a very premature statistic, but with the way Vinny Testaverde has been throwing the football (the Buccaneers are a perfect 3-0 with him at the helm), things are ltOoking up early for the team from Tampa Bay. But don't count your chickens just yet: uhey still have two games each against their tough divisional rivals (the Bears and the Lions), plus an away game late no the season versus the surging San Francisco 49ers. There's still a long way to go .. Enough dreaming-let's face reality. Since the only team wortlly enough from the AFC to compete in the Super Bowl appears to be the Bills (although next week's showdown against the undefeated Miami Dolphins should prove to be a real shootout), most of the hype will focus around NFC representative to the Big Game. For the 49ers, only their bad start early last season prevented them from making the playoffs. They ended the . seaso0n with a six game winning streak, and have started off this season with a modest record of 3-1 (their only loss, coincidentally, came agai11st the Bills). Why are the Niners such a potent team, you might ask? In a word, depth. · This team is deeper that the middle of the Pacific Ocean-at 1 leas1 from an offensive 1 standpoint. Their number one ! quarterback (Montana), who is arguably the best to ever throw the ball, is out for another three weelcs. The team's \backup Steve Young, is currently one of the top ranked passers in the league. On top of that, their \thir.d-string\ QB, Steve Bono, is 4-1 as a statler for the 49ers (Help me, I'm drowning!). O.K., enough about their passers. Now .. moving on to their receive-rs: everyone knows Jerry Rice is probably the best receiver in the game today, but orte can't forget abollt John Taylor. Oh, but wait! Taylor broke his leg two weeks ago, didn't lle? Oh well, it seems the 49:ers will have to go to yet another backup, Mike Sherrard, tile Cowboys' number one draft pick several years ago, and one of the fastest in the game today. Hell, they might as well just throw the ball t<> th.eir fullback, Tom Rathman, another Pro Bowl possibility. This team is chock-full-of d-epth and talent, and will surely- be in the thick of the playoff ltunt-if they don't finish on top, tllat is. Next, there is the NFC East, which is by far the most cornpetetive division in the NFL. This division has put a team in the Super Bowl (and won them) four times in the last seven years, and this year may yeild similar results. As far as the Dallas Cowboys are concerned, tlley have gone from a 1-15 season in 1989 to an 11-5 seas()n last year, including a playoff victory in Chicago. They have the NFL rushing and receiving leaders in Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin, as well as their highly rated quarterback, Troy Aikman. So, you think the 49ers have depth? Well, when Aikman was injured last season, backup QB Steve Buerlein came in and proceeded to win the next five games in succession. Not bad for a backup. On the receiving end. they have speedsters Alexander Wright and Alvin Halper to help out Irvin (just in case he gets tired). The road to the Super Bowl won't be easy, to say the least, but they have stal'ted the season on the right foot. They defeated the Super Bowl Champion Washington Redskins on the first Monday night of the season, and have surged to a quick 3-0 start, and are ranked third in the league

Students to Receive New Social Outlet Abrams began his speech by imfonning the audience that the environmental movement J in New York State \is alive and weli.\ According to Abrams, citizen action groups are now able to work in alliance with the Attorney General in order to achieve their goals. Abrams, when he took over the office, appointed ~a toxic specialist from the NRDC to ens11re that citizens will be protected from private industries. Abrams described how his office has sued polluters in botlt criiilinal and civil courts. Prior to 1982, New York State had never sued a polluter. Over the past ten years the state bas collected over $300 million from polluters convicted in civil courts. Additionally Abrams proposed to the state legislature a felony statute that could hold polluters criminally reS)lOnsible if they jeopardized the welfare of citizens through reckless endangerment. After the statute was passed, the Attorney General's office made over two hundred criminal convictions. As Attorney General, Abrams promoted the passage of the Acid Rain Control Act, the frrst such act in New York State history. According to Abrams, a stricter Clean Air Act was passed, as well as a ·taw to prevent pesticide abuse. In addition, the state has cracked down on companies that falsely advertise their prcducts as being 'environ- mentally correct.'

Abrams attacked D 'amato for \not taking a leadership role ... and not articulating what needs to be done for the nation.\ Abrams called this a \disgrace.\ Abrams used D\ Amato's vote on a bill that was presented as a result of the Exxon Valdez disaster as an example. A bill was proposed that would have required oil companies to use double- hulled tankers. D' Amato voted against the bill. Accordin~ to Abrams, D' Amato was protecting the oil industries while \voting against the public interest\'. The speaker then discussed the programs he would attempt tc implement if he were elected. He would attempt to deal in a pragmatic way with the solid waste crisis. Abrams feels that one of the problems encountered wllen trying to create a recycling factory is the small market for the recycled goods.

We decided that our best bet was to focus on creating more social activities for the student body. A 1potential plan we came up with was to move Chet's to Fero House (old Beta House) which will have food , video games, entertainment, : and pool tables -- to finally create a true student activity center.

President Hull will be in attendance.) by Veronica Rogers News Staff In te<lay's society there are many issues that can greatly affect students of college age, or younger. Famous phrases like \it couldn't happen to me.\ \I don't have a drinking problem,\ \everyone's doing it\ or \I'm so fat\ .. come to mind as ways to excuse a lot of their behaviors. Union college senses this and in an attempt to make the issues more realistic to students, they have planned a number of events for this week and the upcoming week. Union decided to make it a two week awareness program, with meetings and speakers on subjects including eating disorders. to alcoholism to AIDS. Tonight brings the close of alcohol awareness week with a guest speaker from Alcoholics Anonymous who will be speaking at 8 p.m. at the College Center. Next week is the AIDS awareness/Changing Behaviors: Students at Risk series. It is strongly encouraged that all students come, even if they think they are in the \it couldn't happen to me\ category. TJ_le series of discussions and speakers are focusing not only on AIDS, but on homophobia, safe sex, and a greater understanding of risky behavior. The planned speakers will not be there to preach at the students, but rather to be a source of information that hopefully the students hopefully will be able to relate to. In attempts to \hit home\ with the students, some of the planned speakers are people who are HIV positive. There will be a student with AIDS speaking at a breakfast at 7:30 a.m. on Monday the 19th. This is the only event with admission cost, but it is hoped by the planners that it will be worth it to hear a personal perspective from a teenager. Some of the events are off campus, as this series i.s not only for Union College but for the Schenectady community as well. On Thursday the 22nd at 11:30 a.m. at the Schenectady County Community College there will be a discussion with people who are living with mv. On Wednesday the 21st at 6:30 pm there will be a panel discussion on Homophobia, a topic that the organizers feel needs to be addressed on this campus. Often heard around campus is \I am not homophobic\ but soon thereafter gay bashing can be heard in conversations. Attending and participating in events that discuss homophobia is a way to learn, and attempt to get rid of the stigmas that exist. In case there are questions or a lack of understanding about how risky students' behaviors can be, there will be a discussion on the subject of risky behavior on Thursday the 22nd, at 7 pm. It is for people who don't feel that they have a full understanding of risky behavior, but it is also for the people who are convinced that 1) they know all there is to know and 2) they could never be at risk because it couldn't happen to them. People might be surprised to learn that even if they are pretty careful they , are still at risk, and therefore must be informed on how to be completely protected. Possibly the most important event of the week is Friday the 23rd, at 8 p.m. in Memorial Chapel. The co'lledienne Suzi Landolphi will be giving a free· show. She is well known as a performer and an AIDS educator. She travels to college campuses around the country to educate students in a. performance of \audience participation, comedy, and drama.\ Her \Hot Sexy, and Safe\ program promotes understanding and learning of safe sex and also a further understanding of · the importance of trust, honesty. and communication in these days when a lack of communication can be deadly.

Did you know that 95-~8'% of dieters Fegain the weight they lost? Did you· lmow that models atld actresses hold .the second bigllest suicide rate in our country? Susan Kooo. author of the self-help book Mate Peace With Food, spoke to Union students on October 5 about the datigers of dieting. As a junior in college, Kano was a yo-yo dieter and borderline anore~ic. Her approach to dieting encompasses physical, psychological, and sociological factors. According to Kano there are two types of of diets: sensible (doctor-prescribed. low.- • • • calorie) and non-sensible win neither gain nor lose (liquid diets, pill diets). Diets weight. The diet now becomes don't work because they me a maintenance diet, working to based on faulty understanding :keep the person going.

When people A body's set point weight is diet, their bodies must adjust. based on Jteredity and lifestyle. to smaller amounts of food_ Ufestyle factors include the Body metabolism becomes amount of exercise obtained, lower and the body becomes ud the kinds of food eaten. set for starvation.

By changing the amount of food, one is simply losing protein, lean body mass, and fat body mass. When one regains weight, it will return as fat mass. The set-point theory consists of two-points: 1) a body will always fight to maintain its' set-point weight, and 2) many want to be thinner than their lowest set point weight. Those who fall into the .second category and lose weight will experience the following symptoms: insatiability (constant hunger), cravings for rich foods, obsession with food. depression, decreased sexual desire, intolerance of cold .temperatures, and apathy. Under weight and underfed people often binge. All dieters will experience insatiability because it is an automatic response to being below set point weight Cont. from page 1 fut:uls for super-funds, and for allowing oil companies to drill in areas where the drilling coul4 lead to ecological disasters. In addition, federal agencies, sllould not be exempt from being sued when they violate environmental laws, believes Abrams. From the international perspective. Abrams argued that the President ood the federal ~overnment were not doing er10ugh to save .the environment. At the Rio Conference, tile United States did n()t sign a treaty that was aimed at keeping emissions at the 199() level. It was also argued that the United States has not d'One enough to deal with 'Gl-obal Warming'. The • United States, according to · Abrams, slto11ld have taken the . lead in estabHshillg 45 miles- per-gallon as the minimum . standard for all automobiles · produced. The federal government has not taken an active role in promoting the use of solar lllld wind energy. Abrams also criticized President Bush for creating the myth that cleaning up the environment will cost jobs. The Attorney General cited Japan and Germany as countries that have used environmental cleanups to create jobs. :§ Joanne Tobiesse11 of the Career Development Center at Career Festival Oct. lst. Dieting affects the way people think and eat. It often leads to billging and bunched up eating (skipping meals and then overcompensating). Dieters often think in terms of good and bad. They often punish themselves with verbal abuse. Instead of asking should I or shouldn't I, Kano suggests they ask Am I hungry? or Am I not? In order to overcome obsessions with weight and dieting one must think and eat like a non-dieter, indulge in a healthy lifestyle, and accept ones set point weight. All people must consider themselves worthy and build up their self-esteem . People are beautiful, it is only a matter of letting it show. The remainder of the speech discussed other important issues in the 1992 campaign. Abrams attacked D'amato for being a member of the Right to Life Party. stating that women \have the right to choose.\ Abrams discussed the importance of education and how only one-fifth of the students eligible for Homestead grants actually get them. Students need to be given the opportunity to go to college because the country needs \tllose young people who have opportunity to bloom,\ according to Abrams. Abrams 'parting shot' at the federal government was to accuse them of allowing the ozone hole to have grown to three times the size of the United States.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 8, 1992 • PAGE 5 A T . I me For Debate by Jim Polites News Analysis Edit()r This past Tuesday marks just four weeks until Electio(Jn Day- so from now until Nc!Vember headlines will be filled with reports of fierce campaigning, scathing rhetoric, and .cllaracter assaults. Highlighting the three-pronged ·dual l)etween · incumbent George Bush, Democrat contender Bill Clinton, and last millute re- entry Ross Perot will' be a series of debates over the next .,_ week or so that will give the entire nation an opportullity to solidify (or question) their choice. The schedule is as follows: October 11 in St. Louis, October 15 in Richm(!)m<l, and October 19 in East Lalndsing, Michigan. In case you thought the Vice-Presidential n()minees were being forgotten, their prime time clash will be on October 13 in Atlanta. Of course, most of tile press attention surrounding. the debates this year have focused on PFesident Bush's and Bill Clinton's squabble over the deblhte fermat- something that has lidded some spice and specl!lat.ion to the upcoming festivities. The prevailing tension; along with the presence ~f Ross Perot could stir some controversy that wil·l mak€: the debates live up to their ,lofty billing as election high poillts. Fi!'g:~t of all, there are questions as to the degree of influence Perot will exert For a long time now, Bush and Clint~ll llave been firing shots at o11e another exclusively- it will be interesting to see whetl!er or not they .afford the inde!Jendent:a chance to join in the J)attle. That's not to say Mr. Perot won't be given equal opportunity to speak (he will, of C()JUse). I simply wonder wheth~r or not the two leaders will -want to waste valuable public exposure on an indivi<lual polling just 10% these ,days. By the same token, Perot could decide that ganging up on one of the other candidates will best suit his purposes. On the debate platform, he has the luxury to witness the flow of proceedings and then inject his own voice. Sometllillg to keep in mind is that Perot has been outspoken in his criticism about the job George Bush has done as President- it was one of the major reasons he joined the race in the first place. Thus don't be surprised to witness a 1 two-on-one situation for the simple reason that there will be only one man whose record as President of the United States will be up for scrutiny. Of course, both Clinton and Bush will come in to the debates with specific plans and goals as well. For the Democratic challenger, who has enjoyed a .comfortable lead since his party's convention, the plan is to continue on his victory march. Clinton must once and for all erase any doubts of a dubious background. but be can . accomplish this simply by coming across as all honest advocate for change. It's obvious that the majority of people in this country find his character less and less troubling, so barring any major gaffes the Arkansas governor shouldn't be hurt at all in the debates. Conversely, the predicament of George Bush is much more serious. Much like what was being asked of him at the Republic an National Convention in Houston is cropping up again. He unlike Clinton must change the minds of the electorate, and this is the last (and only) opportunity he will have to be face to face ·' with Clinton and appeal to the masses. While the Democrat's standing in the polls dropped a few points with tbe return of Ross Perot. Mr. Bush didn't budge (about 35%). There's no doubt that he must be extraordinarily convincing and inspiring over this pivotal week and a half, something that many believe is asking too much. As a final note. don't discard the VP debates as insignificant for if nothing else they've provided great theater and some very memorable moments. l remember in 1984 when Geraldine Ferraro asked then- Vice President George Bush to kindly stop patronizing her. Of course, who can forget 1988, when an overmatched Dan Quayle persisted in comparing his record to that of John Kennedy? It was the consummate example of experience (that of Lloyd Bensten} conquering youth. Factoring in the earnestness of George Bush, volatility of Ross Perot, and confidence of the Clinton/Gore tandem should make for an exciting time leading up to November 3. If anything significant is going to change, it will happen with all the major players standing across from one another on the same stage in 'font of millions of Americans. That- no doubt- is the way it should be. Read My Lips - No More Jobs by Daimee Stadler a11d Rachel Katz Contributing Writers Have many of you asked yourselves the questio11,'\Why am I attending Union College?\ Sure, the initial response might be to S)Jend the next four years partyi11g,. but realistically the unde=rtying reason is to obtain an edacation tllat will prepare you for the competitive job market and a successful ftiture. Unfortunately. the outlook is not promising. When asked the qu:·estion,\What do you want to l>e when you grow up,\ .tile new answer sllould be a full-life college student. Under the Bush Admillistration, the number of jobs ill' the U.S. has grown by less tllan l%, the lowest rate of growt.IJ since World War 2. If Bush is elected for a second term, will he be able to impT()v-e the job market? Considering his ineffectiveness in lifting us out of the recessi()on mtd broken campaign pledge not to raise taxes. is this man worthy of a second chance? On the other ha11d, Bill Clinton's proposals will establish eight milli()n new jobs over the next four years. In fact in Clinton's home state of .Aikansas, the employment rate from January 1989 to July 1992 has increased by 11.8% . Likewise, the unemployment rate decreased during the same time from 7.6% t() 7.1 %. Clinton will also develop a defense conversion plan to ensure that the communities and talents of millions of workers who helped win the Cold War will not be left out in the cold. It appears that Clinton's past record as governor is quite impressive and his agenda for the United States (if elected) does offer hope for the country. Bill Clinton is greatly in favor of a strong job training program to be established. which is essential if U.S. citizens wish to obtain jobs. In addition, Mr. Clinton would require companies to set aside 1.5% of their payrolls for worker training or pay a CJ c o c:J c c l:::l o CJ t:l o c c:::J o c:::J c:J r:::J o t:;l c c o c o CJ c:::J c c c c c o c c:::J t:=l Cl c:::J o o c c 0' o ·by Jeff Green= o c comparable amount to a government fund that would pay for the training. In the end, the true test in job creation comes down to · h.ow well the economy does. No one really kn'ows whether George Bush or Bill Clinton is the better candidate. At least we have a fighting chance with Governor Clinton, though. Clinton offers this country l!ope for a brighter future which is something Bush cannot provide.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER S, 1992 • Rll You Wanted to Know About Uitamins by Bruno Benzaquen contributing writer Vitamms are nutnents required in small amounts to ensure growth and maintain health . Vitamin deficiencies manifest tllemselves by well characterized illnesses. The position of most nutritionists is that a well balanced diet should provide all the necessary vitamins thus making it a wa~te of money to buy vitamin supplements. History 'Bas taught us the importance of vitamins in our diet, in the early voyages of discovery, scurvy a lethal condition associated with a vitamin C deficiency, decimated whole crews at sea. It was believed initially that it was H1e acidic taste that · prevented scurvy, as a result in subsequent voyages some sailors were fed dilute amount s of sulf1uic acid with, surprise .. s11rprise, disastrous effects. The early discovered vitamins belonged to the amine class of organic compounds, hence the term \vitamin.\ This term was first coined by the Polish scientist Casimir Funk as an abbreviation of \vital amine\. There is a current controversy that rages p1esently in the US. on vitamins. Vitamin believers claim that in large amounts, vitamins provide prevention and cures for a variety of diseases such as the common cold, cancer, heart diseases, etc .. According to such people the daily allowance of vitamin C should be more than 150 times the recommended daily allowance value (R.D.A.) . Many of these so called nutritional scientists require a hair analysis to detect any vitamin or mineral deficiencies. At an average cost of 50$. this procedure is totally useless for this purpose. Vitamins are not found in hair and there is not a proven relationship between the 'hair's minerals and the nutritional balance in the body. Vitamin C or ascorbic acid, is the best known of the vitamins, every body knows that if we have a cold we should drink lots of orange juice. A vitamin C deficiency would result in symptoms of scurvy, such as internal bleeding and the falling out of teeth. Rigorous studies on vitamin C have revealed that there is no connection between consuming large doses of vitamin C and the or the cure of the common cold. S()me alleviation of symptoms m~ght be present but this is belie-ved to be true only because vitamin C has a slight antihistamine effect. However, vitamin C may be useful in the prevention of cancer. It also prevents ·the conversion of the natur~lly occurring nitrates and nitrites to the class of carcinogellic compound's known as nitrosamines. Because nitrites are used as preservatives in dte meat industry , vitamin C is now added to hot dogs md sausages to prevent the formation of the harmful chemicals. What happenec:!i to the days were we could eat a hot dog and not a chemical factory?! In large d.oses, vitarnill.

, OCTOBER 6, 1992 • PAGE 7 DOE Offers Research Programs , coul'tesy of Donna Prokop If you are a sophomore, junior, or senior studying computer science, engineering, physics, environmental and life sciences, mathematics Science and Engineerin·g Research Semester, SERS, offers you a unique opportunity to do hands-on research with some of the nation's top scientists at one of seven national research laboratories during the academic year. The U.S. Department of Energy, DOE, is spcnsoring the program to encourage undergraduate students to continue their studies in science and engineering. About 400 students annually receive SERS appointments at one of the participating laboratories. These laboratories include Argonne, located outside Chicago; Brookhaven, on Long Island, N.Y.; Lawrence Betkeley, ne~ San Fransico; Lawrence Livermore, at Livetmore, California; Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, located in Tennessee; and Pacific Northwest, in Washington State. Participants become members of research teams engaged in long-range, intensive investigations at these outstanding facilities.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 8, 199:2 • PAGE 8 Adjustable Rate Mortgages Explained MoneY and the Market by Shields D~ay Bu$iness Editor The past few years have certainly not been. gooo ones for the United States· ec()nomy. It all started innocently enough as the government attempted a simple slowing down. of U.S. inflation. However~ actions taken by the Federal Reserve turned into an actual recession - almost unthinkable during the prosperous 1980's. As the third quarter of the year rolls around, the United States economy is held back by its previously unsuccessful recoveries. Indicators sb()wing that even a change of '!)()litical parties may not give mttch of a boost to the sluggish economy. Despite this depressing news there actually is a positive side - inflation has loweted and interest rates have <lr()pped. What good does this dD? The decrease in interest rates have led to a huge surge in debt refinancing. Basically, this means that homes m~rtgage owners can pay off large amounts of their mort1:)ages at much lower rates than tlley had bargained for originally. This is due mainly to the introduction of ARMs - Adjustable Rate Mortgages. ARMs are a recent innovation to the fitlancial system first approve~ by the federal g()vernment in 1981 and are quickly gaining popularity. ARMs are appealing to home- buyers because they offer a lower interest rate than the traditional fixed-rate mortgage. How <lo ARMs work? ARMs can offer a lower interest rate because the purchaser of the loan must assume som.e of the risk. If interest rates increase then the owner of 1he mortgage must pay :the current' interest 'tate instead of the one be originally had when ,the mortgage was first purchased. However, there is .a limit on how high an increase the consumer must pay. For example, most ARMs state that the owner of the mortgage will never pay an increase of rnore than 2% over a one year period. Also the consumer will never have to pay more than 5% over the initial interest rate. If an Adjustable Rate Mortgage is purchased at the rate assigned to a 6 - month treasury bill, the owner of that mortgage will pay off his loan at whatever the current rate for 6-month T -bills happens to be residing. All holders of these ARMs will use the 6-month rate as their personal index. If the rate rises 1%, tile consumer will .then pay their nex.t payment at a 1% increase from the previous payment. Before the introduction of ARMs, when interest rates were high, many home-buyeFs were unable to qualify for a home m()rtgage. With the introduction of ARMs. consumers are no longer forced to accept the fixed rate banks offer to home buyers. Now. consumers can choose rates that begin with lower initial rates, making qualification for a home loan easier. Despite the fact that the United States is in a seemingly inescapable recession, there are some side effects that prove to be beneficial to many people. Currently. owners of ARMs (at least those who are employed) are able to pay off large portions of their mortgages at extremely low rates. Certainly rates will rise again, but for now, many people are taking advantage of this opportunity to shorten tile time they have to wait until they own · their , biggest asset outright - their home. Write for Business a1ztl Finance CROSSTALK WED. OCTOBER 14 7:00 PM COLLEGE CENTER AUDITORIUM by Gary Chase Business Staff This past week has been another roller (;()aster ride for investors in the marketplace. After the previous Friday•s selloff, Monday's market was cautious; prices held firm and trading was sluggish. The end of the day brought a 26 point surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average as investors decided that stock prices would remain solid. The price of the thirty year treasury bond, the benchmark for the bond market, gained 1/4 point. Two significant economic indicators were revealed on Tuesday morning. According to the conference board. consumer confidence fell .2% in August and reached its lowest level this close to a presidential election in two decades. The index of leading indicators, which helps to predict economic conditions in the longer tenn, unexpectedly fell .2%. Apparently, the dominant sentiment was that tht? market had already pushed prices low enough. Prices remained relatively constant. The dow posted a 9 point gain and the treasury lost 1/4 point. Wedne~day brought a certain tranquility to the market With Friday's unemployment report 'for September expected to be disappointing, traders began to speculate as to whether or not the U.S. Federal Reserve would move again to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. Sentiment also grew that Germany's Bundesbank would succumb to political pressures and move to cut its key lending rates. The Dow rose a mere 5 points and the treasury fell 1/4 point. Thursday's market dropped 17 1/2 points on weak news in \HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE 'NEW' SOCIAL POLICY?\ COME AND VOICE YOUR OPINION! An Open Discussion with Students, Faculty, the Administration the manufacturin~ sector. New orders for manufactuted goods fell and construction spending fell1.1% in August. Also, the National Asscdation .of Purchasing Management's September index fell to 49% (Readings below 50Lfo indicate weakness in industry). the bond market raUied in anticipation of an~>tller rare cut by the Fed. The treasury gained 3/4 point. Friday's unempl()yment report was a little ootter than expected and acrnally showed modest improvement. However, investors found little comfort as the improvement was attributed to a coiJtraction of the labor force rather than an increase in the nll1llber of jobs. The report on August factory orders was also released showing a 1.9% decline. These developments led the stock market to a 54 point decline. The poor economic news failed to spark a rally in the bond market. The treasury finished the day with a 1/4 point loss. Even though we still have about a month between now and the election, it appears more and more likely that Clinton will win.. A survey conducted and published in last week's Concordy 'by the famous pollster Jeff Green shows that Clint()n is favored by a considerable margin. According to the survey, that margin is even greater n.ow that Perot has decided to rejoin the race. Personally, 1 think that's bad news, but I'll leave the political analysis to my more able colleague Jim Polites. However, I am concerned with the impact that a Clint()n win would have on the madet. No one has seen :Bill Clinton in action, and no one knows what effect his policies will have ()D stock and bo11d· prices. Traditionally, b111l markets nave existed und~r Republican administrations and Democratic administrations are credited with fostering bear markets. (A bull market is one where prices are rising whereas a bear market is one where prices are declining) Over the ]last four years the stock muket has flourished under President Bush. Wall Street wou.ld surely feel more ecmfortable with his reelection, but the growing possibility ()f a Clinton victory is making investors insecure about tile stability of prices. In times like the~e when the world economy is ill soch a poor state, the ma1ket is very sensitive and reactiOJlW'Y. The uncertainty surrounding the election is augmenting the problem and certainly contributed to the d~lille we've seen in the market this week. Prices may be subject to further downward pressiJl'e, but it is doubtful that an.J major advances will .occllf until after November.

Schumann stressed th:at the outdoor pageant will not be a play. but more like a lcose choreography. It will take 500 people to accomplisll the complete affect of the environmental tlleme. Schumann told the cast that they will act like cheerleaders for the audience because the audience will be .needed to participate. Schumann says the ~how \Fly or Die\ will take the moment in which we live right now and analyze it. The cast will then take all the bad things about this moment and turn them into physical words.

From the office of Editor-in-Chief, to that of staff writer. duties have been shuffled around, new offices created, and old positions have merged to make our team a unified group of students. We feel that the changes we have u.ndergone will make this paper more able to serve· the colleg~ community as a source of news and a hub of communicatioll. To properly represent all that Ius happened s~nce last spring, we are slowly introducing a new image. This can be observed throughout the paper. We have created a new headline combining the symbols of Union College and Union University. We have re-4esigned the editroial page so that it resembles one found in any mainstream newspaper. We have restored the Campus News and the Campus Bulletin Board Sections in order that they provide the community with a majority of events to happen eac·b. week. And, of course, we are always open to suggestions. have cha~ged. Rather, the deans suggest that they a.:r:e merely enforcing policies · which have been in effect for a number of recent years. I have · no .problems with what 'the deans, who are apparently acting in response to increasing faculty pressures, are trying to accomplish. I do, however, question the way in which the vv•A\'A'\\ are· contributing to the social life at Union. The newly enforced policies are detrimental to the overall well being of the institution. In the past, Union students have had the luxury of a safe and convenient social life. The campus is very much self contained and students are for the most part sheltered from the \outsiders\. Furthermore, security provides rides to students as they roam around the ~campus. I am starting to see a new trend in students behaviors. They are starting to have to seek alternative ·off campus entertainment under the new system of enforcement. Please don't get me wrong. I am not s~wing that fraternities are the last word in Union college social life; and by closing houses during the week. there is no social life at all. It has been my experience, however. that fraternities do play a maJor role in the Union College social life. College students enjoy going out and socializing with their .friends. This is an essential part of the en tire college experience. I feel that by forcing students off campus there is an increased risk of drunk driving related accident, and/or assaults on students by non-students. Yet another area that I will address is the affect that the new system is having on Residence Life. Students are drinking more in the dorms. and not su:rprisingly, · these areas are suffering the increased ''wear and tear\ by frustrated/inebriated college students. As for viable solutions to this issue I would suggest that the frllternHies possibly be permitted to regi$ter a party one nigllt Ollt of the academic week. rOr you could go to Chet' s and enjoy a cold one with 800 or sc of your closest 21 year old Union friends. I would like oo see the social policy reeval11ated. I hope it will not take a student injury, or even W()lrse. a student death in order for these policies to be addressed. Sincerely Ian Prout '()4 WWF SAVE THE WILDLIFE WORLD WILDLIFE FEDERATION Our newest addition is the h.eadline that includes both symbols of Union. The symbol' of the University is ?n t~e left, and is surrounded by an oumbouros (the snalce eatmg Its tail, representing infiniti), and the familiar symbol of t~e College is on the right. The name Universitas Conc~re literally means University of Conc<Jrd, or, as we say, Umon University. That should help some people understand the title of our newspaper. ME MAN, YOU WOMAN There have been many other hUiciles to clear, begining with the implementation of a computer ~:ystem. This me~t that we had to start doing all layout design and paste-up m order to send a photo-ready product to tile printer. This process has taken only five issues fot us to fully implement, wheras, it has talcen most college papers at least one year. We also faced budget cuts from the school,. and as a result, restructured our entire advertising department ill ocder to increase income. I am informing the entire community of our recent history in order that they understand that c:h31lges that have occured. I also offer an apology if there have been any miscommunications with the paper since last spring. However a new Concordiensis is emerging, and since we are· ' . the newspaper of this college, we want to help you 1? any way we can.

I ventured out with a friend. and landed at what could be termed a party. After overcoming a room full .of people I didn't even recognize (sometimes I wonder if I evelt go here) I found a familiar face. Let me begin by saying the apathetic response to my initial article on sexism, has caused me to accost people in the hopes of gaining some idea. on how it was received. Thos, when I ran into this particular 1------------------------a fellow, whose views r11n alarmingly to the right of the. political spectrum, I eagerly awaited his response. What he said has inspired this columm, and I tllank him ·for his thoughts, regardless of what I believe tD be true.

He claims to be old fashioned, he is looking for a \traditional wife n one whom he can shelter from the evils of the world. As he continued his monolog11e, I watched my friend's eyes bulge out of her head in disbelief. At the time I tried to co11vince myself that he alone shared these outmoded views. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that some small piece of that view underlies the thoughts of many men, I have encountered, they just don't say it so vociferously. I believe that we all share the impulse to shelter those we love, to somehow shield them from pain. But I also believe that to imply fuat we as women need protection, because we are women, is just inappropriate. The world is scary, even scarier living as a woman, never feeling completely comfortable with a~y guy you meet, no matter how wonderful he appears; not. oeing able tD walk alone, even when you need the time tu yourself, locking the car doors as you drive to even tiJ.e simplest errand. Is he prepared to become her shadow'! It's just impossible, there is no way to keep evil out. And if you manage, the risks grow even larger. The answer is in :knowledge, knowing how to protect yourself, and not depending on anyone else to do it for you. Under his code of ethics, the woman might as well dwell in a cave, and I, for one, can't help believ-ing that his urge to \protect\ :is really an urge to dominate. After all, by keeping her sheltered and ill equip)led to deal with! reality, he remains firmly in c:harge. This is the legacy of a patriarchal society, tile \Me man, :you woman\ theory which implies a sellse of separateness that 11Himates serves no one. I don't claim to kn()W the answers, I do claim t!O try to bring light to the pmblem. Right now. some guy i.s saying to himself, \Hey this j&n~t me\ but think about it, lit some point, in some small way, you have been. A pat~iarchal society dictates this ;ts fact. Union is no exception. Needing to protect or shelter women. because of some ingrained -societal inferiority complex is wrong, mt~ting to protect someone beca11se you care about them, regardess of gender, ·men looking out for each other .. women looking out for each. other and themselves, and VICE VERSA, is the beginning of eq 11ality. Domination by default is no victory. It's not eveiJ a fair contest.

CON~ORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 8. 1992 • PAGE 11 lnc:idents Not a Laughing To the Editor: I am the RA on third floor Fox South, which is the floor where three of .the f()ur women · who have been assa:ulted live. The incidents in wllicb Ms. ONeil was referring to in her article 'Who's Afraid efthe Big Bad Snuggler?', C>011sist of a man entering the moms of women, waking th<lm 11p, and in some cases tou(hing them sexually. Fr,om the time the incidents were reported Security, the entire Residents Life staff, and I have devoted the majority of our spare time 011 the case. Ther(fore, with Security's permissioo, I can report that none of the 'facts' that Ms. O'Neil has stated are true. For Ms. O'Neil to question whether the man entered via a master key or through unlocked doors is outlandish. The fact that the intruder entered through unlocked doors was one of tpe first things that Security knew. There have already been rumors circulating the campus that stated that there was a rapist on ·Campus with a master key, or that it was an RA. Ms. O'Neil, are you trying to get ·those rumors started again? I should hope not. With ~espect to the Concordtensis, in a case of such dire importance, it is the responsibility of the paper to report the facts to the college community. The article that you printed did not do this. The warning that you squeezed in on pa1Je 2 in microscopic print, did. It is also the paper's responsibi f.ity to make sure that the i11formation they are printing has come from reliable sources, not from a best friend who hapJlens to live on the floor. Tile article that was printed tr~ts the subject matter sarcastically, and has offended not only 111yself, but all tllose who have been involved. The women who were attacked went througli enough already, what they do not need is the newspaper belittling the incident. And, Ms. O'Neil, if you don't that that this case is serious, why are there Security officers roaming Fox until 5 am on weekends? Why has there been letter after letter to the campus about safety and locking doors whenever you leave? Why do you tllink it is so difficult to get into buildings now? Why are all women's suites in Fox and Davidson receiving locks on their i11ner doors? And why. Ms O'Neil. have I had to comfort women almost every night for a week because they were unable to sleep at night, even with their doors locked? Perhaps if you, or the paper. would have investigated tile case, you would know the answers to these questions. I would like to apologize to the women on my floor who have been offended by the article and commend Security for tile fine job they have been doing on the case. To Conoordiensis: I sincerely hope that the next time you print a Feature article, you wi 11 consider what is written in it and flow it will impact tbe camplls.

( 201 ) 305-5'950 To the Editor: Jewish students at Union ColleBe who choose to observe the High Holidays find the policy regarding scheduled classes on religious holidays here a bit insensitive. Many teachers have scheduled mid- tenn examinations on Friday October 9, and are therefore giving review classes on Wednesday October 7. Since this is the traditional day to observe Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. many Jewish students will miss these required class days. Not only does this put us at a disadvantage academically, but it completely disregards our right to observe our faith. This also puts observing students in an awkward positioJt. Yom Kippur is the day of repentance, and for observing Jews it would be sacrilegious not to go to services. Do we observe the most important holy day of the year. or do we go to classes for fear of receiving a lower grade on a rn id-term? We are not asking for all classes to be cancelled. We realize that is a bit unreasonable. We are aski11g that the faculty at tllis institution be a little m()re reas()nable with their schedtding policies. First of all. vrofessors should offer alternate review sessions for the Jewish students. Secondly. they sllould be more reasonable with their attendance policies during the Jewish holidays. The students at Union College should not have to choose between their religion and tlJ.eir academic performance. no matter what their faith.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 8, 1992 e PAGE 12 Give Me Sympathy or Give Me Death by Erin M. O'Neil Features Writer I'm sick. I hate being sick. I especially hate being sick at Union. Why, you ask'] Because nobody cares. Everyone just says \Feel better!\ and goes on with their lives. Yeah, like now I'm going to feel oh so mucb better. just because my roommates told me to. I want sympathy damn it! Where's my mother when I need her? When I'm sick at home I get waited on hand and foot, with the occasional, \Poor baby!\. None of this · \Feel better! See you later!\ crap. My mom would never do that to me, on the contrary, she'd be at the supermarket buying me all my favorite tfeats. Feel sorry for me! Since. I lmow you won't, I plan to use this article to bitch, bitch, bitch! Aren't you sorry you told me to \Feel better!\? For many communities in the developing world, fields of dreams are crops providing food security for their families and neigh- bors. Peace Corps Volun- teers have been working for 30 years with farm families to use their own resources and lands, in- crease yields, decrease post-harvest losses, and introduce improved soil and water conservation techniques that enable them to insure food stabil- ity for future generatio~s. First of all, my nose has been stuffed up since the second week of classes. I have gone through roughly three boxes of family size tissues. I tend to blow my 11ose very loudly, and very often. This is highly annoying to my roommates and friends, and they even ask me to stop. I just think, \Ha! If you would just give me ~ym:pathy, this wouldn't have to happen!\ and keep right (:)D blowing. If someone just gave me some sympathy, just once, I am certain that I could convince my body to stay healthy. Okay, second ailment.

CAN YOU FIND LOVE ON A BLIND DATE? by Dass Seaman Features Editor Have you ever been on a Blind date? I've heard and stories about how these things end up, but I never imagined in a million years what happened on mine. You would not believe what happened, but its the truth. We were supposed to meet at this little place called \Christopher's\ at one o'clock for lunch. I waited for about an hour and was on the verge of saying ''See Ya!\ when this sweaty panting guy stumbled into the cafe. \Oh God,\ I thought. \Could this be it?\ In his baggy khakis and untucked white tee-shirt, he beg.an scanning the place for someone who fit my description. I buried my head in the menu, but before I knew it, I heard heavy breathing and a voice that spurted, \Karen?\ \Ah yeah? Oh, Alan. You must be Alan. Hi\ \Hi! he said, completely out of breath. \ I'm so sorry I'm late. I mean, nice to meet you. I'm sorry but my bike got stolen because I forgot to lock it up when I went in to the store to buy-- long story. Anyway, I'm sorry.\ \Its' OK. _Want to look at the menu?\ I offered. \Yea!\ He began scanning this menu. He looked up and noticed I wasn't looking. \ Are you going to look at your menu?\ \I've memorized it already,\ I said smiling., knowing that I had no tiling better to do while I was waiting. He knew it too and smiled apologetically. The waiter came over and asked if he could take our order. I began to say \Yes-\ but at the same time he said ,\ A couple more minutes.\ I was c<>mpletely starving, but I said sweetly to the waiter, \A couple more minutes.\ Final 1 Ly. about ten minutes later the waiter came back. I ordered a salad. He ordered the triple layer \Lumberjack's Manwich\ and a beer. We both watched the waiter disappear into the kitchen. \So?\ I said. \So .... II be said. There was a painful pause. I smiled. He smiled. \Well I'm so glad I've finally bad the chance to meet you,\ I said. He said enthusiastically, \Yea your voice sounds different on the phone! \ \Yea... So, what are you studying at school? II \I doll't really study.\ And he laughed to himself for a while. Private joke, I thought. \No really, 11 he said. \I'm a writer.\ \OreaL I'm a math major.\ \Numbers ... \ he contemplated. \I'm a math moron,\ he confessed. \I bet you're not that stupid,\ I assured. He looked at me with surprise. I explained, 11 I mean, you're not stupid. It's just that math isn't so bad.\ The more I spoke, the softer I got. It was si.lent. I looked around the table at the forks, the knives, our cups filled with water, the hang nail on my thumb. Yep. I looked up and noticed our waiter corning towards us with what might hopefully, oh please, be our food. \I think our food is corning,\ I said excitedly. '\Fast service,\ he said with relief. The waiter set our food down and we were both extremely content, with our food that is. I couldn't wait until this miserable thing is over. Eat and run is mv motto. Aian looked at his incredibly· huge sandwich. It had a six inch pile of meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and several unknowns. He looked at me and waited for me to take my first bite. Polite, I thought. Then he took the biggest bite I'd ever seen. All of a sudden, the huge layered insides of the sandwich came bursting out of 'he other side. There was nothing left in between the bread. He took tfte bread apart and tried to reassemble the sandwich. He tried picking up the gooey insides, but because of all the mayo, it slipped out of his fingers and back onto the plate. l giggled and he lookeo up, really embarrassed. I looked back down at my salad. He was struggling with that mess by using his hands. He got so frustrated, he stabbed the mess with his · fork. He smiled We, at Concordiensi.s, extend our apologies to Professor Meade for omitting last week's Watson Application advertisement. We hope this ommission did not severely hurt anyone.

He took another bite, carefully this time. He covered all the sides of the sandwich with a finger to prevent the s<mdwich from bursting again. He smiled at me as if for a approval. I smiled back. I couldn't help but notice the glob of mayo and the string of lettuce hanging from the comer of his mouth. I pretended not to notice. As though he felt an itch, he wiped it off with the back of his hand. The lettuce and mayo was now on the hack of his hand, and he saw it there, realizing it was on his face. He made a face like.\Oh great.\ and nonchalantly w,iped it on his lap. , \So are you going to write a novel or do you like poetry?\ I said, trying to make conversation. \I write mostly short stories and poetry,\ he said. He began talking about his work, but I could hardly concentrate on his words because he had a poppy seed right in the center of his teeth. I was trying so hard not to stare, but that poppy seed was staring right back at me. I just kept on saying \Yea... Uh, huh ... Great,\ tryingto sound interested He cleared his throat and seemed to prepare to say something important. \Karen he said seriously. II I'm really glad I've had the chance to meet you. Michelle talks about you all the time. I'm sorry for being so stra!lge and quiet in the beginning. That's how I get when I'm nervous ... \ and just as he said that he reached for his beer. He must have still been rather nervous because he totally spazed and spilled it all over me. \Oh!\ I said in despair. \Oh!\ he said in even more despair. \ I'm so sorry! II He leapt up with a napkin in hand to come to my rescue. He wasn't looking and he went head on CRASH into a waiter carrying a huge tray of desserts. There was a tremendous clatter. Then the whole cafe was silent. I saw it happen in slow motion. Up went ice cream parfait, apple pie, chocolate mousse. Down went the ice cream parfait, the apple pie, the chocolate mousse~- all over Alan, who presently had been knocked to the ground. Alan was totally A Ia mode. I burst out laughing. He started to laugh too, but he held it back and said, \It's not funny.\ I shook my head \No\ and kept laughing. \It's not funny,\ he said smiling and threw a piece of pie at my face. It splatted on my face and we laughed even harder. I threw what was on my face back at him and we got into a dessert fight. We got kicked out of the cafe and walked home, sampling our free dessert off each other. It was true love. If you don't believe me, ask Alan. No, better not. He'll tell you we met on \The Love Boat.\ ••••• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • Concordiensis S-UBSCRIPT! 0 NS • $40/yr. $100/3 yr. • DON'T YOUR PARENTS WANT TO KNOW ABOUT UNION? ••••• WRITE FOR FEATURES CALL DUG ·X 4040 • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •

HEAD OF THE MOHAWK TESTS CREW TEAM'S STRENGTH By Steve Mooar Contributing Writer Union College Crew had its only home race of the fall season this past Saturday at The Head of the Mow hawk Regatta. The morning sun was tainted by a stiff down river wind, but the Union boats seemed to feed off several hundred fans that crowded the banks of the Mowhawk. The team attacked each race with an aggressive style that led to five first place finishes and two second place finishes. This was the first race for the novice team and they took advantage of the racing experience. The novice men•s eight was very impressive as they took first place. The. novice women were also impressive as they took secon<J in the novice women's eight category. The varsity team picked up where the novice team left off. Coxswains J J. Weiner and Becca Perchik each led two boats to victory. Becca coxed the varsity women to first place finishes in both the open four and open eight races. While the men finished one, two in the open four event and first in the open eight. In addition to the large shells. Matt Green and Pete Schwab raced singles this past weekend.

Proof of this NHL commando-style play is written all over his face in the form of ( cont'd from page 20) · goals. The Stars can't rely on Neal Broten and Brian Propp to win games, and unless Mike Modano all of a sudden turns into Jeremy Roenick, we are looking at an early vacation in Minnesota this season. 6. Tampa Bay- All the show Phil Esposito's expansion team has given us so far has been off the ice. Well, don't forget his . publicity stunt by giving a tryout to a female goalie who clearly had no chance to play in the NHL. The biggest question for this season will be whether or not Tampa's arena was engineered well enough to stand up to the hurricanes and tornados which have been ravaging the area. I'm not sure if Florida bas any hockey fans anyway, but at least they have Disney World and a new theme park. Smythe Division: 1. Vancouver- Led by rookie sensation Pavel Bure, the Cariucks are the most talented team in this division. They can skate, hit, score and they work hard. Kirk McLean is a talented goalie, and based on pure potential, Vancouver should win this division. 2. Calgary- The Flames aren't much different now from the Stanley Cup Championship team of three years ago. There is a lot of talent in Theo Fleury, Joe Niewendyk, Gary Roberts, Gary Suter and AI Macinnis, among others. If their egos have finally ·subsided from their Stanley Cup win, they may make a good playoff team. 3. Los Angeles- Take a hint from the Penguins, and learn to play some defense! As always, . Gretzky and Co. will score a lot while leaving goalie Kelly Hrudey to be assaulted. Gretzky has lost a lot of his scoring ability due to a bad back, and Hrudey is not super- human. No team succeeds without defense. 4. Winnipeg- The Jets will squeek into the playoffs with solid defense. Phil Housley is the most underrated defenseman in the league and Teppo Numminen and Fredrik Olausson are solid on defense. Goalie Bob Essensa is serviceable, and there is some offensive talent in Ed Olczyk, Thomas Steen and Pat Elynuik. If the Jets stay healthy, a rarity they will be good. ' 5. Edmonton- As much as I admire how GM Glen Sather has managed to win after losing so many great players black eyes and manly scars. Much to the Union veterans' dismay, the first of Union's numerous scores was achieved by a freshman, Mike.smmething. Port, deBoer. Austin. Chet, Sears, and Skip Aycox also added points to Union's 21-0 victory. The Syracuse A side wept, and Union was satisfied. Union's fine Killer B side also proved victorious. Their level of Rugby, ever increasing in finesse. reinforced the statement that Union's A- side so aptly made. UNION RUGBY is a tradition of champions. Mark K ... something (another freshman~ showed no fear as he led the B side line to score after repeated s.core. Union praises these fine young athletes. As the team took to the road to return to Union to rejoice over their victory, good byes weFe said to the: numerous fans who included some freshman's parents, a fellow diner from Denny's, and the NBC cameramen. From the point of view of this washed-up. balding, men's club Rugby player, this was a day not soon to be forgotten. Next week the U.R.F.C. will again take to the road to take on Siena. All are welcome as the school is located only minutes away. Directions are avaHable from our proficient match secretary Peder (I w:ish I could spell his last name, but anyway, he is a Sig Phi). (Gretzky, Kurri, Coffey, Messier), it is time to rebuild. The Oiler~ acquired Shayne Corson, B-rent Gilchrist and Vladimir Vujtek for Vincent Damphous:se, and along with Bernie Nicchols and Esa Tikkanen, the Oilers will be respectable, but they need time to rebuild. Goalie Bill Ranford, the best in the division, will keep them in the playoff hunt. 6. San Jose- The Sharks did fairly well last year (for an expansion team), winning 17 games. and losing another 17 by only ()ne goal. However, they still have a long way to go to make trne playoffs, even in this relatively bad division. Well, I hope everybody is now ready for an exciting season of NHL hockey which will now be on ESPN. But you better enjoy it this yearl When the collective bargaining agreement between owners and players expires before next season, and with players like Lemieux and Lindros signing record setting contracts this season, no one knows what the future of the league win be.

by Hal Poret Associnte Sports Editor As the 1992-93 hockey season begins, we must not only wonder which team will win the Stanley Cup but also what is the future of the NHL. Due to the regrettable fact that the l~gue has been in the incompetent hands of President John Ziegler up until this season, it is a miracle that the league is still in existence. Because of the inability of the league to control fighting and illegal stick fouls. the NHL has been viewed by many as a second-class sports league, needing a gimmick to attract attention. Thus, it has been unable to get a major television network contract to bring in the dollars which the NBA is now earning, and just as importantly, much of America has yet to trllly experience the excitement and athleticism which hockey has to offer when the camera is not focused on two goo11s slugging it out. Finally, Ziegler is gone and interim President Gil Stern has been voted in. New rules have been made to hinder dangerous high-sticking injuries and which make it a penalty for grabbing an opponent's stick. In addition, any player instigating a fight will now be ejected from the game and subject to fines and/or suspension. Though these rules: are not strong enough, they are a step in the right direction towards getting rid of untalented \fighters\ and allowing the graceful \finesse\ players to e\hibit their talents. In addition, the NHL has no\\ signed a television contract with ESPN, which should do a much better jon of marketing the league than did Sports Channel America which almost single-handedly sunk the NHL last season. But I'm sure you fans want to hear about the teams, so here are some predictions and team descriptions to prepare you for the season. Patrick Division: 1. New York Rangers- This is the most talented team in the league bar-none. To last year's brilliant squad, G.M. Neil Smith has now added Aleksei Kovalev, the 19- year old Russian winger who starred in the Unified Team's Olympic gold-medal run. Add Kovalev 's phenomenal skating and stickwork to names like Messier, Gartner, Amonte, Graves, Turcotte and Leetch, and this is the most explosive offense in the NHL. The Rangers have also added former Penguin Phil Bourque to their defense. Bourque's aggressive checking along with Kovalev's former Russian teammate Sergei Zubov will help solidify an already good defense whic~ is backed up by the best goal-tending tandem in . the league. 2. Pittsburgh- The Penguins are chock-full of talent with Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr. Kevin Stevens, and Tom Barrasso in goal, but they never seem to get it together until the playoffs. 3. New York Islanders- This will be a surprisingly good team. The Isles have two excellent offensive lines with Pierre Turgeon, Adam Creighton, Steve Thomas, Benoit Hogue, Derek King, and Ray Ferraro. If goalie Mark Fitzpatrick can overcome injuries and perform to his potential, this could be a solid playoff team. 4. Washington- The Caps have a strong defensive unit in goalie Don Beaupre and defensemen Kevin Hatcher, AI Iafrate, Calle Johansson, Sylvain Cote and Rod Langway. But without much firepower, they will struggle to make the playoffs in hockey's toughest <livision. 5. New Jersey- Without defenseman Eric Weinrich and with Russian defensemen Slava Fetisov and Aleksei Kasatonov slowing down, their defense will be suspect. If star center Peter Stastny jumps back to Quebec as expected, the Devils could be in trouble. 6. Philadelphia- Eric Lindros and his smounding cast of no one (actually there are a few players left on the team but almost anyone of significance was traded to acquire him) will struggle badly, but if Lindros can deal with the heat from the fans when the Flye-rs don't succeed at first, he will develop into one of the NHL' s most exciting players. Adams Division: L Montreal- With the best goalie in the league, Patrick Roy, and their strong young defense (Eric Desjardins. Matthieu Schnieder)., the Habs are guarmteed to fi11ish near the top. The off-season acquisiti<m of Vincent DamphotJsse from Edmonton and 7 -time 30-goal scorer Brian Be-llows (Minnesota) will ad<l some flare and emotion to a talented veteran offense of Denis Savard, Brian S:krudland and Kirk Muller among others. 2. Buffalo· New coach John Muckier will hopefully bring from Edmonton some of his winning attitude to a talented offensive ,group including Pat LaFontaine. Dale Hawerchuk and ALexander Mogilny. However, the Sabres had to rely on rookie goaltender Tom Draper last year when Darren Puppa couldn't do the job. A questionable defense and lack of faith in the goalie position will hurt. 3. Boston- If Cam Neely can recover from a blown-out knee, which catLsed him to miss all but 9 games last year, the Bruins could be a real threat. Don't count on it. They still have high-scoring defenseman Ray Bourque and center Adam Oates, but with Andy Moog (goalie) getting old, Boston will struggle. Luckily, they play in the Adams so a playoff spot for them is already reserved. 4. Hartford~ The Whalers have good talent in John Cullen, Bobby Holik, Pat Verbeek, Zarley Zalapski, etc. but the loss of goalie Petr Sidorkiewicz will hurt. They have yet to determine whether they can count on Kay Whitmore in goal. Their reign as \playoff-team by default\ is running out. 5. Quebec- Look at the talent the Nordiq11e now has: Mike Ricci, Joe Sakic, Mats Sundin, Owen Nolan, Peter Forsberg, Steve Duchesne and possibly Peter Stastny! They'll need time to gel as a team, and some better goal-tending, but by next season, they will challenge Hartford for the last playoff spot in the Adams Division. 6. Ottowa- Their chief acquisitions have been Sidorkiewicz in goal, Sylvain Turgeon, and Mike Peluso, last year's leader in penalty minutes. Watch for rookie draft pick Zach Wittenberg, a product of Cornell's hockey program. to excel, but otb.er than that, this is a bad team. Norris Division: 1. Detroit- Last year's highest scoring team in the Cambell Conference, led by captains Steve Yzerman and Sergei Federov, will once again be a powerhouse. The Wings have added a tough scorer in winger Dino Ciccarelli, to complement wingers Pa11l Y sebaert and Ray Sheppard. 'They will score like crazy without a dollht, but goalie Tim Cheveldae will have to be extremely sharp to hold off the Blackhawks for the division lead. 2. Chicago- This is an excellent all-around team. Chris Chelios and Steve Smith provide sound defense, Ed Belfour is a top-notch goaltender, and the Hawks have a formidable offense led by Jeremy Roenick and Steve. Larmer. If young forwards Brian Noonan, Stephane Matteau and Mike Hudson can contribute, the Hawks could be a first place team. Though it usually takes Chicago half a season to get going, you will bear from them in the playoffs. 3. St.Louis- O.K. You own the Blues. You have the league's most prolific goal scorer in Brett Hull and an excellent center in Adam Oates, who not only scores, but is a brilliant passer and works wonderfully with Hull. So why trade him? Craig Janney is a good hockey- player, but Hull and the Blues will suffer without Oates, and their defense still hasn't recovered from losing Scott Stevens to the Devils as compensation for signing Brendan Shanahan. Bad administrative moves have hurt the Blues. 4. Toronto- Coach Pat Burns will stress defense, and goalie Grant Fuhr has another good year or two in him. Winger Wendell Clark and aging forwards Doug Gilmour and Glenn Anderson can make a run at the playoffs if the NorthStars falter. 5. Minnesota- The Stars have a decent goalie in Jon Casey and some solid defense from Mark Tinordi and Derian Hatcher. But why in, the world did they trade their all-time leading goal-scorer and team leader Brian Bellows for Russ Courtnall? Bellows, a 7-time 30-goal scorer and one-time 5:5 goal scorer, cannot nearly be replaced by Collrtnall who's best goal production was 29 :1 ' . i! . ' \I \ ~'I' l. tl ! i

News Editor The S UIVey of the Class of 1991 wa.s released by the Career Development Center last week. The survey. done each yea:-, shows how many Union College graduates are engaged in further study, employed., or unemployed. The Career Development Center was able to chart the progress of Union College graduates through phone calls and mail surveys. Seventy- seven percent of the graduates from tile Class of 1991 responded to the survey. This is a significant decline from the response rates of past years. r canne Tobiesson, the Directo:r of the Career Devel()J.Jment Center, attributed most of the decline to bad timing. For the Survey of the Class of 1990, the response rate was eighty-nine percent. Sixty-1wo percent of the respondents are employed, thirty-th:ree percent are are engaged ·ill further study, and four perc~nt are unemployed. Those percentages are consistent with the results of past surveys. The unemplo.yment rate for respondents dropped from nearly six :percent for the Class of 1990 t() about four percent for the Cla.ss of 1991. The mo:st popular areas of employment for Union College alumni who responded to the survey were finance/lnnking (6. 7% ), business/IIlanagement (6.2% ), sales/matiketing (5.1 %). and health/ltUlllan services (4.1 %). For the Class of 1990, sales/marlteting was the most popular ar-ea of employment, with 7.9% of the respondents holding jobs in this area. In 1990, 5.8o/b of the respondents held go1'ernment jobs, as opposed to only 3.6% of the responden1s from the Class of 1991. AIDS AWARENESS PAGE 2 The field that saw the largest increase in alumni employment was health/human services. Only 1.2% of the respondents from 1990 were employed in this field. For the Olass of 199L, this percentage llad increased to4.1%. The field that had the most notable decline in alumni employment was mechanical engineering. Ollly 2.8%ofthe respondents from the Class of 1991 were employed as mechanical ellgineers, as opposed to 5.6% of the respondents from the Class of 1990. The same trend can be found in the area of electrical Category 1991 Number of graduates 507 Number of respondents 389 Percentage of The areas of employment for the respondents varied · along gender lines. Men were employed more than women in finance/banking, computer science and civil engineering. Women were more apt to hold jobs in business/management, sales/marketing, health/human services, and education/ student personnel.

Ten percent of the respondents from the Class of 1986 were employed in electrical engineering. Only about one percen1 of the respondents from the Class of 1991 are emJ)Ioyed in this field. · There has been a noticeable decline in the number of students who choose to major in electrical or mechanical engineering at Union College. Law school and medic' l school, as they have been 1' r years, were the most popu1. areas of further study. Law school attracted eight percent of the responding graduates, while 6.2% of the respondents went to medical school. Although both of those . percentages are slightly higher than they had been from the previous survey, the number continued on page 3 Union College has created an Assessment Advisory Board that will oversee the ptogress of the General Education (Gen. Ed.) Program, and make suggestions for future improvements. Gen. Ed. Director and Classics Professor Christina Sorum heads the committee. \It's exciting,\ she said. \The students meet at my house every Tuesday night (for dinner) and we exchange views al)d suggestions about the effectiveness of the Gen. Ed. program.\ In addition to the free food, Professor Sorum believes that the student volunteers, who commit a major .portion of time to this organization, come away with a better understanding of the important role that a solid undergraduate education plays in a student's personal and educational development. This review board is the first of its kind because it allows students to have significant input into what their college experience should involve. The analysis of the curriculum is broken down into three separate parts. First, audits of transcripts are done to insure that enough courses are being taken by students, and that they are taken at the right times during the four years. This also serves to assess how the Gen. Ed. requirements affect majors, class enrollment patterns, and Terms Abroad. The second component is a Faculty Assessment. Each member of the faculty is given a questionnaire asking his/her impressions of the Gen. Ed. program after its first four years. Are the kinds of things that they want to happen in the classroom happening? Are the students responsive to the material being presented? These, and other questions help to give the review board an additional perspective. The group will prepare a survey sheet to be given out to students during the winter term. The results will be released in the spring. This survey will consist of questions aimed at getting a sense of what the students think of Gen. Ed. at Union. Professor Sorum advocated the consulting of students in evaluating the Gen. Ed. program. \It's your education, and you as a student should care what goes into it. Students today need to have a much wider knowledge and understanding than was the case when my generation went to school.. An awareness of the multiplicity of cultures and their interrelationships, for instance, is very important in t<xlay's society.\ Although it is obvious that not all suggestions will be implemented, the high degree of student involvement opens up a whole new realm of input in which the students have control over their education. On November 1, the group will find out if it is to receive a $100,000 grant from the Pew Foundation. This grant, if received, will used to fund related projects. It is not too late to join the Student Assesment Group. Freshman will be permitted to attend meetings in the spring term, and any upperclassman who wishes to become involved can contact Professor Sorum at Ex. 6067. Fresh ideas, a willingness to work hard, and a strong initiative can be useful in helping the org 11ization to be effective in m , ntaining the quality of education found at Union.

A Celebration :of Nature Through Music ------------------ by Caroline :Paine Concordiensis Staff This year the Adirondack Park will celebrate 100 years of protected natural beauty. To commemorate this occasion compcser Hilary 'Jann will conduct the world premiere of her ))ieee Adirondack Light with tfue Glens Falls Symphony I Orchestra 011 Sunday, October 1 associate professer in Onion's Arts Department, told a writer for the Glens Falls Symphony Orchestra. Tann's tnu.sic reflects her concern for the preservation of our natural surroundings. To better ,touch the audience with her b'Ve and respect of our planet, rann is . incorporating a narrrator into her piece. The text cbosen te accompany the orcbest:ra is \A Hilary Tanni t() conduct Adirondack Light 18. The work was Lesson from the Hudson :River commissioned by Hugh Allen School: Glens Falls. NY, Wilso11, the Music Director for : the Glens Falls Symphony Orchestra to celebrate the park's centennial. \I .i!ave composed a piece which celebrates the 'certain bluste~ quality of light' of the Adirondacks,\ Tann. an 1848\ a poem from J<Jr<!an Smith's book, North Cowzty. Smith, an English pr<Jfessor at Union, and 'Tann collaborated to prcduce the effect of a lone v.ral:ker responding to the deep beauty SECURITY REPORT of the Adirondacks. Although narration is used, Adirondack Light will not be a poetic reading accompanied by music. lilsffad, the music will create its own image. tbrougb this tb.e poem will come into view. The musical section of Adirond(tek Lig,ht is to be perf()rme-d by a classical chamber orchestra in four parts. The first two sections conger images of light playing over a millrace and on the Hudson River. The third section introduces the narrator and tells tbe story of a traveler from Boston who is mesmerized by the romantic qualityo~ the Adirondacks. In the final section the narrator withdraws and the music is left to draw the listener's imagination to a conclusion. Tann not only uses poetry to create the sensations of the adiron<iacks in her piece, she also incorporates four Adirondack folk songs. \Come all ye Maidens\ \The Wild Mustard River\ \The Ballad of the Blue Mountain Lake\ and \Once more A,- Lumbering Go\ are interwoven into her piece. This serves to take the audience away into the history and beauty of the park. Originality, folk songs, and poetry are brought together .and transformed into one musical celebration of the light and atmospller.e of the Adirondacks. The concert will take place in the Queensbury High Scltool Auditorium at 3pm. Haydn's Symphony #99 and Metlelssohn's Italian S y m. p h o n y will also be performed. COt\ICORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 15, 1992 • PAGE 2 .. Student Forum Spotlight by Alexaader Sklavos Student F tJrum President At this week's Student Forum Meeting, we were joined by President Hull and Dean Mamrn()Ja. The first, and biggest issue that was discussed. was Union's social policy, and how the Student Forum will concentrate on providing social alternatives. This led right into a conversation about Chet's. The main questions about Chet's were: (I.) How can it be improved?, (2.) Can it be avail~ble moJJe nights?, and (3.) Is there a better location that is available? At this point in time, there does not seem to be a feasible alternative to leaving Chet's in the College Center Atrium. Fero House (a.k.a. Beta) came up as a potential location. Unfortunately, fire codes prevent a large number of people to gather in Fero. h This idea led us to the 'question of h-ew to improve what we have. Track lights. to improve lighting on stage, will be going 11p in Chet's very soon. Estimates are being researched on either a heavy curtain, or a C()llapsible wall to serve as a divider between Chet's and The D11tch Hollow. We believe this will greatly improve the atmosphere. Chet's also will be branching out into \theme\ nights such as a Mexica11 Fiesta with refreshments to match (i.e. Margaritas, Pina Coladas, taco chips, etc.). Cl1et's also most likely will be going to a rn()re traditional 'Pub repertoire' of refreshments in the future. The Alumai. Gym again came up in discussion this past week - specifically what we could do in tile long and short run to impmve the facilities. In the long ru11 President H11U said that the atilletes equipment may be moved to the curling area in the rink. Thus there wilt be an extra room available in Alumni Gym for any new exercise macllines that may be purchased (i.e. stairmasters, rowing machines. treadmill). In the short run there are simple steps tllat can and will be taken to improve the gym. Increasing tile hours of tile gym to possibly midnight, piping some music into t!J.e weight rooms. and possibly purchasing some new equipment are some ideas. Notes: The Student Forum is hosting a Union College \Town Meeting,\ open to all students and faculty. It will be today 10/15 at .6:30 in Chet\s (Free Food). All of the issues mentioned and more will be discussed. Please come and contribute your ideas on how . ' . to improve our commumty. Elections for t.iJree Freshman Jepresentatives, and one Senior representative to the Student Forum will be held Friday 10/30. Petiticns are available in the Student Activities offke (C.C. 408) and are due Moaday 10/26. Our next meeting will be on Monday 10/19 in C.C. 409. DATE LOCAl!

Famous pbrases, like \it cowdn't happen to me,\ \I don't have a drinking· problem,\ \everyone's doing it\ or \'I'm so fat\ come to mind as ways to excuse a lot of theirbebaviors. Union college senses this and in an attempt to make the issues more realistic to students, they have planned a number of events dealing with a subject tllat affects us all. for the upcoming week. Next week . is the AIDS awareness}Changing Behaviors: Students at Risk series. It is strongly encouraged that all studeats c:orne, even if they think they are in the \it couldn't happen to me\ category. The series of discussions and speakers are focusing not only on AIDS, but on homophobia. safe sex, and a greater understanding of risky behavior.

JOIN THE NEWS STAFF TODAY CALL DAVE X4208 SURVEY OF 'l'H E CLASS OF 1991 continued from page 1 of students going to medical school and law scho(!)l has declined .considerably o-ver the past five or six years. In the past four years, the pereentage of students going ·to medical scnool llas dropped from approximately eleven percen to about six percent. Th·ere were some differences between men and women in the areas that they choose to go to graduate school for. Fifteen of the twenty-four respondents who went to medical school were women. Nine of th.e thirteen respondents who ch()se to study education were women. However, of the thirty-one students who went to law school, sixteen were men and fifteen were women. The survey, which Hsts all of the graduate school:s now being attended by. Union College graduates, seems to contain very few 'prestigious' graduate schools. Of the thirty-one students from the Class of 1991 that are currently enrolled ill law school, only four atten{i law schools that ranked a.mong U.S. News & World Report's Top 25. None of the t'Nenty- four medical students attend a school that was ranked among the top 15. Professor William R<Jth, the director of Union's pre- medical program, expLained that althollgh Union ha.s not been very successful at placing students in top-ranked medical schools over the past few years, that he believed that the situation would improve. Professor Roth explained that the list released by the Career Development Center was not complete. The list does not reflect those students who were accepted to good medical schools , l>ut did not attend for financial reasons. The list could not include those stude111s who .. took a year off from school\ and then applied to medical school. In general, average MCA T scores for Union students have fallen from being four _points above the national average to being only one or two points above the national average. Still~ according to ?rofcssor Rotlt, the average score from Unio11 students is about the same as tile average score for Amllerst students, and only sligh-tly lower than Dartmouth stude11ts. Professor Roth admitted that the Class of 1991 was one of the l<Jwest classes in terms of theirs tati stical accom p- lishments. According to Roth, the average college student across the nation is probably weaker academically than the average student was about ten or fifteen years ago. In additio11, the rise in applications has made graduate schools much more selective. The administration has expressed optimism that future gradtJating students will have better academic records becatJse the school IS becorning more selective.

CONCORDIENSIS e OCTOBER 15, 1992 • PAGE 4 by Jim Polites News Analysis Editor The gathering of the three major Presidential candidates · in St. Louis, Missouri turned · out to be much less fireworks andl much more caution than anyone- including me- expected. For those 60 million that tuned in this past Sunday night hoping to witness fireworks and scathing rhetoric, the evening's festivities must have been both disappointing and uneventful. Still, there were many interesting statements, lightly- veiled attacks, moments of humor, and poignant answers. USA Today reported the next day that following the debate, 63% found Ross Perot in a more favorable light, 29% thought the same of Governor Clinton, while just 13% believed the President distinguished himself. Watching the post-mordem reports on NBC, Tom Brokaw No Fireworks In Saint Louis and his team were quick to point out tllat each candidate brought eut :!lis strengths t0 the American a11dience. For Bill Clinton~ it was the caH for change ami a challenge to the country to move from the failed practices of trickle-down economics. George Bush also emphasized change, but instead tended IX> focus on the gteat world transformation- where the end w 11>oth Communism and the Cold War enable us all fo sleep better at nig.ht. Finally, Ross Perot was his. indomitable self- straight-talk and wisecracks about the · nation's economic woes and : how he prescribes to fix our, bludgeoning deficit and debt. White I did agree with NBC's general assessment, there were a number of other:· details that caught my attention. First and foremost, I I thought Gemge Bush made. alot of good points. In fact, I. believe this could have been the Preside11t's most effective public at>pea.rance (including his speech to the Republican C()nvention in Houston) since the race began. Mr. Bush had strong, popular statements on family values, drug c0ntrot and Face relations in our cities, character, tmst, and foreign affairs. I got the feeling, thollgh, that he was preoccupied wi~h sounding believable, experienced, and pate:malistic- often at the expense of sounding 'soft'. His appeal has always been an identification with the middle class (despite his wealth and Ivy League education), but obviously it's wearing thin these days. In the next two debates, Bush must find a tone · that will highlight his nice guy image yet reinforce his sense of commitment to the issues. I thought Governor Clinton on the other hand presented himself extremely well. He lo()ked statesmanlike yet compassionate and acted like tile leader of a national race- Mr. Clinton was taught well that Presidential debates are part rhe1toric and mostly theater. In short he looked like a man Ieady to become the next Presid.etJ.t. What I didn't appFeciate was Clinton taking · time from tile debate to wish his wife a happy 17th anniversary. Some might argue that it was a clever ploy establishiirg the strength and ·durability ()f bis family, but I'm skeptical as to whether or not it had a pla~e in the proceedings. Finally, I'm baffled by the immediate acclaim that has come to Ross Perot following the events in St. Louis. I can only assume his to11gh-talking message tinged with sarcasm and humor found a receptive audience witb the Sunday evening baseball and football crowd. When the discussion moved to drugs, and Mr. Perot vented his outrage at 'those driving BMWs who couldn't work the tllird shift at Dairy Queen', I thought it was his best rnomellt of the evening. He said what much of middle America was thinking at the time and he wasn't afraid of offending people. Still, I was put off by his lack of content- something that will continue to plague him until he comes up with specific . proposals (besides the gasoline tax). Finally, in defiance of what the national newspapers 'are saying, I think his ''I'm all ·ears\ Hne was anything but planned, it was more a comic ·. slip of the tongue that turned · · out to be amusing to the live ·· crowd. Perhaps ominously, there were no .personal value questions posed to the ' candidates. A Vietnam · scenario to Govem0r Clinton . or abortion probe on George Bush could make things extremely interesting next • week. One thing's for sure, if Clinton, Bush, and Perot hope to hit the elusive 'home run' their staffs all refer to, maintaining such civility will be impossible. Stay tuned,. those fireworks might just be around the comer. IN YOUR OPINION!* DO YOll ACTIVELY PRACTICE YOUR RELIGION?

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 1 The Measure Of A Statesman by Dan Keniry Contributing WriJer As a recent Union graduate currently working in Washington, I feel compelled to explain to other young voters why I believe President Bush is best qualified to serve as our President for an ~dditional four years. Any mformed voter, before going to the polls, should answer some basic questions. When one reflects on these issues, it is clear that George Bush merits another term. First, is the candidate qualified for the job? President Bush is the best qualified candidate running this year, and is one of the most qualified presidents ever to serve in office. The list of George Bush's former jobs is long and prestigious- World War II fighter pilot, businessman, U.S. Congressman, Ambassador to China, Director of the CIA, head ·of the Republican Nartional Committee, and Vice-President to Ronald Reagan. The importance of Pn:siclcnt Bush'!i experience was highlighted by fflc Pcrsi3n Gulf War. When Iraq hrutaJly invadCd Kuwait in I Q90, the President handled the difficu1t issues skillfu·lly because he had dealt with them for the last 25 years. He knew the horror of combat, battle- tested as he was at the age of 18. He knew the mechanics of world energy markets, h~vlng worked in Texas as an entrepreneur. He realized the , importance of Congressional and public support for the \\War effort, and his service ifl that body helped him win approval. · He knew world leaders on a personal level from his years in China, at the CIA, and as a Vice-President. This enabled him to forge a worldwide coalition that helped the U.S. achieve victory in the Gulf. A good President is rnore than just a skiHful negotiator or tactician. The President sets the moral tone for our nation, and the kind of person lle is reflects upon us. George Bush is a likeable guy, a father and grandfather, and an active sportsman.

President Bush created new American jobs by making those with disabilities eligible for meaningful employment.

He used his persuasive skills to highlight Congress' embarrassing financial· record and urged voters to affect change in Washington by voti11g out ~neffective members.

It is wisest to trust an experienced and tested leader to manage such difficuJ,t economic and social tasks. Having dealt with worldwide threats to American security, the Pr~sident can lead national fights fur higher employment, expand~i health care, and better schools.

A Toast to Wine by Brumo Benzaquen Contriiwting Writer Next to beer.,. wine is the most widely con.surned alcoholic beverage in ~he world. A total of 10 bi Ilion ga-llons are imbibed ann11mly. France and Italy have H1e highest ,per capita consumption , approximate:ly 22 gallons a year, with the U.S. t:Failing behind at a nnere 2 gallons :per year per perseln. Wine has always played an important r<>le in religious ceremonies lilld in the general culture of people. In some cultures it is believed that consuming wirte has beneficial health effect~. Indeed. there might be some truth ill this, some prelimi!lary studies show that wine m~:y contain some substances that confer a certain protection against heart d:i~ase. To swpport this theory I mention that France and Italy have the lowest incidence of heart disea~e in all of industrialized l[)ations. A study at Baylor college.of medicine showed that moderate alcoh()l consumption, the equivalent of 2 glasses of _wine a day, can produce ~n elevation of BDL ( a protem factor associated with low cholesterol levels) identical to that producecl by regul~r jogging. A pnonal note: m any case the claB.gers of alcohol. greatly outweigll any poten~a,I benefit rerated t.o lt s consumpti()ll.

The making of wine is the oldest known process to man. When Noah landed after the flood, his initial mission was to plant a vineyard in order to get drunk, and for him and llitl sons to have children; not a very good combination by today's standards! The Greeks conserved and ~ged their wines in aoophoras coated with resins. They dev-eloped a taste for this kind of wine and today still con:sume retsina. In the dark ages, and dark it was indeed, the fools lost the secret of the amphoras and thus had to drink the wine young since they had uo means to age it , forming ¥inegar. YUCK! The cork was disc()vered in tile 18th century, all&wmg for wine to be aged in bettles. It was a magical moment, in which wine drinkers became wine lovers. The alcohol in wine is the result of fermentation: of the sugars present in the fruit, glucose and fructose. The fermentation process requires yeas:t,. a fungi. These are present in the skin of ~rapes and they are released on cmshing. This is why the wine· makers get barefoot an<l crush. the grapes with their feet ( scmetimes adding some yeast oflheir own; GROSS!) White wine is macle from either white or red grapes, they are bleached chemically. Red wine is made from red .grapt:~>, and rose from pink grapes. (Just kidding!). Aging is the most important and most mysterious process for wine chemists. It involves complex chemical conversions, first in barrels then in bottles. Champagne is expensive because it is difficult to produce. The bubbles are produced in a second fermentation that takes place in the bottle. The bottres are rotated everyday for a period of about 4 years, then the neck is frozen, the sediment ejected and the bottle is recapped with a small amount of sugar .. Depending on the amount of sugar present makes the difference between Brut, Extra dry or Sec champagne. The wines derive their name from the region the grapes were frrst picked for example. a Bordeaux or Bourgogne come from those regions of France as does champagne a region in the south of France. A personal anecdote: this year I went wine tasting at the Italian pavilion at the Expo in Seville .Spain, honestly I could not ten apart one wine from the other and I really don't know how they do it. Later on this summer, I drank a glass of wine from a Pettus, one of the most expensive wines itt the world (averaging of $1500 a bottle depending on the year) , but they might as well have served me a $15 daily wine!

From alleged extramarital affairs, to the smoking of marijuana, candidates are scrutinized from head to· toe. Since all their exploits are thrust upon the American people everyday, it is impossible for anyone to avoid forming an opinion. However, for · most people, deciding on one candidate is quite an endeavor. It is necessary to recognize and applaud all those · who have attempted to clarify the issues for themselves and others in order to make voting easier. One can start with all the on campus organizations that · are actively promoting our election process. Hundreds of additional students will vote because of on campus registration tables set up recently. The community can also p~fit from the many informative sessions created through nonpartisan discussion groups, posters, and flyers. Student participation in the election process has so far been quite favorable, but none of this will matter if we don't respond by placing a vote in the ballot box this November. Senator Blythe Fowler (Georgia) was recently asked by a group of college students to come speak at their university concerning election issues. His reply wa.s, \Why the hell should I, you people don't vote anyway.\ His offensive answer is somewhat justified by past years' low participation rates for college· students. This is where we cannot go wrong. By voting, we are not only taking advantage of an option most people don't have, but we are also changing other people's perspectives of our generation. Also, it might be the only chance some students have of making their one vote equal to that of President Hull or the Dean.

CONOORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 15. 1992 • PAGE 10 Bathroom Walls i~ Academic Halls, PART 11 A Man's Perspective From A Woman's Point Of View by Mirriam Seddiq Concordiensis Staff Two weeks ago I wrote an article about the graffiti in the stalls of the women's bathroom in Schaeffer library. 'Jhe foUowi11g day, the authorities of Uni()n College decided it was necessary to white wash, not the entire stall, but only those areas with the graffiti. Perhaps it is silly to say that they were attempting to silence the voice of Union College. Maybe ·the people who decided to clea11 up the stalts were · afraid of the negative image the graffiti might give to Union College. Or, maybe this was an attempt to get women to move their forum to the press, or other areas where they will have pul>lic exposure. Well, whatever the reasoning behind the re-decorating, it certainly came as a surprise.

It was meant to belittle the Snuggler, nothing more. I have no desire to start rumors, for you to say tbat is absurd. The Snuggler attacked my roommate, I realize that this is a serious issue. I would like to extend my heartfelt apologies to the victims if I have offended them in any way. To you Mr. Wolff, keep up the good work. None of us would like to see this happen again. Erin M.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 15, 1992 • PAGE 11 Social To the Editor: We are writing in regards to the outrageous enforcement of Union's social policy. While . we recognize the importance of • temperance in the consumption • of alcohol we do not feel that the current social policy at . Union justifiably promotes a healthy drinking atmosphere. Our most fundamental discontentment stems from the policy concerning weeknight parties at fraternities. The ' prohibition of gatherings of students during the week at fraternities when alcohol is present is :part of a social policy which denies a large percentage of students rights which are conceded to them across all of New York. Moreover, it strikes at the very heart of this college's vibrant social life; unfairly preventing students from visiting parts of the campus where they are welcome without restriction. Under Union's cun-ent social policy, fraternities are allowed to have as many people as they like in their houses during the week as long as alcohol is not present. However, as soon as alcohol is present a fraternity is in jeopardy of going on social probation. The unfaftness of this policy is self evident. If people who .are present at a fraternity are over twenty-one and want to <lrink: alcohol, it should be their prerogative. Policy Union and New York State Law see no problem with those twenty-one drinking alongside those who are minors. So why then are Union's policies so stringent durillg the week? Is it not clear that the current social .policy is unfair to fraternity members who are of legal drinking age. Union College is probably the only place in New York State where twenty~one year olds are forbidden to drink on weeknights. At the very least, Union needs to restruct1Jl1e- its social policy. Fraternities at Union are different from most every other fraternity in the nation. While houses at other schools · are characteristically elitist, • allowing only brothers and certain friends into the house on occasions other than parties, Union's houses .are extremely social , hosting events and welcoming students without prejudice. It is the Greek system at Union, more so than any other institution, which promotes a fun social atmosphere where all students are welcome. While Union fraternities have not in the past adopted \members only\ attitudes, the current social · policy is quickly forcing them in this direction. If it is t11e goal of Union's administration to minimize the importance of being Greek at Union this exhibit by: Unrest policy wholeheartedly contradicts it. In sum, it is not too much .to · ask that fraternities be allowed to have non-brothers in the house on weeknights tegardless Of whether there is beer in the house or not. Since any house on campus automatically has brothers over twenty-one it is somewhat unreasonable to expect that no house will have beer in it. Certainly, if students at Union have privileges granted to them by the state they do not expect Union to take them away. As students ;here at Union we expect the administration to · listen to our wants. To date, the school has not made any effort to address the grievances of the entire student body. It is our belief that Union owes the students here a chance to vote on what they dislike about the current social situation. Students must have the right to change what a clear majority of students dislike about the school. Respectfully Sllbmitted, Josh Goldberg & Jon Resnick Editor's Note: At 6:30 PM. today, a \town meeting\ will be held at Chet's. This will be an opportune time to vent any frustrations one might have with the administration's policies.

Everything Else You Need to Know A·bout Vitamins · To the Editor: I recently read the article \All You Wanted to !Cn<Jw About Vitamins,\ and I feel thllt some important informafi(Jn was omitted. I would like to add some of that imp<Jrtant information. The article menti<Jned that Vitamin a is a fat-soluble vitamin and that ,jt is toxic if taken in excess. Tlte re<lSOn for this is theat the fat soluble vitamins are stored in the body's fat reserves and. tend to accumulate, eveB to the point of toxicity. This explai11s why very few individuals ltave a deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins. There are a total of four fat-soluble vitamins; Vitamin A (needed for \ision) Vitamin D (needed f()r the absorbtion and mobilization of calcium), Vitamin E .~pr<Jtects cells by acti11g as an antioxidant), and Vitanin K (needed for blood ci<Jttiltg). All of these vitamins are potentially toxic wherJ 14llcen in large quantities. The other vitamins are classified as water-~oluble vitamins. The water-soluble vitamins include Vi tan in C r,needed for wound healing), the B-Complex Vitamins (needed in various enzyme s:ystems), Niacin (function as coenzymes), and Folic: Acid (needed for the pro<lllction of blood cells). There are several other water-soluble vitamins, however these are: the predominant ones. TJ1ese vitamins are generally safer than the fat-soluble vitamins. Since these vitamins are soluble in water, the body ~liminates any e:xcess ~generally through the 11rine) tnstead of storing tllem. The American Pharmaceutical Association has a few basic Guideli11e:s for takimz vitamins; 1) Read the labels em all vitamin or vitamin and mineral preparations before you take them. Compare tile contents and the amounts of vitamins and minerals with RDAs. 2) Take vitamins or vitamin and mineral supplements with meals to reduce stomach upset. 3} Do not take high doses of vitamin or minerals; high doses may be dangerous. IT is best not to exceed the RDA. Follow label directims. 4) Do not self-medicate a vitamin deficiency. If you believe that you are vitamin deficient, consult your physician or pharmacist. 5) For proper nutritiOn, eat foods from all the basic food groups; vitamin supplements are not a substitute for a well- balanced diet 6) Iron supplements or vitamins with iron may turn the stools black 1111d cause constipation. 7) Some vitamin supplements have a special coating and sh<mld be swallowed whole ( cbeck with your doctor or phat111acist). 8) Vitamins, like all medications, should !)e stored out of the reach of children (especially those c<Jutaining iron). 9) Children's vitamins are not candy; they are drugs and cannot be taken indiscriminately. 10) Niacin-containing products may cause a flushing sensation. 11) Riboflavin-cofltaining products (Vitamin B2) may cause a yellow fluorescence in the IJtine. 12) Doses higher than 10,00 ill of Vitamin A should not be taken without close medical 3upervision; it is toxic and can be teratogenic (cause damage to a fetus).

Of course not eve1yone is going to show up at room 409 in the coHege center on a friday afternoon, but at least 30, 20, maybe 15 at least were expected to show. Well, their loss! The students present at the meeting were able to share ideas and frustrations about our campus, (and got to sample the large selection of candy the officers served). President Hallie Heller, Vice Pres. Jon Miller, and Secretary Mike Quinn were ready and eager to answer questions and clear up confusion, especially about the infamous social policy. The officers insured us that social alternatives are being implemented. Chefs is under scrutiny again, since me administration and students are determined to create an enjoyable atmosphere. Another possibility was to establish a new pub at the Skellar, but this idea was ruled out earlier. One sophomore insisted. while others agreed, that a bar to hang out in will not instantaneously solve the problem. The only way to keep people on campus ~is to bring entertainment to Union. A steady flow of interesting speakers, great bands, and comedians seemed to be the popular solution. This, students contended; would make the lack of fraternity parties less detrimental to social life. But any addition on campus would be welcomed. An improved Chet's, and the new Fero house are possibilities. At the meeting, we also discussed ways to individually make a difference. One would be to show up at class meetings! Another means to Arc You Ready? voice opinions is through the petitions going around campus. Keep your eyes open for them. and take the time to read them.

Renegade Campaign Ends With Ambush - Hart Dugtell COIItributing writer Tragedy struck the '92 presidential election Tuesday as renegade <Jandidate and Union College s:tudent Dug Bartell and his mnning mate Hobbes were attacked at a campaign rally in llis hometown of Rome N '{. . Hobbes was kiUed and Barteli seri,ously wounded in the attack which authorities: say was orchestrated by a band of nomadic conservati·ve Republicans. Kantennan,. in a desperate attempt to san: the cartoon i'egend, dmre directly into the line of fire and took several bullets in the head. Dootors found no damage. a getaway car parked ncar the rally sighl. The car was later identified as belonging to Jen Manna, a known political conspirator. When Manna 1 s house was surrounded and pol icc threatened to make her confess the identity of the gunmen, she panicked and swallowed soccer balls until a. coma. wal'; induced~ Random Obnoxious Thoughts It was 3pproximately 3:06 p.m. as Bartell was reaching the crescendu of his kiss-ass speech \r'hen the crowd of nearly 250;()00, (wooed there by the promise of cash giveaways}, heard shouting break the a.ir of beleaguered respect. Moments later chaos was provoked as witnesses say the three gun men pulled semi- automatic weapons from their overcoats and opened fire on the unsuspecting ticket. Bartell diodn't hear the shots initially as he continued to deliver his speech, apparently mystified by the sound of his own voice. Hobbes. however, felt the immediate brunt of the attack, absorbing most of the first barrage of bullets into his soft, orange, doth-covered body. Stuffing a11d thread were blown everywhere. Sec·urity agent Neil At this.. point, campaign officials surrounded Dug. A second round of gunfire ensued, this time accompanied by a barrage of Australiart poison blow-darts. Campaign directors Doug Winsh.op, Patrick O'Meally, and Joe SuJHvan w.ere hit as well as Bartell himselJ. Winshop, O'MeaHy, and Sullivan aH escaped with injuries to their hind-quarters and have since been released from the hospital. Bartell, however, suffered extensive damage to his ego and remains in critical condition. Rescues immediate rushed the platform and tried to save the animated carnivore, leaving Bartell and the others to die. Their revival attempts were in vain, however as he had lost too much cotton to survive. Hobbes passed away at 3: 12 p.m .. Doctors turned the i r attentions now to Bartell, who was diagnosed as being 80% brain dead, or, somewhere between Dan Quayle and Ned Walley. Upon learning tb.at Bartell hadn't received any real injury to h.is head, they said \really?\, and left to play golf. In the mad-scramble after the attack the gunmen escaped via When F.B.I. agents heard that their main witness was no longer conscious, they decided to scrap the whole search for the gunmen.

Sounds a bit like Ross Perot in July, doesn't it? We can now only hope that those who were willing to Dig Dug will now Dig Bill. Hobbes would have wanted it that way. Dug sends his thanks to those who supported his run over the last six weeks. I, uh- rathcr he. thought it wa.:; run. ~------------------------------------------------------------------------~ Erin M. O'Neil Features Writer To the reader: About an hour ago, I finished this article. I thought it was great. file best I'd ever written, perhaps. I was all ex:cited to print it out and show it to my roommates, when my disk said it was irretrievable. How pissed am I? I cannot even explain. So here I go, trying to rewrite what I already wrote an hour ago. Somehow I don't think it will be quite as good. I was in a much better mood at the time. Try to understand. AAAAAHHHHHHHH!!·!! !.!! What can 1 write about? What should ;I write about? What if I write about nothing. But I guess by writing about nothing, I'm actually writing :about somethillg. So here I go! I'm writing about something! I never claimed to be normal. If :you lmow me, <Or if you are a generally happy person, you will understand this article. If you don't like it, I don't like you either! I also never claimed to be mature. I'm NOT! I'm not trying to please you or anyone dse by writi11g this article. Dear Uncle Edna :SO THERE! So here I am, writing and sitting, ~itting and writing about nothing. lBabbling on to myself. I'm in · a bad mood. Uncle Edrla is a weekly column written by a Union College sltl~ent. Edfla answers real questi,n.s from real people and can be,-wched aJ box 83. Dear Unc:le Edna, If everyone in a class is failing but you are failing with a hig;her average than everyone else, does that mean that you are- in fact succeeding? -potential dropout Dear dropout, If a boat full o f people simks and you are the last to drown, then do you in fact survive? In other words, congratul='ltions, you are a valedict()rian am on g idiots. Dear Unde Edna, My boyfriend seems so far abm.e all the other guys here at Uni<.n This makes me nervous. Wll.at do you think? -JD Dear JD, A wise man one e said to beware of a m:an among sheep, especially if he isnft wearing 'pants. Dear Uncle Edna, I live in Davidson and haven't been able to get any hot water for a shower. My RA hasn't been able to get anywhere with this problem. How can r get this problem fixed? -Coid Dear Cold, I'm sorry, but $23,90.. isn't enough to boil water. For more information on tllis problem, call 1 - 8 0()- lnOneEar-OutTheOther. Dear Uncle Edna, I have this major problem. If I am walking around campus and smell a barbecue, i can't help but ,immediately remove my shirt and play volleyball while eating barbecued chicken. Girls love it They really dig hlc, but it is beginning to get in the way of my studies. I'll be in my room studying and hear the guys playing and immcdiatd y drop everything, grab the charcoal an join the fun. What should I do? -Hugh Heffner Dear Hugh, Actually, no I'm not, I lied. I j)tobably should be, but I'm 11ot. I'm feeling rather h~peractive today. actually. Yes, I am. Just a tad bit rambunctious. Is there I really d o n ' t ' understand your dHemtma. :o~omething wr<Jng with that? Maybe I'm alS()a bit defensive. So what? Damon Keller is always telling me to take a 'Valium. Why? So I have a lot more energy tbat the average Union student. So? Like tllat's so hard? I don't need a mouthful of dip to relax:. I d()ll't want to rem! Don't give me no sedative to calm me down! No way! NO VALIUM!!! NO V ALlUM FORME!!! Volleyball. Topless. Barbee ue. Ch lcs. Sounds a bit like heaven. However, I would like to know exactly how you play volleyball and eat BBQ ~hicken. Doesn't the chicken get in .the way. Dear Uncle Edna, Sometimes in class when I'm wearing sweatpants I daydream about my girlfriend and get an embarrassing blood flow. The situation is made even worse when I'm asked to go to &:he board. What should I do? -PU Dear PU, To alleviate y()ur \little\ problem, imagine George Bush standing in his boxer shorts. T II at should quench any horny instinct. I guess I have a lot of stuff t<J do. You know. mid-terms ': and such. I thillk people use mid-terms and fi:lals as an ex:cuse to be in a bad mood. Why is that? Why would one want to be in a bad mood? This has always perplex:ed me. Cheer up! Feel better[ If I see you and you're ill a bad mood, I :: am going to t01ture you with my hyperactivity until you want to cram a bottle of Yalium down my- tll.roat! You probably already want to. t'IE ~A NE\IJ PI Tal- If~ IIAl.~ WAI( @!::TWEEN IIW FA~\~j.,[.. AND MY . c.u~vee,a.~~;.. Good! Maybe I'm coming across as obnoxious, but why should I have to justify myself to you? I'm not trying te make you happy! I've always loved the phrase \coming across\. since my mother told me it's how they used to say, \having sex\ in the days of her youth. Interesting, eh? Do you think I'm obnoxious? I don't care! I like being obnoxious! My roommate is asleep in the other room as I write this. Is that my obnoxious side calling to me, saying to go in the room, tum the stereo up real loud, and jump on her head? Yes, it is! And I would do it if I weren't so into writing this article! So yes, I am obnoxious sometimes, and I'm damn proud of it! Do you have a problem with that? If you don't like this , just do me a favor and turn the page. I don't want your ugly, disapproving face staring at my naked words! Get your dirty hands off my article! Go tell your friends how obnoxious I am! Go ahead! For everyone else, thank you for sticking with me. Just remember, I am not trying to please you in any way. I'm just going to sit here and write until I have enough to make an article. Stay i1 you'd like. Pull up a chair. I just noticed tbat I've been using an absurd amount of exclamation marks. Does that mean that I am exclaiming? Yes, I guess it does. EXCLAMATION MARK!!!!!!!! I love you exclamation mark! You know what else I like that I don't get to do very often? Hold on, I'll show you: -' !@#$%\&*0_- +=f\}] { [:;\'?/>.< !! ! ! !!! ! ! ! ! !! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!. Those symbols always look so nice there on the keyboard, but we so rarely get to actually use them. I'm so glad I was able to share them with you. What?! Do you think I'm weird now? Somewhat bizarre? I DON'T CARE!!! Not today! I don't care what anyone thinks today! Can you tell? Anyway. I realize that I may be wasting your time with all this mindless chatter, but I don't feel badly, because if you really needed this time, you wouldn't be reading my article. So for those of you who actually stayed (thanks. Mr. D.) with and enjoyed this article, thank you for your patronage. Just remember, I wasn't trying to please you. Done.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 15, 1992 • PAGE 18 Water Polo • • • Wo111et1's Soccei· And They're Off! Wi11ds Dow11 by Lee Schachter Staff Writer The Union water polo team got off to a great start in the· 1992 Mid-Atlantic Conference League Tournament this past weekend. This two weekend tournament involves eight teams- Union, Hartwick, Colgate, Cornell, Buffalo State, Lehman, Columbia, and RPI. Union hosted the tournament, and the team ended this first weekend at 3-1. Hartwick came in first at 3-0 while Union tied Colgate for second. It was an exciting, hard-fought weekend of water polo. The tournament opened bright and early on Saturday morning when Union went up against RPI, last year's tournament winner. Union's starters were Sven Zabka. Scott Bowden, Geoff Wolfe, Dave Lunianski, Dave Robison, and Chris Y ousey, with Dimitri Konan in goal. Union got off to a great start and held it,. dominating the game the whole way, and won by the final score(){ 14-10. \DEFENSE. was the team's cheer, and it set the tone for the game by causing lots_ of turnovers andl then c~nverting them to goals! on offense. That was the story· of Union's weekend. Union's next game was against Columbia, and with a large crowd on hand, the team shelled Columbia, 22-9. The team algo found lots of support on the bench, as freshmen Seth Sealfon and Chris Riley each made an impact, Chris getting four goals and Seth winning a sprint~ which is a faceoff involvillg a race to the middle of the pool for tile ball. It was a full team effort. Union's next two games were the two hardest, against Colgate and Hartwick. Against Colgate~ the team was down 4- 3 at halftime. The rally cry of \DEFENSE\ worked again as the defense created many tumovers. This led to Y ousey starting the second half by scoring the first three goals, and the team starting the half by going on a 9-l run to take a 12-5 lead. Union hung on to Rangers Continued . • • winning goal in the Rangers' opener against the Capitals in Landover, Maryland, a 4-2 victory. If the Rangers have any problem, it is that they are over-loaded with talent at center, right wing and goalie. The Rangers now have Mike Gartner, Tony Amante, Aleksei Kovalev, and Paul Broten at right-wing, not to mention goons Joey Kocur and Tie Domi, who probably wont be seeing much ice time with ~ovalev here. No team in the i'eague has a list of talented names, even close to the Rangers except maybe for the RedWings who the Rangers would not have to meet until the finals. Though they do play in the toughest division in hockey, there is no question · that they will finish high in the division, thus making the playo ·s. Only the Penguins seemmgly comp&re to the Rangers in ability, but this year they will fall victim to Mario Lemieux's six million dollar ego, as well as too much hype. Remember, that the Penguins struggled just to get past the Islanders into last years playoffs, and barely finished in a 3r<J place tie with New Jersey. They exploded in the playoffs, because of extraordinary efforts put forth by players like J agr, Ron Francis, Rick Tocchet and Ulf Sammuelsson, and because of exc.,dlent coaching, but the Penguins are over-rated talent- wise. Nevertbeless, the Rangers always have a tough time with Pittsburgh in the post-season. The Rangers certainly have the'talent to win this year, and with good coaching and· the right administrative moves they will Pittsburgh's trade for tough, gritty goal-scorer Rick Toccltet really pushed them over the top last year. By March, the Rangers will have assessed their weaknesses, and if they use their wealth of resources to make the trade which will fill any remaining holes, tile talent and experience sho11ld carry them through. One situation that must be resolved though is the goalie problem. The Rangers have two excellent starting goal- tenders in Mike Richter and John VanBiesbrouck, which is fine for tbe regular season in case ()De is injured, but switching goalies does not work in the playoffs. Coach Roger Neilson must either trade ()ne goalie or pick one and stick witll him. Both Richter and VanBiesbrouck · play m11ch better when they . play consistently instead of having to look over the shoulders to see if they will be replaced if they perform poorly. There is no excuse for having goal-tending problems in the playoffs when you have 2 goalies this good. Look for Neilso11 to manage this situation much better this win 12-10. Against Hartwick, the score went back and forth all game. This time defense was amazing on both sides, as both defenses worked to get turnover after turnover. A 4-3 halftime lead turned into a 6-4 lead in the second half, bot Hartwick ·Came raging back to score the next three goa:Is and . take a 7-6 lead for themselves. An exchange of goals led to an 8-7 score late in the game, and then the defenses became even more stingy as Hartwick held on to win by that score in an exciting battle. Seaso11 By the numbers, Lunianski led the team with 14 goals, Wolfe had 12, Yousey with 11, and Bowden had nine as he won 14 out of 15 sprints and the team won 15 out of 16~ As mentioned the defense was superb all around. The team is hoping to continue its success. this weekend at RPI for the' second part of the tournament. So come on over for a short' road trip this weekend at RPI: and cheer on the team. Underratedly, it's really pretty rough out there and it's really exciting too. See you there! spring than he did last year. Well, the Rangers are the favorites to win their first championship since 1940. The pressure to win is tremendous. but Mark Messier has already experienced it all in Edmonton, and he will provide poise and By Ron Birnbaum . · Contributing Writer With two-thirds of its season complete, the Girls' Varsity Soccer team has a 3-6- 1 record for its efforts. Headed by Coach Suzanne Pedone for the fifth consecutive season, the Union squad is outshooting its opponent almost two to one, and has twelve cumulative goals off eight assists. Starting goalie Jen Manna has only let up fourteen total goals which have been offset by eighty-nine total saves. The team alternated a win for a loss for its first five outtings, starting with a close overtime defeat by key rival Albany State (2-1) in the opening away game. This led to an initial 2-3 record. After travelling to Siena for a 3.;0 leadership to the rest of the team. But this is the NHL, and you never know what will happen. And who is to say that the Ranger curse is not strong enough to thwart even this team's efforts. I can'tbelp but believe in the curse, so 1' d like Tired of dorm laundry rooms? win, the team returned home to face Binghamton (1-0) and Russel Sage (3-1) and then away again to Oneonta (2:-1). At home it gained a victory versus Vassar (2-1) and 1ied with Skidmore in an overtime game (1-1). Unfortunately, three away games following against St. Lawrence, Hartwick, and Plattsburgh :saw the women hooters defeated. Still, for most of the defeats suffered by the squad, the team has only lost by one g-oal, keeping the aggressor at bay. Upcoming in the schedule are home games versus RP1, at 6:30 tomorrow evening, and Middlebury at 2:00 on Tuesday next week.

A wise man once said that \it will be a cold day in Hell when the Buffalo Bills lose two in a row.\ Well, that guy is probably frozen at about 150 degrees below zero, because the Bills are 4-2, and in second place behind the Dolphins, the only undefeated team left in the NFL (5-0). Another surprise is Washington, the defending Super Bowl Champions, who are 3-2, one game behind the Eagles and the Cowboys. Everyone knows that in order to be a playoff contender, one has to be able to win on the road. Well, both Redskin losses came on the road to two divisional rivals (the Cardinals and the Cowboys). Although it's early, winning away from home and against divisional opponents has become a mixture- gone-sour for the Redskins. However, they are a completely different team at home, where they sent the Broncos into oblivion on Monday night, 31-3. Football is a strange game, isn't it? So, who is the best in the NFL? Record-wise, Miami is 5-0; but what about the NFC? One can say the Eagles, who buried the Cowboys last Monday night with their number one ranked defense in the league. This past week, however, saw their secondary picked apart like a tree full of ripe apples (at the hands of Kansas City, 24-17). Dallas, on the other hand, received\' their first shutout since 1988 at the hands of the Seattle Seahawks, 27-0. Next week will pair up Dallas and Kansas City, two teams with very potent offenses. If the Cowboys win, then who is better, Dallas or Philadelphia? This will most likely be decided two weeks from now, when the two rivals clash once again, but this time, it will be in the quasi-enclosed Irving Stadium in Dallas, Texas. Wait! There's still more . . . What about San Francisco, the team who, at 5-1, leads the league in :points scored. Later in the season, they will face off against the Dolphins, and a win there could very well establish them as the best in the league. That's a long way off, though . . . So, amidst the oligarchic state which the NFL is in at the :present time, there is no one dominating force. Three or four teams could make valid arguments, but the only way that it will be decided will be in the last week in January. Oh, and by the way, don't expect the Bills to lose three in a row.

Rangers Hope 53rd Time is a Charm by HaiPoret Co-Sports Editor The New York Rangers opened their 1992-93 hockey season last Thursday night with one thought in mind: that they must, and will win the Stanley Cup which has eluded them for the last 52 years. However, despite the fact that this is probably the most talented Ranger team of all time, history tells us that it will take a lot more than pure skill to break the curse which has haunted Ranger teams and fans for years. And if you don't believe in the supernatural or jinxes and curses, you are probably not a Ranger fan, most of whom have suffered through too much agony to call it chance. In addition, if you are an avid sports fan in general, you will know that the Ranger jinx is nothing in comparison to the curse of the Chicago Cubs, who haven't won a World Series since Teddy Roosevelt was President. And who can forget the Red Sox losing the 1986 World Series, which was practically in the bag, when a slow-moving ground ball rolled through 1st baseman Bill Buckner's legs, allowing the Mets to make a miraculous comeback and go on to win the series. There are four retired Red Sox numbers on the outfielrl wall in Fenway Park, for Ted Williams, Jimmy Foxx, Bobby Doerr and Carl Yastremski. The numbers appear on the wall: 9 4 1 8. Coincidentally. the Red Sox have not won a World Series since September 4, 1918. And how many football fanatics do not know about the \immaculate reception\? In the 1972 AFC divisional playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers trailed the Oakland Raiders by 6· points with a minute left and \'\\ had the ball with 4th down and 16 yards to go. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass which bounced off the helmet of Raider defensive back Jack Tatum all tile way across the field and seemed to be falling incomplete, when the ball seemingly \appeared\ in Steeler running-back Franco Harris' hands at the far sideline, from where he proceeded to run the ball into the end-zone for the winning touchdown. There has always seemed to be some mysterious force beyond our comprehension that shapes the outcome of sporting events (or controls the success or failure of certain teams) .. The Rangers won their 3rd and last Stanley Cup in 1940, defeating the Toronto Mapleleafs four games to two. After finishing 27-11-10, in second place behind the Boston Bruins, this talented team defeated the Bruins in six games and then emerged victorious from an exciting series with Tcronto, winning all three overtime games in the finals, including the last two. On April13~ 1940, this historic team sipped from Lord Stanley's cup, without a clue of what a cmel fate would befall their Ranger descendants~ .. (! just thought I'd inform all the .clueless hockey fans about tile 1940 Rangers so they'll have some idea of what they are saying when they chant \1940\). For those of you who would call it bad luck or just bad teams that have contributed to the Rangers' winning dro11ght, please read on. From 1940 to 1943, there were only 7 teams in the league, and one was the N.Y. Americans who were perpetual losers, and folded after the 1943 season. From 1944 to 1968. there were only six teams in the NHL. This meant that four teams made the playoffs and you only had to win 2 serles to win the Cup. Over this time period, Detroit won 5 times, Montreal and Toronto won 10 times each, and even the Blackhawks and . Bruins managed to each win a Cup: notic:e that all other five teams are mentioned as winners i11 this pre-expansion era. The fact that the Rangers could not win 2 consecutive play-off series once over a 28 year stretch is unbelievable. All a team had to do was finish in 4th place out of 6 teams to make the playoffs. The odds of · the average team not winning once in this period are less than 1%, so even if the Rangers were the worst team over that stretch, it is still amazing. The Rangers• best chance came in 1950, when led by Hart Trophy (MVP) winner Chuck Rayner, the Rangers held a three games to two lead over Detroit in the finals. But of course, destiny reared its ugly head as Detroit came storming back to win the last 2 games and the series. S:ince the NHL expanded, the first expansion coming in the 1967-68 season, the Rangers have not come very close. In 1978-79, the \Broadway Blues\ only finished in third place. 25 points behind the President Trophy winners (for the league's best record), the NY Islanders, but defeated the Islanders and Flyers in the playoffs only to be crushed by Montreal in the finals, as the Canadiens won their 4th Cup in a row. In 1986, hope glimmer~d again as the Rangers upset Patrick Division rivals Washington and Philadelphia to reach the Conference finals, but again they were blown off the ice by the Canadiens. Finally, at the end of last season, when the Rangers were on fire and ready to make a strong run for the Stanley Ct!p, the Hockey Gods FOOTBALL FALTERS SECOND WEEKINAROW .by Dagan La Corte Associate Sports Editor For the second week in a row, the Dutchmen came up on the short end of the stick, as they lost to the Great Danes of SUNY Albany. Albany was able to overcome a 17-9 deficit in the fourth quarter and eventually win the game by the score of 23-17. Union's luck started off poorl)', as they fumbled the initial kickoff which enabled Albany to score on their first possession. Albany tried for the two point conversion, but was UllSUCCessful. The Dutchmen marched down the field on their next possession. A 12-yard run by Chad LaBonte combined with a 9-yard run by Chris Irving, helped to set up quarterback Brian Harris' 13-yard touchdown pass to Dave Sodegren. The Dlltchmen took the 7-6 lead, and continued to dominate the fJJSt half. Later in the quarter Chris Irving ran the ball 19-yards for a touchdown; and tile Dutchmen led 14-6. The defense of Union in the first .half was also excellent. After a penalty to Union, Albany had lst and used all their .powers to summon up a massive players strike, long enou!Jh to break the Rangers' momentum, and leave them to attempt to pick up where they left off. But even the strike did not seem to be enough to stop such a talented team. The Rangers struggled through a seven game series witb the Devils, and actually held a 2-1 lead over the Penguins and led late in game 4. Was it not fate that goal-tender Mike Richter, who had otherwise played flawlessly, would let in a 65- foot Ron Francis shot to tie the game, and that Captain, and 4- time Stanley Cup winner, Mark goal from the Dutchmen 7- yard line. Craig Mosia and Jaimy Farnan were able to thwart the Great Danes' offense; and linebacker Marco Lainez sacked Albany's quarterback which forced them to settle for a field goal. Late in the third quarter, the Dutchmen appeared to have the game in the bag when Greg Harrison kicked a 26- yard field goal. Unfortunately, the Dutchmen's good fortune ended, and Albany was able to come back during the final quarter. 'The turning point for Albany occurred when quarterback Jaan Laap ran the ball from his own 40-yard line into the end zone to cut the Dutchmen's lead to 17-16. Later in the quarter, the Great Danes broke through Union's defense and took the lead 23- 17. With 1:30 left in the quarter, Albany hammered the nail into Union's coffin, when Ken Breland intercepted a Brian Harris pass which was intended for Gene Ray. The loss to Albany lowers Union's record to 3-2, and all but ends the Dutchmen's playoff ho~. Messier would make a rookie- like error in overtime which led to Pittsburgh's winning goal, and let the series get away? This season, the Rangers are even better than last year, mainly due to the addition of Russian superstar Aleksei Kovalev at right wing, and Phil Bourque, who brings his aggressive style and winning experience from Pittsburgh, at left wing.

New~ Editor Thirty-five Uoion College students have been declined the right to register to vote by Schenectady County because the local Board of Elections classifies Union students with Post Office Box addresses as temporary residents. The county Democratic Election Commisgioner, Robert Brehm, claims that students who live on camp11s cannot be classified as full tirne residents because they do not have access to a kitchen, and they cannot be evicted. Travis Plunkett, NYPIRG's senior legislative associate, criticized Schenoctady County by saying \Yo11ng people should be encouraged to vote but the message that Schenectady is sending to Union College students is 'Don't bother.\' A recent case involving Skidmore College students ended with the students being granted the rigb.t to vote in Saratoga Spri11gs. It is conceivable that Union students will charge Schenectady County with violating their constitutional rights. Arthur Eisenberg, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, claims that \The disqualification of students just because they live in a dormitory is unconstitutional.\ Eisenberg added,. ''For students who eat and sleep and carry on business in their college community, and if they don't intend to return to their parental home, then denying them the right to register and vote (in the college community) is unconstitutional.\ Brehm, althougiJ he claims to have compassio11 for the Union students, will only change the rules \If we are ordered by a court to do this\. The bill which Eisenberg is fighting to overt11m is the so- called \Biondo Bill\. The bill, which was signed into law in the early 1970s, makes it very difficult for students to vote in the community in which their college is located. .

In my view (and apparently in the views of officials in all but four other counties in New York - and eve11 those counties are far less restrictive than Schenectady), it is wrong - dead wrong - to bar absolutely students at Union ftom voting when their co11nterparts at 222 other coDeges in New York have that right. If students residing on the Unicn campus cannot vote beca11se they are deemed to be simply passing through the community, then why is it that Union students are rebuilding homes on Hamilton Hill, why are they raising money for local charities, why are they student- teaching in Schenectady schools and tutoring elementary students after school, why are they cleaning up Schenectady's parks an<l highways and streets, why are they volunteering in hospitals, why are they working at the battered women's shelter, wlly are they making programs like Big Brothers/Big Sisters sucii a success, and why are they spending millions of dollars an n,u'aliy in Schenectady?

• Young Adult With AIDS Opens Awareness Week Student Forum Spotlight by Alexander Sklavos Student Forum. President their own, newly renovated area, and would clear Alumni gym's weight room for recreational use. by Veronica Rogers Associate News Editor AIDS Awaren.ess Week comes to a close tomorrow evening with Comedienne Suzi Landolphi performing at 8:00 p.m. in Memorial Chapel. The beginning of this important week began early Monday morning at a breakfast held in Hale House. This breakfast, although targeted for 16-25 year olds, was mostly attended by faculty and citizens of Schenectady, many of'whom are health care workers. The low student turnout didn't deter the speakers from delivering their important message. The two speakers were 20 year old Henry Nichols who at the age of 10 was infected with the HIV virus through a blood infusion and his older sister Jennifer. Jennifer spoke first about the ever~growing numbers of people aged 16-25 who are acquiring HIV. She noted how one of the biggest misconceptions about AIDS is that people assume that AIDS victims look different' or sick, and that they must have very little money. Misconceptions like these are what get many people in trouble, especially younger adults who are experimenting with sex, and can often be involved in risky sexual behavior. Many of these teenagers think they are invulnerable. Young adults who think that because their partner looks healthy, or says that he/she is healthy very easily can be exposing themselves to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Jennifer then introduced her brother Henry who came up to give his perspective on AIDS and how it has affected him. Henry has been a hemophiliac all his life and has had to get blood infusions whenever he has gotten hurt. Throughout his early childhood, until he contracted HIV. Henry had about 350 infusions of blood. which exposed him to about 6 million different donors. Back in the early 80's blood banks didn't think about the risks of contaminated blood. AIDS hadn't been fully exposed yet, so all the hemophiliacs and others in need of blood world- wide were open to possible infections. Not until 1985 was there an HIV antibodv test available to screen blood for traces of HIV. Henry lived with HIV for three years before the doctors discovered the virus in his body. In 1985 at the age of 13 Henry was told he had HIV. His family decided to keep it a secret from everyone outside of the immediate family. The Nichols family was scared that people would burn their house down, or ridicule the household. It was hard for Henry to keep it a secret, especially when he wo11ld hear AIDS jpkes in conversations. He didn't tell anyone though, for fear of his family's well being. Henry finally went public with this disease in March of 1991 after doing his Eagle Scout project on an AIDS awareness program. Right away he was recognized thro1Jghout the C()untry. Magazines ,published stories about Henry. Then his family decided it was time to take his message about AIDS on tb.e road. They traveled across the country to speak to 16~25 year olds, the age group in which the infection rate is doubling. In his message he spoke about being angry and hateful abollt the disease that is destr()ying his immune system. He said that he has accepted it, though. Henry stated that he didn't want and wouldn't let himself feel helpless alxlut the disease. He said 11 f'm not afraid of AIDS, or anything AIDS brings me, as long as I don't have to face it by myself' His sister, rigb.t along side him spoke of how their family . sticks togeJher an.d is_ always ·' tbere for Henry. ·. . , Henry at Unioll and throughout the country has : stressed important ways to avoid HIV. To avoid HIV people need to protect themselves. Abstinence is the only way to ensure absolute safet)'. Since in many cases abstillence is not a option, it is imperative that people practice safe sex, not only by .using a condom .. but by limiting their sexual partners and fully discussing their partner's sexual past. Times are different now, and poople who think tb.at they can be thoughtless about who they have sex with next are most at risk. Jenllifer and Henry stressed the importance of blood donating. So many are in need and tile procedure does not put the donor at risk. The Nichols believe citizens also need to get politically invoJved.. Although the government has said in the past they m-e doing all they can for AIDS prevention and research, the n11mbers of AIDS victims ruis quadrupled while the budget AIDS research has decreased steadily. The death toll for J\IDS victims is about 150,000. Henry also sa:id that pr,ograms should be instituted in schools, while Jennifer added that AIDS education should start · at a young age so that prolo11ged exposure might condition kids to the fact that they need to be very ·careful with tlleiJ: future actions. Tbe Nichols believe the media is a large problem because of their portrayal of sexual behavior on TV. Television viewers are exposed to a lot more sexual activity on . TV •then they used to :be. The · ima8es that are being .projected · make it seem safe to engage in · casual or unprotected sex. If • young viewers are exposed to this for a prolonged period of · time, they wiU think they couldn't be at risk for AIDS. :Parents are showing a growing concern for what their children are watching everyday. They ' are fearing for their children's lives because of what the media projects. Attempts to get the media to cut down on sexual exposure is a hard thing. The media knows that they attract more viewers if they include more appealing aspects, so they are not willing to cut down on their material that attracts the attention. Dealing with the media will be an ongoing struggle that the public will have to continue to participate in. · Henry ended his message by telling the. audience that he doesn't want people to treat him differently because he has AIDS. Often doctors and other people treat AIDS patients as if they are \fragile like glass\. Cont. on page 3 Homecoming weekend, along with bringing Ahmmi back to Union, brougttt the autumn Trustee meetings. The main topic was ftxing tNilat'needed to :be fixed at Union, and creating a setting at Union that is more conducive to academics. the trustees .·realized the immediate need to upgrade tile condition of many of the Greek houses. They realize that all students deserve equal standard of living conditions. The ,trustees also announced their li£t of priorities for building on campus: 1) Y ulman Theater - the trustees envision Yulman Theater as an academic theater. and a necessity for this campus, 2) The Nott Memorial, and 3) Schaffer Library. This list may be disturbing to some. Many think that the library should be at the top of the :priorities list. After all, if we desire a greater academic setting, shouldn't that start with the :library? The trustees also discussed the curling area under the rink, and the possibility of making it into a varsity w~ight room. This would ~ive the varsity athletes Once again Chet's dominated the discussion in the meeting. After the Town Meeting this past Thursday, the foremost thought in our minds was whether or not we should try .and move Chet's to another location. The Student Forum voted in favor of moving Chet's to the Rathskellar. We feel this will give Chet's the atmosph~re it needs. This does not necessarily mean that Chet's will move. We need approval from many different places, and we also have to see if fire codes will allow a ,pub to be in the Skellar. For fll1ther information come to our next meeting on Monday 10/26 at 6:30P.M. Notes: Petitions ru.re still available for 3 Freshman reps., and one Senior rep. to the Student Forum. Petitions are available in the Student Activities office (room 408 C.C.), and are due on Monday 10/26. Elections will be held on Friday 10/30 in the College Center. There will be a Faculty/Student \Town Meeting\ on Thursday 10/29 at 11:30 a.m. in the Memorial Chapel. Ham Radio Donation to Schenectady Museum ----------------------- by Buffy Rubenstein Concordiensis Staff Imagine sitting in New Zealand and being able to pick up a signal from the Union College radio station. In the age of high technology it is not hard to imagine. But this was possible back in the 1940's because of Ham Radio. What is Ham Radio you may ask? Ham Radio is the communication through radio waves at a special frequency. At one time on the Union College Campus extensive communication with the rest of the world was achieved through these radio waves. Union students could pick up a signal from almost anywhere in the world on W2UC, the original campus radio station When a student picked up a signal they would send a postcard or letter to the sender and the cycle would continue. Ham Radio provided the Union student with a pen-pal gateway to the world. The Ham Radio Tower for the original Union College radio station, W2UC, rests on the spot near North College, overlooking Jackson's Gardens, where the new Yulman th.eater w111 t;e built later ·this year. Instead of demolishing the one hundred foot tower, it will be donated to the Schenectady Museum. A reciprocal agreement bas been arranged whereby the museum will make the tower and museum facilities available to Union College students. According to Dean Mammola, the Dean of Students. the tower has rarely been used during the past few years due to the dwindling interest in Ham Radio at Union College. In addition, the Ham Radio facilities in Haskin's Lab have deteriorated due to the lack of interest. When the location of the new theater was announced, the Schenectady Museum expressed interest in taking the tower and preserving it for use. The Museum has a11 active Ham Radio operators group that will use the tower. It -will be placed on the roof of tile museum. The Union College Community has been concerned about helping the Ham Radio station succeed at the College. But due to the limited student participation, the efforts have tur.ned to helping the Schenectady communj ty insteaa. Due to his interest in Ham Radio, Professor Fairchild of the Mathematics Department implemented the reciprocal agreement with the Schenectady Museum. The donation is important because it will help keep the history of W2UC alive. W2UC got its start back in the 1920's. This era was the start of radio broadcasting in the United States. It is amazing to realize that W2UC was one of the first broadcasting stations anywhere in the ·· country. W2UC was lrnow around the country for the concerts played over its airwaves. The headline \Wireless Music Sent by Union\ highlighted many papers throughout the country. In a time when Union College is nearing its Bicentennial, it is important to ~understand 'the history that enabled us to come here. The history of Ham Radio and the 'international communication it provided is art important facet of this institution's capabilities. Union . was ahead of its time with these technological. bi:eakthroughs. Now the Schenectady Museum will continue to· preserve our historv while Union helus them. ' • JUST VOTE Your Vote Counts

Mulholland stated that the relief effort would not have been possible if not for the generosity of Liberty Travel, which got Union students extraordinary rates, despite that the trip takes place during peak ·season.

Areas that have not been directly visited by the relief efforts are .. having problems getting clean water and getting rid of raw .sewage. The relief effort win allow residents of badly damaged areas to search for daycare services and to receive food, according to Mulholland. The residents will feel more free to leave their houses while the houses are being rebuilt. Mulholland is a Ph.D. student in Health Systems Administration at Union College. He is also the founder of Quality of Life International. Henry emphasizes that they are still the same people even though they are infected. His personal speech was an informative and powerflll message of the need for education and willingness from society to control and fight the disease. The AIDS epidemic is not going away anytime soon. People need to realize that it is a part of everyone's lives. Convincing themselves they are not at risk only spreads the AIDS virus. Henry got it at a time when the risks were unknown to him, but now the public knows the risks and they still make themselv,es susceptible. Jennifer and Henry tried to dispel all the rumors there are about possible ways Campus Security Incidents Write for to contract IDV. Sex with an infected partner, drug use, and blood transfusions are the only ways to get the disease. The rumors that mosquito bites, kissing. and sharing can transmit the disease are fal.se. Jennifer and Henry in a subtle way tried to prove this l>y sharing one water glass during their speech. Henry's story was not an unusual one to hear, but as a person who is of average age of Union College students, bis story was one that students may be able to relate to.

Through his many involvements in public a.nd private sectors, Mr. Perot has demonstrated a rare a:bility to take decisive action to implement compelling plans. What about the 400 billion dollar deficit and the 4 trillion dollar national debt? Mr. Perot feels strongly that we must eliminate the debt and deficit, lifting the enormous burden that threate11s future generations. As he says, \We need to leave the American Dream intact for our children, [and] we can't have all these wonderful things [social programs] if we're broke.\ What about jobs? \We've got to protect the job base, That's where the taxes come from.

In a recent article, it was suggested that any informed voter should answer several basic questions before November 3. Accepting the proposed questions as providing an acceptable basis for evaluation of the two major candidates, I maintain that we cannot afford four more years of George Bush. America's best and brightest hopes lie with Bill Clinton. Is the candidate qualified for the job? Bush's resume is certainly long and distinguished- but we can. all agree that the most telling measure of a person's capacity · for leadersllip in the role of Chief Executive is that person's record as Chief Executive. The Persian Gulf War has been cited as the highlight of Bush's tenure as President. Few would disagree that his forging of a worldwide coalition and subsequent execution of the war against Iraq was.masterful indeed. But in order to obtain a clear picture of the nature of George Bush's leadership, one must examine his actions prior to and leading up to the war. A damning memo initialled by James Baker makes clear that prior to the war Bush baker had intentionally perverted the grain credits program- set up to help U.S. farmers- and turned it into a back door foreign aid source, contrary to the will of Congress. William Safire, the Pulitzer Prize winning conservative journalist, sums up Bush's knowledge and actions as follows. \Mr. Bush knew we were guaranteeing loans at an unacceptable risk to a borrower 1 who our Fed and Treasury private sector jobs in ·hli!; state warned would only ~pay upon . over the last four years· more receipt of larger loans.

Wade, when he ran for President in · 1980. But he subsequently . flip-flopped as Vice..:PJesident and President in order to suck up to the far right (Time. ' 10/5/92). It should be noted · that back when Mr. :Bush was in ·Congress, he was such an · ardent supporter of reproductive rights that his nickname on the Hill was 'rubber.s'. In one of Bush's most blatant falsehoods, Bush claims that he had forbidden all high- level exchanges with China following the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre- even as he secretly sent his top foreign policy aides to meet with Beijing's leaderS. Bush I.ikes to say that he is a strong sup-porter of human 'rights, but when they are violated by China he rewards them with most- favored-nation trading status. He did this with the knowledge that China used prison labor to produce items for export to the U.S. Apparently this is compatible with his concept of fair, free trade. This all smacks of a person concerned with· political expediency rather than someone who reacts from any deep-rooted sense of political integrity. Nex4 what will the candidate do in office? Oddly enough, the previous article discussed almost exclusively what the President had done in this past term. This is presumably because the author is unaware of Bush having any specific EDITING & More ~han 550 economists, 550 CEO's, and 9 Nobel Prize winning economists back Bill Clinton's plan to revitalize America. Bill Clinton and Al Gore have detailed their program for changing America in their book Putting People First. I recommend reading it. Republicans should brace themselves for a landslide of similar magnitude as that of Barry Goldwater in 1964. Bush ·will win no more than 12 and closer to six, mostly small states. The Senate will see an increase in Democratic seats from 57 to at least 60. A 60 member majority in the Senate will give the Democrats the power to shut off debate through a 'cloture' motion, depriving the Republicans of the ability to block legislation by filibustering. The GOP· will only pick up 16 seats in the House of Representatives despite favorable redistricting. This will leave the Democrats with 252 seats to 182 for the Republicans, with one independent. Welcome to the fringes of political influence. After your reprehensible, divisive national convention, you deserve it. On the brighter side for Republicans, if the Democrats don't do a hell of a job over the next four years, the America people will have no one to blame but the Democrats. Then the door will be wide open for Dan Quayle in 1996.

However, with s11ch intense focus 011 the specificity of the issues~ we are in danger of, as the saying goes, losing the forest for the trees. It is true that issues should be carefully considered, but not at the expense of our national character. Our founding fathers devoted much of their lives to fomulating a constitution which would protect the liberty and equality of Americans. Although. a perfe(t balance between these 1two ideas may never be realized, it was to be the goal of our legislators and citize:ns. While Americ.a is praised for the personal Iibert' it allows each perso11, that liberty was never meant to come at the expense of another's equality. Our present economic strife remains one of the pivotal issues for the next president, but it cannot be addressed separately from our social responsibilities to one anotlter, not to mentio11 the enviroonment. It is true that there ·is a fundamental diff~rence between the republican and democratic philosophies concerning this relationship between economic and social programs. Obviously~ the philosophy under which Ame~ica has functioned for the :past decade has not effectively woJjr.ed. The next :president will not be able to make the economy his fii'St priority witllont an equal attention to the needs of the people. Bill Cl·inton has always governed 0n a personal basis and is very attuned to the needs of his constituents~ By surrouOOing himself witl1 the pecple, such as he did at the seco11d ,presidential debate, he has become .more conscio11s of real people and the real problems. For the past twel've years George Bush has become detached from America. This was painfully evident in the second presidential debate whe11 be could not answer how the recession had effected him or anyone he knew personally. BHl Clinton has been in touch with the needs of our society and understands the need to invest ill the people. George Bush's pbilosophy of trickle down economics does not miraclltously enccurage people t() invest in their comm11nity once financially stable. This policy has unfortanately not benefited anyone, failing America's urban cities and rural towns. It is clear that there is another factor that is inextricably related to a stro11g economy, a strong carin~ c<>mmunity working together for everyone's benefit. The ilext president must not only work for a sound econornic policy, but must alsoclulnge the me mentality to the we mentality. If the past twelve years have prove11 anything, it is that witllout a sense of com mu~nit y, even a superp<>wer can wobble off a pedestal. You call can it trickle down re~ponsibility or leadership stresses societal involvement~ with pr0grams that encourage organizations and businesses t@ work with the communities they inhabit. We might ffnd an America we never thought we'd see. One where people can learn to come together for each other regardless of wealth, race, or religion. Is it not worth the chance? Bill Clinton has had hundreds of the best economic minds review both his economic and health care plans~ There are those who might object to certain aspects. but I for one have a hard time arguing with Nobel Peace Prize winners. Tlie best man for the next four years will be the one with the most innovative ideas and the most courage to follow through with them. Though numbers and statistics can be manipulated to favor any candidate, the future is the important issue. George Bush made it painfully clear that he is not interested or energetic enough to meet the challenge the next four years will bring. With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, history has shown that the most successful presidents have been active presidents, who take the lead on transferring the country. lt now seems evident that a healthy economy is inseparable from an interacting community. Bill Clinton will work for an America of which we can be proud. If you are not ha:ppy with the direction the country has moved, and you are not looking for another four years with Bush/Quale, and you think America has more potential than Bush accredits it, then Vote for BILL CLINTON and AL GORE and vote for Change.

FDA TARGETS NICOTINE PATCH COMPANY by Shields Day Business EdiLor The patch is back. After a lmtg three month lull advertisements for nicotin~ patches that help people quit smoking are back in a~un?ance. This past spring, mccune patch advenisements were so ubiquitous that it was almost impossible to find a magazine without at least two advertisements promoting the use of nicotine patches. Where did these patch advertisements go this summer? These advertisements were pulled out of circulation because they were under tough scrutiny by the Federal Drug Association (FDA) due to their misleading ad campaign. The patches alone do not help someone to quit smoking. Th~ nicotine patches only help qmtters by pre.yenting the withdrawal symptoms that smokers suffer from. If someone wearing the patch decides to smoke a cigarette while under the effect of the patch, the effects can be extremely serious - and possibly deadly! Since no advertisements relay this important information, the FDA is coming down hard on the three original patch companies: Ciba Geigy, Marion Merrell Dow, and American Cyanamid. Smokers choosing to use the patch to terminate their smoking habit are supposed to attend a class while they are on the patch. The seminar and patch together help someone quit smoking, but the FDA claims that nicotine patch ad :;arnpaigns neglect to mention the classes. The ad campaign leads smokers into thinking. that simply by buying a box .of patches and applying C>ne daily, they will be able to quit smoking. Many people who were using the patch and contintJcd to smoke have suffered serious medical problems. Of ·the many problems that have arisen from patch wearers who smoke, the most serious has been heart-attacks. Since there is no proof that the heart attacks have any relation to the patches, the FDA has not taken the product off the shelves. Last spring, the advertisements and hype were so successful in promoting the product, that there were not enough patches to go around. Store shelves were wiped clean of th~ patches. Sales have definitely suffered without the same intense advertising seen ·last spring, but this has given the producers time to restock their storerooms. The FDA wrote a letter to these companies this September stating that they must make it clearer in their advertisements that counseling must accompany the patch if quitters want to see any results. Even the doctors writing prescriptions for the patch were often unsure and/or confused about how to proper! y prescribe the drug. Some doctors were not even aware that they were supposed to tell thei·r patients to also seek counS;eling. In spite ()f the fact that the patch has teen going through a rough time, it is difficult to predict ho~,:~; well the patch will do in the kmg run. For those who find tJle patch successful, they will 11se it, quit .sm()king. and never need it again. For those whOt find it yet an,other ineffective gimmick tG help them quit, they will buy it once and Jtever buy it again. Since there is no long ru11 need ~or this product, many mvestors CJUestion jusl bow much this J>roduct will b-enefit these comJJanies. A quiclcglance at one of the three comjpanies producrng the patch, Marion Merrell Dow, shows the1t over the pas:t year the stock ilas sold at a h.igh of 39 and a l()w of 24. Cwrently, the stock ~is selling at 24 3/4. Although the current dip in price is probably due t() the recent FDA problems, the growth ]lOtential for this company does not seem too great. Such a huge dive in the price of tbe stock reflects that most of tile stock's valuation was due to the patch. Now that the FDA and investors are aware of tlle potential bazards involved with customers who ~mok~ while on the produc~. it IS unlikely that investO['S will ever value the patch so higllly. In fact, if a direct link between heart attacks and the patch can be made, llle patch may.end up as a detriment to all nicotine patch companies.

AUDITORIUM CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 22, .1992 $ PAGE S DOLLARS & SENSE by Byron Elson Contributing Writer Casualty losses are those that result from sudden . ' unexpected or unusual events, such as tornados, hurricanes, and even sever storms. The key word is \sudden\. Damage to ymrr property resulting from progressive deterioration does not qualify as a casualty loss. Other nondeductible property losses include termite damage, damages from rust or corrosion of the understructure of your house, or those that result form new construction near your property. Not all qualified casualty losses are limited to acts of nature. In certain situations, damage to your car in an accident may be considered a deductible loss. As with other casualty losses, a deduction is allowed only for uninsured losses. If you are covered by insurance, your eligibility for a casualty loss deduction is contingent upon your first making a timely insurance claim. Additional rules apply, so check.with a CPA. . If you deposited your money m a bank, credit union or another financial institution that later failed, you may elect to claim a casualty loss, rather than a nonbusiness bad debt, provided no part of your deposit is federally insured. .. ~J:\-:~-.-r:.~:::: : .. ,~ . ..: .. ~~ ... r ,[. \\.

Befor.e making a casualty loss {::laim, you must make an insli1ance claim, even if )IOU do not expect reimbursement. The amount of the loss is redu.ced by the mone,- you recerve from your insurance company. The deduction for eacll loss is then limited to the amount in excess of $100 pe1 loss occurrence, not per item. Be aware that the $100 limitation for each loss also applies to a husband and wife filing a joint retwn, even if each of the them sust4ined a loss from tile same casualty.

SCHOOL TIES A WINNER By,Thor Alexander Eeoander Conributing Writer Sherry LansiJl~, co-Producer with Stanle)' Jaffe(Fatal Attraction), says it all \Racism is based on notlling more than ignorance, and it's getting worse and worse and worse.\ Indeed, racism is a subject very relevant to the new movie School Ties. by Paramount. The focus is on David Greene, a higb school student and quarterback extrordinaire from · Scranton, P A. who is recruited by a Waspy, New England style boarding school to jolt their lagging program. Greene learns the way of the school very q11ickly, and hides his religioll, understanding the inherent bigotry of the place. A likable person, David makes friend quickly. buddying up with the most popular guy in the school. In the course of events. Greene run.s into conflict with his friend on the football field, ill tbe dance hall, and event11ally in the classroom. His religion is eventually discovered, and used against him as his friends, classmates an.d teammates all turn him away. The movie is directed by little· k11own Robert Mandel. and cast with unknowns. Apparently, Lansing and Jaffe were trying to imitate the casting policy of their 1981 drama Taps, where a young actor named Timothy Hutton led unknowns Tom Cruise and Sean Penn in a notable work. I doubt, however, that any these boys will bud into megastars. Except perhaps Randal Batinkoff, who was frrrn in this movie and even better in the Hollywood expose, T h e Player. Brendan Fraser, who plays Greene, was last seen as the goofy lead in Encino Man. While his performance was solid, he didn't have the edge to draw people to feel for him. You found yourself sympathizing for his situation, where a better actor would have had you sympathizing for him. The rest of the cast remained adequately in character. While I recommend School Ties, let me add that it was hard not to relate it to the private school hit Dead Poets Society. There were huge similarities in plot, and I was half expecting someone to kill themselves. Having said that, I give this movie a B+. It won't make you roll around with laughter, nor will it win any Academy Awards.. but it very entertaining and leaves you with a pointed disgust for racists. Definitely see it. It will be playing on campus next term, and when it does. sport the two bucks and enjoy yourself.

'This is not a long period of time, especially for those who have yet to come to a conclusion. There . is also the question of who would be the most qualified vice- , presidential candidate. The decisions we make concerning these questions will shape this country for at least the next four years. ' And the repercussions could last well into the 21st century. The first candidate is the incumbent, George Bush, who has tried to convince voters that he is the best candi<late in every way possible. It just seems that the majority of voters desire someone new in the White House. They don't care that the good ole' ·U.S.A. is actually doing quite well when compared to most other • industrialized Western countries, or that Mr. Bush has done a very • good job handling international disputes. They are simply sick of ·doing it his way, and want bim out. Bill Clinton, who seems to be the front runner in every major American: poll, promises everyone that he stands for change. What? Change. Wllat? CHANGE! (That was for those readers who missed all of the presidential debates and just wanted a · q\lick summary). And let's not forget tax and spend. (No , repetition necessary). The real question is: Do the American people really believe that all this change can be accomplished, or are they simply voting for the candidate they believe to be the lesser of two evils? However, there aren't j11st two evils. Magically, a third evil reappeared after mysteriously disappearing earlier this summer: Ross Perot. He's back, and he's gonna spend 60 million dollars out of his own pocket just to make sure the youth of today can still have a shot at the Amerkan dream tomorrow. He's a true businessman who wants to ~ave this country before we really llit troubled waters. In the Monday evening debate, he equated America with GM during the eighties. He had 750 million dollars invested in GM, and told the board that unless drastic restructuring measures were initiated immediately, the largest corporation in the world would soon find .itself in deep trouble. They wouldn't listen, and bought him out. H. Ross does not want this to happen again, and on an even larger scale. So he's back in the race. Whatever the American people listen to, how much are they really hearing, and what i~ actually being said? It is a very important duty to vote, but it is an increasingly difficult one .. There is so much infonnation out there about tile candidates, yet there is still so little. Do we really want to know that two of the three ca11didates are alleged to have had affairs? How about the fact that one smoked pot, but didn't inhale? The American people would just like to decide who would make the best President, but tile candidates and their campaign managers are not making this an , easy task.

Our experience is tllat the' professors at Unioll are very intelligent and veJ!Y capable teachers but few relate their passion for learning to students. The solution to the Respectfully Submitted, Da:ve Rosenblum '93 Lea Lewis '93 Sexism: I Tl1i11k Not!! To the Edit()r: I've never seriously thought about writing; an article for Concordiensis, but I was extremely bothered by an article entitled '\Sexism is alive and well as Union College.\ Let me prefac:e my article by saying I have nothing against . the writer (I ion't even know her) and certainly I have nothing again~t any women's movements, Sl!Ch as women's liberation, so please don't , . dismiss this atticle as one written 'by a male chauvinist. However, I <lo have many serious problems with the contents of the: article itself. My first pmMem is the plea for women to break the silence and not continue to \play the game.\ Tllis is a great suggestion, b11t in my opinion talk is cheap, ~s the old cliche goes, and ullless you act on your frustratkln nothing will change. Writing an article in Concordiensis definitely will not solve your dilemma. On the positive side. I was happy to see you included a disclaimer so as not to incriminate all males for injustices against females. Nevertheless, whik reading the article ovei again, even this frustrated me. It is extremely annoying because the speaking of are often t:he ones sitting behind a bar at 4:00 arn on a Saturday night, while those not fortunate en()ugh t<;l be \enlightened\ are in bed ... usually not alone. Obviously, this is nottheonly important qualificati0n for a successful and exciting college career, but it is important to most. So tell me, if females are so intrigued by males who understand that woman are intelligent, why is it that the men who are telling the woman how much they can bench press are surrounded by females, while the guy- who is speaking to women about the advantages/disadvan~ges about relationships (for example) usually ends up talking to himself? Another item in the: article which caught my eye is similar to sometlling I .mentioned earlier. The question Amy proposes; where are the women's unions at Union?, is a valid question .. Instead of complaining about it in an article, go out and do something about it! It seems to me that you believe most women share your C()ncerns, so there should be no problem in attaining members. about from my point of view. I believe that there are many people around campus, who, whether they like it or not, would agree with what I have to say. I cannot stress enough how much I wish everything worked the way that Amy wishes it would. However, this will never happen because as far as the women's movement has gone, I do not see a great change. To me, it is an extremely \attractive trait\ for a woman to speak intelligently. In addition, like many other males, I do not fear strong, intelligent, independent women, as long as they have some moderation! There is a limit to how strong and independent a person should be, whether male or female. As long as someone is not offending another person, I have no complaints. So please women, if you are sick of the men who do not respect you, if you are strong, intelligent, and independent, I suggest you select a new clientele to associate with who do respect you, because, believe me, the bar is not as exciting as it sounds at 4:00 am on a Saturday! Michael Fiol problem that academics 'is not a _...;.__....._ _______________ ~-----1: \enlightened menw you are Let me reiterate tllat I am simply trying to be hofiest and assess the ~ituation I read The Controversial Snuggler To the Editor: As a journalist for a newspaper, you must be aware of the power of words. 9ne word can and has sparked many different reactions. The word I refer to is \snuggle-~~~ I'm sure you are aware br oow that thew use of this: word has raised controversy. Personally, when I snuggle it is with someone I know a11d like. The, snuggler you refer to pervertedly fondled. lllld,groped women- inexcusllbly and without :permission, tenifying them. That, to many, is not snuggling. Unfortunately, your article caused many to think tllat you trivialized the ililcident. I understand what r.our article · tried to accomplish. However. when dealing with such important issues in the future, please realize that you must be tactful and COllSiderilte. I request that you remember that you are a jcurnalist, and every word counts when writing an article. Also, do not feel that you must defend • yourself as a journalist every time someone gives you criticism, in which I refer to the letter to the editor you wrote which is in the October 15th issue. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me. Thank ycu.

Better Than Last Erin M. O'Neil Features Writer I had an interesting evening tonight. I watched \Basic Instinct\ with about eight guys. and one other girl. A once in a lifetime experience I thought. Why not take notes and write an article about it? WeU. it didn't take me Iong to figure out that I would have nothing fit to print in those notes. A few choice excerpts from the conversation (subtle, and printable comments): blood flow factor, major chub, buff, need I say more? While this event was both entertaining and educational, I realized I could never describe it in the Concordi the way I could in say ... Hustler, so there I was, left witll an empty feeling. Nothing to write about- again! And I had so wan ted to redeem myself after last week's poor showing. Then at that very moment, like an angel of salvation, in walked Ian Prout with a copy of \'The Weekly World News.\ I'm not proud to say that I haven't really been keeping abreast of the presidential campaign, and I missed the debate. so I guess it was the headline \Alien Tells Clinton and Bush: Five U.S. Senators are Space Aliens!\ that caught my eye. I feel so stupid, so uninformed! How could this. an obviously major campaign issue, have slipped my attention? God, I had better read up before I fill out my absentee ballot. It seems this alien invited Bush and Clinton to a summit in Washington D.C., at which time he revealed that five senators also share his alien background. Can you believe this? The alien then went on to name these five senators, the most prominent being former astronaut John Glenn, now senator .of Damon Keller's home state of Ohio (Gosh, does that mean everyone from Ohio is an alien?). Apparently this alien's goal is to secure himself a cabinet position in either administration, as he backs both candidates. I myself feel that this is really great, and now I just can't decide who to vote for, seeing as both candidates are so accepting of space aliens, an issue of extreme importance to me. Oll, and just in case you suspected your neighbors were also space aliens, the \News\ provides a checklist you might want to use to confirm those suspicions. Thank God! I must read on. It's been so long since I've read a newspaJJer. there must be so much more to catch up on. - There is! Girls, if all the hype about leaking breast implants wasn't enough to make you get them removed, maybe one woman•s moving story will change your mind. Poor Anita Rose Evert's life has been shattered \because two years after they were put in, her breasts began glowing like headlights ·and they're still glowin~ even though the implants have been removed!\ There's even a picture. so it must be true. I think Anita should look on the positive side of this situation. She'll never lleed a flashlight to go down to tile basement to look for something. She can go jogging at night without the fear ()f being struck by oncoming cars. What fun she could llave at parties! Anita should stop bitching, and make light of the situation. I think most guys would be mystified by a woman with light-up breasts. Am I wrong? This next story really hit close to home for me. I can't tell you how many times I've gone into the SkeiJar and asked for a double-decker turkey sandwkh, extra thick. Well those days are over after reading the tragic story, \Man's Eyeballs Pop Out When He Eats a Double-decker Sandwich! \ I never knew that could llappen! I should be more careful. If you could only see the picture of this deeply saddened young man, Steve Pearcy, former welder, sitting in his rocker with patches over both eye sockets, leaning on his cane. Why it would just break your heart, as mine is breaking now. Imagine what he must have felt wllen one eyeball fell on his lap~ while the other landed on the kitchen table. Picture his devastation when the Week doctors told :!lim llis VISion could never be restored. But amazingly. Steve h.as managed to maintain a positive attitude about the situation. saying \At least now I can eat aU the double-deckers I please.\ What a brave young man, worthy of admiration. The tragecly continues. Heartless granny Gertrude Cox showed up for a driving test with a three year old boy wedged into the grill of her car! I think the police officer wh() arrested her put it best when he said, \I don't have anything against old S!olks but this woman should not be behind the wheel. When you drive around with a lcid stuck in the grill of your car. something is seriously wrong.\ Very perceptive on his part, I think. While there were no pictures accompanying this article, I can just imagine how gory the scene must have been. Fortunately, the little tyke sUIVived, suffer;ing from broken ribs, a spinal fracture, and a concussion. Sadly, Gertrude felt no remorse. Finally, I w()uld like to share some of the more interesting predictions with you, made by world renowned psychic, Peter Meers. · Mike Tyson finds true love with prison inmate \Big Bubba.\ - Dolly Parton's left breast explodes during a nationally televised special. - Michael Jackson's face melts off after an energetic perfonnance. - Oprab Wimfrey loses eighty seven pounds when her legs are severed in a car accident. What tragedy is in store for us! Mr. Meers also has a nine hundred number, if you'd like to talk with him personally about your own future. I personally am too frightened to do so. Gee, I'm so glad I got a hold of this newspaper_ I feel so well informed, so ... worldly. I advise ail of ~ou to pick up a copy of \Weekly World News\.

I usually debate for a while whether I should really abandon the wann covers for the trudge to the college center by 9:45 to meet the rest of the crew. But the memories of the previous week, the feeling of accomplishment wins over and I'm up and ready for a morning of dirty, noisy manual labor. We Care About U- Schenectady consists of about 20 to 30 students. The executive board, working along side a crew of volunteer members spend their Saturday mornings renovating houses in the Hamilton Hill area in Schenectady. The club was founded 2 years ago, connecting Union to the outside community through a common goal. We work with Better Homes Inc., providing them with volunteer labor so that low income families can afford to buy 'houses. The depressing state of our country's economy and living conditions is all around us, especially in the area we work in. Ironicany the crew has loads of fun working through this problem. The fact that we are making a slight, but tangible dellt in the housing problem allows us to justify the fun we are having. Gathering at the present site, on Paige street, we all look lost, confused and sleepy. Yet soon our friend and 'boss' Fred, part of Better Homes Inc., shoos us to all parts of the house, with work for everyone. We all transform into a makeshift construction crew and flee with hammers, nails, and measuring tape. An hour later, the site has an atmosphere of ordered chaos. Some are replacing old, shattered windows, or insulating a C()rner, while others learn the art of sheet- rocking, and the delicate skill Tired of dorm lau.ndry rooms? of cutting out an electrical socket box. These are the same students seen studying in the library, attending sports games and eating at Dutch, not your average, everyday hard hats. But everyone at We Care About U seems to have a desire to soak up all they can about the work done each week, and the hands on experience makes for quick learning. The enthusiasm ~is definitely what makes the time run by so fast, and before we all realize it, the president Shea W allon calls out for a lunch break. Its during lunch and the other short breaks, the reality of where we are and what we are actually doing kicks in. The work itself becomes a game, a great activity for us to get to unwind from academic life. Not until we put down our tools do we really hear the shouts from across the street and remember the house we're renovating will become £ lh @Irli ~cmJID. C !Q)JlJID.

The neighborhood is as alive as we are during ,these mornings. We have witnessed a few fights already between residents, one involving the police. They all e11d up being nothing more that loud, cursing argumellts, and are probably very common occurrences on Hamilton Hill. But the residents scream at each other with enough anger and vehemency for us to see the world we have all plainly been sheltered from. Upstairs in the attic, a group. just exploring around, came across a box of bullets. At the time, the discovery became the focus for great jokes and far-fetched stories, but the ,truth of the situation is scary. Who knows how old the owner of the bullets could have been. We acted like little kids upon the discovery of a hidden treasure, but in reality, we could be the adults who have f~mnd the secret loot of a twelve year old. In another incident, during the first year We Care About U .s.tarted, the founder himself, Jeff Gower spotted dynamite in ,the house being renovated. To ensure safety, the police roped ()ff the entire area, while the @.omb squad handled the explosives!

<;::QNCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 22, 1992 • PAGE 16 AN AIDS REFRESHER COURSE New t~cbnoi~'Y sheds light A long·bummg. &lectromc hght bulb; known as the E·lamp, is the first of by Eileen Colkin Science and Health Editor This week, as most of us probably know, is the sixth annual Aids Awareness Week. Although many of us think we know just about everything we need to when it comes to AIDS, its not a bad idea to refresh our memories every once in a while just in case there's some important information we've missed or forgotten. So- even if you DO know everything about AIDS- it wouldn't be a bad idea to read this article to brush up on your facts, because when it comes to a disease that kills, you can never be too educated. The disease AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is passed by the semen, vaginal discharges, or blood of HIV -infected people. Once it infects someone, HIV destroys the cells that defend the body. Without the cells that make up its immune system, the body cannot defend itself from illnesses. Disease and infections then move in without a fight. HIV also becomes part of the body's cells. The virus can hide in these cells and act like a time bomb. It may take a long time (many years) before AIDS develops. When people have AIDS, their bodies' defenses (immune system) have been severely damaged by the AIDS virus (HIV). When that happens, they can get different kinds ol infections and cancers. It is these illnesses that can kill. When signs of AIDS de appear, they vary from .person to person. Some people get fevers or diarrhea. Most swollen that won't go away. Many lose weight for no apparent reason. However, only a doctor ot specific blood tests can tell if these signs are related to HIV. One of the most frightening aspects of this disease is that people infected with HIV usually look and feel healthy, since it may take several years before symptoms are visible. People may not even know they are infected. Today, about 1 to 1.5 million people in the United States have HIV and can unknowingly be spreading it to others. Most people with HIV or AIDS get the virus by having sex or sharing drug needles with someone who already has HIV. Anyone who bas the virus can pass it on to others. Women can infect men as well as other women. Infected women can even infect their babies before and·during birth and by breast feeding. More than a third of babies born to infected mothers will have the virus and develop AIDS. The numbers of women and babies with HIV are growing. On college campuses especially, due to the widespread non- monogamous sexual relationships, AIDS is a continuous and growing threat to both men and women. Fortunately. you cannot .. catch\ mv like you do a cold or flu. Unlike many other viruses. HIV does not spread by traveling through the air. Even though mv is sometimes found in saliva, it is not quickly spread through spit. HIV is very fragile and dies quickly outside the body, therefore you cannpt pick up the virus from toilet seats or· mosquitoes. The safest way to protect yourself from the virus is to not have sex. or at least to wait · a new .generation of lighting technology.

The best way to protect yourself fr(i)m this deadly disease is tllrough education, so always make .sure you know the facts. If you have questions or doubts, all the National AIDS Information Hotline at 1-800-342-AlDS, and if there's even the remotest possibility that you've been in contact with the mv virus get tested immediately. There are some treatments that can help prevent diseases that attack AIDS victims and can help you live longer. So do yotUself a favor- stop wondering and .know for sure. If you don't THINK you have AIDS, imag~ne how relieving it would be to know for a fact tllat you are not infected.

CONCORDIENSIS e OCTOBER 22, 1992 • PAGE 17 THE HORMONE QUESTION by Bruno Benzaquen Contributing Writer To \have the right chemistry\ is an expression use to describe couples who get along and complement t(aCh other particularly well. Most people will be surprised to know that emotions and relationships might be governed by complex biochemical processes in the body .. Surely, falling in love, the most noble of all feelings, is not regulated by molecu~ar processes. must be more poetic -more esoteric -more mysterious! WeU ... rnaybe not. In 1973 the compound phenylethylamine (PEA) was discovered and attributed the function of a neurotransmitter and has scince intrigued many researchers. This compound has been found to influence alertness, excitement and· mood.· ·much like ampMtamines which bear a highly structural resemblance to PEA. \Being in love,\ therefore, might be explained by a high concentration of PEA in the brain. It is hypothesized that the levels of PEA are modulated by the pituitary gland. This seems very likely since the removal of this gland (because of a tumor) has been proven to somehow prevent an individual from forming strong emotional bonds. Sex, on the other hand, although closely linked to the fact of being in ·love (for some ... ) is governed by a whole different set of chemical processes. In both males and females the sex drive is determined {)y the concentrations of androgens rJO.-\\'-\\'\''\' v·ua\-\ 21 testos.terone. Although only 6% of the level of testosterone in males are found in females, this h<Ormone still directs the sexual drive of women. It has been found that relatively high levels of androgens are found in women who enjoy and participate in sexual activities more often than 1hose who don't. One's libido is also controlled by the pituitary gland, found in the base of the brain. Removal of this gland very much impaks sexual dr'i:ve, although it can be restored by the injection of androgens on a regular basis. Converse~y, the libido can be decreased by reducing the serum concentration of testosterone. This can be accomplished with the help of drugs such as Depo-Provera (methoxyprogesterone acetate) helpfml in the treatment (chemical castration) of recurrent sexual offenders, which~ in Great Britain, has already been used. In reality, desires, emotions and sensations are governed by many other chemical processes and compounds that we still do not understand well. Nex.t on this list comes the much controversial existence of human pheromones. It is common knowledge that many animal species release chemical compa.unds termed pheromone to- induce mating. For example, female dogs, when they are in heat, release a compoung in their urine that attracts male dogs ( from all over the neighborhood- believe me!) • A stumbling drunk female at a party represents also a cue for some males to approach her,. scientifically proven that there is a presence of pher()mones. It has been suggested recently that compounds found in the sweat and urine of humans, . and androstenol, may just fit the bill of human pheromones. · In some controlled studies, women wearing masks which were impregnated with these compounds found :people more attractive and desirable than those who were not wearing them. But don't go buying similar androstenol based perfumes- they a11e a commercial scam. The amount present in those sol11tions are insignificant. To continue this discussion, unfortunately other myths must be shattered. Although :>ur culture is filled with popular anecdotes about aphrodisiacs, tllere is absolutely no scientific evidence that any such substance actually exists. Ginseng does contain some honnone-like substances but it has no effect on the sex drive. Oysters, from all that I have read has no effect either. Casanova, the great Spanish romantic, used \Spanish fly\. This is a dried mixture made of green blister beetles from Spain. The active ingredient in the mixture is can1haridin, a compound that irritates the urogenital tract thereby producing false erections, in larger doses it is poisonous. What have I learned from all of this? That scien-ce is wonderful in break:iag a \'-''\~, heart!.! Information courtesy of \Chemistry and the Modern World\; J.A. Shwcrrtz.

'· CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 22, 1'992 • PAGE 21 CYCLING TRADITION CONTINUES WITH MUCKSTER MASH by -Greg Tomac Contributing Writer It may surprise ma11y to know that there is a rich tradition af cycling at Union. .Before the Tour Dupont there · was the Tour de Union .and its winneJ:s ate showcased on a trophy ·exhibited at the C()llege Center's trophy case. The last Tour de Union took place in 1989 and was won by Ken Perel. Now the Cycling Club ha.s introd11ced a dirt version of this race and called it •... the Muckster Mash? Professor Karl De Jesus~ faculty advisor of the Cycling Club explained. \ We (the Cycling Club) wanted to put on a race that would allow as many people as possible to participate. Not too ma11y people own road bikes but there must be over a hundred mountain bikes on campus. So, we thought a mountain bike race would be the best way to get people out there.\ When pressed about the race name De Jesus added, \ That's Jamey Rawstron's creation. Our mountain bikers have a fascination with mull and they wanted to show that in the race name. But, really, the race is mostly run on paved roads or gravel so there won't be that much mud around. I just hope people will come, race and have .a good time!' ActuaHy~ the race,course did not look that bad, ~even to a novice like myself. It is basically flat with riders doing, depending on category, between three to five laps around a loop a little over a mile long. there is a dirt section behind the Jackson Gardens and a gravel loop around the Richmond House visitors parking lot. According to Cycling Club members it is a fun race open to all students, faculty and staff. Prospective riders will be glad to irnow that members of the cycling team win not be allowed to ride so they stand as good a chance as anyone of winning one of the trophies or prizes. By tile way. there is a special trophy for the best three people team. The club is hoping that dorms, fraternities and sororities will get together and slug it out on the course to decide who is the best on Gampus, The race will ·take place during Parent's Weekend on Sunday, November 1 at 11:30 am in front of the College Center with ~;e gistration stm_:ting at t0:30. There will also be two exhibition events put on by the club starting at 10:30 am - a trackstand competition and a trials competition. If this eve11t is successful the club plans to sponsor a large tour around Schenectady county this spring. \We hope to increase participation and excitement about cycling in this campus. Who knows, maybe some of these riders will go on to join our cycliQg team,\ De Jesus added with a hopeful note. ~ ountaln ill lite mace SWlday, Nov. 1 11:30 am Open to all students. faculty and staff - Cycling Team members no:t eligible.

By Hal Poret Co-Sports Editor What is it that really gives teams a \home-field advantage\ in professional sports? Does the undying love of a Utah Jazz fan actually guide a ball shot by John Stockton into the basket at home in the Salt Palace? And can the cheers of 40,000 grue- some looking men with brown and orange paint on their face and dog bones in their mouths really keep Pittsburgh Steeler running-backs out of the end'\ zone in Cleveland, year after year? Well, not exactly, but this is closer to the truth than most other arguments. Though factors such as artificial turf vs. grass, or domed stadiums may provide an edge to a team at home, are these really an over-all advantage? Twins had made the series in an even year {which gives the National League team four home games), it may have been a\\~different story. In fact, Toronto just became the first dome team to win a world . series game away from home, though their dome is retractable and is only closed for part of the year. So it is evident that these special home-field advantages are not really advantageous at all. An Encouraging. End For Rugby Team By Chris Sears Staff Writer Another, muc-h deserved, season end has overtaken the men's Rugby team. The match this last weekend was held on a typical New England fall day with the wind blowing the chill into the bones of players and spectators alike. Despite the cold weather and the unfortunate A-side defeat, there was however reason to take heart. For those of you who saw the match, the vast improvement on the part of the rookie players was evident. This season's team, due to a lack of veterans, was obliged to place inexperienced players on the starting squad which is a frightening situation for both the new recruits and the seasoned players. Although this situation was initially detrimental to the success of the team, it has served to bolster the ranks of the U.R.F.C. for future seasons. Those players who only weeks ago strolled onto the pitch for t~eir first experience with :llle game of Rugby are now well versed with the game. The defeatt of the A- side team although disappointin:g, was overshadowed ·br the victory of the killer :B 's. The fraternal aspect of Rugby was evident just by looking at the overwhelming numbers of alumni who returned for their \'alumni game\. These -even more experienced pl(l)\'ers worked in well with the B~s to defeat the RPI B-side t.eam. and to give the Unio11 falls and players somethiqg to cheer about. The tetm B-side no longer holds the same meaning as it u:sed to now that both the A and B side teams contain rookie p1ayers. All of the newr members played the same .amount of time and learned rou~hly tbe same amount abo11t the game. Much ;as it may surprise the average spectator to leam, the 2ame of rugby involves countless complicated rules and the new players of this team barely had time to learn them let alone apply that · knowledge this season .. With this new kn.owledge in hand, this author expects great things out ()f the Rugby team in their up ... coming spring season. All are to be congratulated on what was on the whole a very successful season for the U.R.F.C. This winter the men's Rugby team will be doing some light conditioning work to both stay in shape and to stay in touch with the game. This would be an ideal opportunity for anyone interested in finding out whether Rugby is for them or not. Thanks to all om loyal fans who appeared faithfully, rain or shine. Keep your eyes open this spring as the Rugby team will be a force to contend with. First of all, the name of the game is winning, and no team that has particular trouble winning a game on grass, or winning on turf, never succeeds, even if they can win most of their games on their home field. In addition, it is argued that football teams which play in domes have an advantage, but look at their over-all success. No \dome team\ has ever even reached the Superbowl in the season in which they played their home games in the dome! In addition, since 1980, dome teams are an abysmal4-18 in the playoffs where it really counts. And this is not because they were inferior teams. The fact is that quality teams which become dependent on the comforts of their dome to win never win enough road games to gain the home-field· throughout the playoffs. And then they can usually be seen being blown out on a cold and windy day in some place like Unfortunately for us rational folks who want a concrete answer, the real home advantage comes from the fans. Look at the NBA. Basketball clearly provides the biggest home-court advantage over the other sports, and yet there is no physical evidence to explain it. Each baseball team has a uniquely shaped ball park, and either grass or turf, or even a dome. Football teams also have the grass/turf/dome factor, plus the problems of crowd noise for the road team. Hockey allows teams to set the amount of space behind the nets to favor their style of play, and in addition, the home team always gets to make the last line change which enables them· to choose which match- ' ups they want on the ice. t----------------------------------- Buffalo or Chicago. Only one dome team has ever won a playoff game on the road. Last year's Detroit Lions probably looked impressive going into the playoffs with a 12-4 record (8-0 at home), but you could bet the ranch that they would not win an outdoor, January game in Washington. Going into this year's World Series, the Minnesota Twins are the only dome team ever to reach, let alone win the World Series (1987,1991), and they did it without ever winning a road game. If the These are all concrete things which favor the home team, and none of these exist in basketball, yet we see a ridiculous home advantage in the NBA. The Utah Jazz win 90% of their home games while only winning half of their road games because of the emotional effects of the crowd on a teams perfonnance. Even teams near the bottom of the NBA manage to win nearly half of their home games while only winning 2 or 3 road games all season. The heart and enthusiasm of the fans seems to flow into players and t..'Iat is what gives them the winning edge. Look at the Philadelphia Eagles or Chicago Bears. They have no gimmicks to help them win. They just have great fans. Look at the Denver Broncos, whose fans can always spur Elway along to a last second win. So, I hope everyone will go out and support their favorite pro team, but more importantly let's increase attendance at Union home athletic .events and support our teams to victory. rite ports CROSS COUNTRY RUNN I Nli STRONG :By Tasba LaBare Contributing Writer They're off and running!

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 22, 1992 • PAGE 23 byHalPoret co-swrts Editor The World Series, which opened Saturday night in Atlanta, has alreday provided us with several interesting firsts. The Blue Jays are the first Canadien team to win a pennant and reach the World Series, and their manager Cito Gaston, is the first black manager to do the same. The Jays entered the league in 1977 and finished '54-l 07, forty-five and a hal£ games behind the Yankees. Toronto quickly improved and won their first AL East tide in ,1985, but fell to the KaDsas City Royals in the divisional playoffs. The Blue Jays again reached the playoffs in 1989 and 1991 only to lose to the Athletics and Twins, respectively. On the other side, the Braves have also never won a World Series .since the franchise moved to Atlanta. In 1958, .the Milwaukee Braves lost the series in 7 games to the Yankees, and the Braves had not returned until last year. The last time the Braves won the World Series, the year was 1957. Hank Aaron was the N.L. MVP and had 44 home-runs and 132 RBis while batting .322 for Milwaukee. The great Warren Spahn was the Cy Young award winner with a 21-11 record and a 2.69 ERA f<Jr the Braves. Mickey Mantle. the A.L. MVP, batted .365 to lead the Yankees to the World Series, under manager Casey Stengel. In the '57 series, Aaron hit .3 home-runs and batted .393. But the real Brave · hero (and consequently World Series MVP) was pitcher Lew Burdette, who pitched 3 complete game victories. 2 of them shutouts, while posting an ERA of0.67. The Braves are no longer in Milwaukee, and Spahn and Burdette are long since retired. However, the B'taves boast what is arguably the best starting pitching staff in John Smoltz, Steve A very and Tom Glavine, and a deep bullpen with· Mike Stanton, Pete Smith and Jeff Reardon. . Toronto counters with an equally awesome staff including Jack Morris, David Cone, Juan Guzman, Jimmy Key, and an equally effective bullpen in Duane Ward, Tom Henke, David Wells and Todd Stottlemyre. Talent runs very deep in both teams and both came in on emotional highs from their divisional playoff series; the Jays from making their first series, and the Braves riding the emotional wave from their unbelievable come- from-behind win against the Pirates in the bottom of the ninth' inning df game 7 ·of their series. UPDATE The Braves' biggest concern coming. .in was the . sub-par pitching performances of Tom Glavine and Steve A very against Pittsburgh. Glavine quickly silenced those fears by :Pitching a complete game 4-hitter as the Braves took game one 3-l. Joe Carter put Toronto ahead in the fourth with a solo-homer, but Atlanta scored 3 in the sixtb and held on behind a strong performance by Glavine. Toronto's starter Jack Morris pitched very well, but lost his bid to become the first ' .pitcher in baseball history to win a world series game with three teams. Morris pitches again in game 4. Smoltz, who won 2 .games against Pittsburgh and received the playoff MVP award, pitched 7 .strong innings in game 2. and tbe Braves appeared to be taking control of the · series. However, an unlikely hero. pinch-hitter Ed Sprague won the game in the ninth with a 2-run homer off of reliever Jeff Reardon, who had ironically won game 7 against the Pirates when the Braves made a miracle last inning come-back. So, the series went to Toronto for Tuesday~ Wednesday and tonight. Both teams will need strong pitching performauces to hold on to win. but if the first 2 games are any indication. it promises to be an exciting series. chach alk by john Schacfm1n~J..y Concordiensis Staff Here's a quick quiz for all the ignorant Canadians out Americans: What is the name there ...

Well I have news for all of NFL Saga Continues - Episode VII --------------------~------------------ By Rich Morgan Co-Sports Editor Well, as week seven of the NFL \soap opera\ comes to a close, there were no outlandish surprises that would make one's hair stand on end, alt:llough there were a few records broken. Hats off to Randall Cunningham, who broke the QB rushing record with 1,683 yds., surpassing Hall-of-Farner Fran Tarkent<Jn by 9 yds. (although it's a shame that his team forgot how to win - two consecutive losses have to Kansas City and Washington have dropped the Eagles to 4-2, one game behind the first-place Cowboys). Secondly, congrats to Jerry Rice for surpassing the centlli)i· mark for touchdowns scored (102 TD's) - he Dnly needs 24 more to reach the NFL record of 126, held by Jim Brown. As far as next week's games go, only two games on the card give just cause for goosebumps-the early game is WaShington (4-2) at Minnesota {5-1). Both teams are corning off big wins, but Washington may have the upper hand with a more potent defame. However, the Metrodome has been extremely kind to Minnesota so far, where they are a perfect 3-0 this season. They will definitely need the support of their fans, as well as some big plays to come out of this one victorious. The later game matches up Dallas (5·1) at the L.A. Raiders (3-4). The Raiders have looked impressive the past two weeks, including this week's shutout against the Seattle Seahawks. Dallas, who now maintains sole possession of first in the NFC East, looks to continue their \mopping up\ job of the AFC West (Dallas defeated both Kansas City and Seattle so far, with a combined score of 44-10). For the Raiders to be victorious~ they must pick apart the unpredictable Cowboy se<:ondary, since Dallas has one of the best rushing defenses in the league. Home-field advantage is key for L.A., and they must strike early if they are going to win, for Dallas has not been much of a second-half team this season. Now, for the moment you've all been waiting for .. . here are the NFL top 5 after seven weeks of play: Team Record Pts l.San Francisco 2.Miami 3.Dallas 4.Buffalo 5.Denver Now, before you start screaming, \B ___ S ___ !\ let me explain why San Francisco is ahead of Miami. # 1: the s<Jhedule. The only wotthy opponent for Miami thus far has been Buffalo, a team who just has not been themselves lately. As far as the seasom goes, they play six games against the \Three Stooges\ of the AFC East: the Colts, Jets, and \powerhouse\ New England (whof by the way, have a comb,ined record of 4-14 thus .far}. #2: the San Francisco offense. QB Steve Young is the NFL's number one rated passer in the game today·. He lights up the scoreboard like Rockefeller Center on Christmas Eve. Oh, and' then there's Jetry Rice (see above). Enough said. By the way, 41 years after the bombing of Pearl HarbOr, 011 December 6th, there will be another bombing. Miami goes to San Francisco for a {dare I say) ... possible Super Bowl preview (?} Ifs still several 6-1 6-0 5-1 4-2 5-2 216 168 139 166 100 118 94 99 102 130 weeks away, but it's fun to anticipate. Dallas is third and rightly so. Their offense weapons go without mention, as well as their ability to execute the big plays. Their defense has allowed only a single touchdown in eight quarters of play, while their rushing defense is among the top three in the league. They rank just ahead of Buffalo, who has been, surprisingly enough. struggling as of late. Not to worry, Bills fans; they will still be in the thick of the playoff hunt come December. Why, you may ask, is Denver in the top 5? Well, after his third 4th quarter comeback this season (22 in his career), \Elway magic\ is as strong as it ever was. Although they struggle to put points on the board, they seem to always score w~en it's absolutely necessary. Some may say, \What about Philadelphia?\ Well, they still are a potent defe.nsive team, but they have failed two consecutive weeks in a row to win on the road, which is a must in being a winning team in the NFL. Next week. they play Phoenix at home, and a win would return them to the statns they held when they bombed the Cowboys two weeks ago. Who knows? Maybe Tampa Bay will make the Top 5 next week ...

Water Polo's Success Continues by Lee Schachter Staff Writer The Union water pol() team kept up their winni11g ways this. past weekend as they traveled to RPI to complete the two-weekend Mid- Atlantic C<>nference League Tournament. Going into the weekend, Union had a 3-1 record, tied with Col!Jate for second place out of eight teams. This past weehnd, Union won twice an<! tied once to bring their tournament record to 5-l-1. This kept Union tied for second, l>ut with C<Jrnell now instead of C()lgate. Colgate d.Iopped to fo11rth while Hartwick retained its first place standing. Union's first test this weekend was Buffalo State. Getting off to a quick start, the team sped to a very early 4-0 lead. They never looked back, as they finislled the game with a 15-4 victory. The starters, Sven Zabka, Dave Robison, Geoff Wolfe, Scott Bowden. Cluis Yousey, and Dave L uniansky. set the tone early with strong play on both offense and defense, and then the bench got into tbe water and joined in the scoring. The game against L{lbman the next day turned ()Ut to have the same st()tyline. The final score ·Df,. the Lehma11 game was 16-0. Between the two games, 14 differe11t players scored. They w-ere: Wolfe, Bowden, Zabla, Luniansky, Cliff Shaw, Chris Riley, Seth Sealfo11, Dave Saad, Adam Horst~ Jenn Tenell, Martin Logan, Lee Schachter, Erica Saltz, and Dmitri Konan. Th-e most exciting game of Ule weekend was against Cornell. Everyone knew it would be a to11gb game down to tbe end. Union got off to a r{)u gh start, trailing Cornell after the fust quarter by a score of 3-0. Coach Mark Walsh's instructions at the end of the q11arter were to . \conce11trate on our defense. That'£ ()Uf bread and butter.\ So wi111 the rally cry of \DEFENSE!\ for the second straigllt week, the team began to pick up momentum and C()nfidence as the second qmuter wore on. Union shut Cornell out that quarter and took a 4-3 lead at the half. due to great defense and great goaltending by Dmitri Konan, who stopped several of Cornell's fast break opp()rtunities. Luniansky had tllree of the goals and Rob is on had one. The next half started out a little shaky for the Dutchmen as Cornell scored three straight and took a 6-4 lead into the fourth quarter. So Union again rose to meet the cllallenge, and created many turnovers on defense amd converted them into opportunities to score on offense. With Luniansky scoring two more goals, the score was tied at 6 with a little over a minute left. Then, on a pass from Yousey, Bowden was fouled from behind while trying to shoot, resulting in a four- meter penalty shot which Yousey took and promptly launched into the upper left corner to give Union a 7-6 lead with about a minute left. Konan and the defense held offComell's offense and got the ball back, but with twenty seconds left Cornell got another chance. With eleven seconds left, Cornell was fouled and was entitled to a free .pass, but made the nristake of shooting the ball instead. The referee then made the mistake of allowing the goal to count, and the score was then tied at seven when the game ended. Since Union ended the tournament in the top four, the team qualified to go to the Mid-Atlantic Conference Championships at Kutstown State, right outside of Pbiladelphia. the weekend of October 31st. So if you want to go on a road trip, this is the one you want to go on. Remember, water polo is exciting and fun to watch, so come on out and support the team! Homecoming loss for Football Tean1 by Dagan La Corte Associate Sports Editor Satutday October 17, marked Union's Homecoming. Unfortunately, the Datchmen were unable to win for the home crowd, as they dropped their third s!J\aight game with a 23-8 loss to the Engineers of RPI.

The game startetl off poorly for the Dutchrn~n. as the initial kickoff w:a:s run back 83-yards by the Engineers for a touchdown. The Dutchmen were 11nable to convert on their first possession. On RPI's next rnn., they took the lead 14-0 on a 32-yard touchdown pass by qtJarterback Grabowski. Unio11 again was unable to sc()re on the ensuing possession. When RPI got the ball back they marched dow11 the field and picked up a 21-yard field goal, and a 17-<l lead. RPI continued to dornirute the game, and befo~e the first half was over~ they had taken a 23-0 lead.

Students in the Senior and Junior classes have not been completing their GenEd science requirements. science classes the reprecussions will run in a vicious cycle. The present problem will prevent underclassmen from completing their reqtJirements in a timely fashion,. creating another science course backup. It would be easy to blame the GenEd program for the crisis, but enrollment for the past two terms point .to another culprit, the student booy. For the last two terms, tile GenEd science courses have been under-enrolled. Last year, the classes were only 85% filled and this term they were still not filled to their potelltial. would print 'Finish Science Requirements' pn their meal cards,\ Sorum said, half jokingly. To he-lp remedy the situation, underclassmen are encour-aged to finish their GenEd requirements by their sophomore year and upperclassmen are encouraged to do so as soon as possible. \I'm sacred,\ Sorum worries, \I'm afraid that some seniors wo.1't take this seriously and won't finish in time for graduation.\ GenEd is a real requirement and all are encouraged to fulfill their credits as soon $ possible. October 29, 1992 William H. Gray Ill, President and C.E. 0 of the United Negr() College Fund, and former House Majority Whip, to speak Nov. 4 See Page 2. In the class of 1993. there are still 53 students who need to take one science course to fulfill their requirements and 10 students who have not taken any sciences as of the present .. Among the class of 1994, there are 121 students who :need to take one science in the next year and a half, and another 45 juniorS' who need two science courses. The GenEd board has a dilemma in trying to remedy the situation. But why the panic? This only affects half of the college. The Sophomore and Freshman classes have nothing to worry about, right? Wrong! All classes are affected by this problem. The number of Seniors and Juniors who need to take GenEd science courses total to 211. The solution would seem easy, just add a couple extra sections and hire new professors. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. New sections mean that teachers who have filled teaching schedules already would have to take on more classes. Not all of them want to do this and tile school does not have the projler funds to pay the profess()rs tllat would be willing to teach the extra courses. Finding a new professor of the quality tllat Union expects is not easy to accomplish either. ADMIS.SIONS 1992: UP, BUT HAS UNION LOWERED ITS STANDARDS? Unfortunately there are only about 111 spaces in GenEd science courses available for winter term. This puts a terrific amount of pressure on the science department. Because the registration system allows Seniors and Juniors to register first they will shut out many underclassmen. On account of this the over- flow of students needing Stud.

Maybe we Say No to Bill p.7 NHL Update p. 23 by Alisa Gass Ccmcordiensis Staff Union College and other small private colleges like Union are accepting a higher percentage of tlleir applicants now as compared to four years ago. This fact alone may mean that Union's Admissions Office is not being as \selective\ or \competitive\ as it used to be. But does the percentage of accepted applicants reflect the academic standards of the instituti<m? These two factors can be related, but there are many other things that have to be considered. First, it is essential to look at some statistics to create the big pict11re. As far as the 1989-1990 Union College applicants, the senior class now, 3,437 applied, 1356 (39%) were accepted, and 529 of these 1356 enrolled. Seventy :percent were in the top 1/5 of their gmduating high school class, and 92% were in the top 2/5. Fifty-.two percent of the 1990-1991 applicants were accepted, yet only 443 students enrolled. The 1991~1992 applicants were accepted at a rate of 64%, 500 of the 1847 enrolled. Of the 1992-1993 applicants. the 57% accepted make up this year•s freshman class. According to Dean Lun~tuist of the Admissions Office, 11le ratio of stude11ts that apJ>\'lr to students that are accepte<l i_s a measure of how difficlllt it is to be an admit to the scl!ool This percentage is not a clir-ect reflection of academic standards. F()r exam1Jle_ a popular state un.i:versity, lJVM, is a very difficult school for students out-()f-state to ,get in, but the average academic standing of tlteir student llod.y is lower than that of Union College. Union's acceptance rate increased after the class ()f 1()94 had only 443 students elltoll; usually classes have at le2st 510 students in them. The typical rate ()f accepta11ce at colleges like Union: Hamiltoll, Lafayette, a11d Bucknell is 50%-75%. Colgate admitted over 50% in tile last two yea:rs. Dean Lundquist pointe<l on t one of Union's proble:tns; according to th<! college guides, Union is one of New York's \best kept secrets\. Uni()n shouldn't be a secret. BecatJse of some of the difficulty Admission-s had with recruitment, per<:ent acceiJtoed had to increase. However, tltere are cll.anges being made. This year recruitment has gone mp. Union's Admissions Office., The Ambassador Progr~rn ~ along with alumni, and lri()W · faculty have taken an active position in recruiting prospective students by making phone calls and writi11g letters. Last year, 9.500 hi~h school students requested infonnation about Union: this year. as of October 22, 17,978 requested information. Kris Gernert- Dott. Assistant Dean of Admissions, claims that 11ow there are more positive responses from prospective students. Because U nioll is generating more interest, tllere will be more applicants, a11d therefore, a more competitive slant will be re-introd11ced. Union's Admissio11s Office may have a reason t() worry.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 29, 1992 • PAGE 2 RESIDENCE LIFE HAS NO GUARANTEE Student Forum Spotlight by Duffy ·Rubenstein Concordiensis Staff Many rumors have been circulating arotmd the Union campus about the lack of beds for students returning from tenns abroad. Although there is some question as to where all of these students will be housed, some·of the rumors are untrue. There are 14 7 .students who are abroad this term. There will be onty forty-seven students going abroad winter term. There will be 100 additional students on campus winter term, and the administration has been faced with the task of finding housing for them. Trish Williams, the Director of Residence Life, has been working on as solution to the problem. Dean Williams has an optimistic outlook toward the dilemma of finding housing for the returning students: \I think that they will all be housed if they want·housing.\ Dean Williams added that the students might not get their first residence choices. Many Union students are not fully aware of the housing policies. The Union College Student Handbook .states, \All Union Students must live on campus providing there is housing available.\ The housing policy dictated by the Board of Trustees and the Administration says that all Union students must live on campus through their junior year. This regulation has not been stringently enforced in the past because there has not been a need to force students to live on campus. The need for stricter guidelines has emerged for two reasons. First, the Class of 1994 is a relatively small class. In the fall of 1990, there were fewer students then needed to who been placed on 'dean's vacation', and early graduates are confirmed. Once these numbers have been tabulated, the Office of Residence Life will be able to deal with the housing problems for students who are abroad. The students will be housed in Greek housing, residence halls, or they will be permitted · to move off-campus if they have been released to do so, according to Williams. a Greek House}.

COMEDIENNE LANDOLPHI EDUCATES WHlLE ENTERTAINING PORTILLA TO SPEAK ~oF QUINCENTENARY by Veronica Rogers Associate News Editor Suzi Landolpbi, educator, comedienne, and role-model, pulled together all different types of students last Friday night during her \Hot Sexy, and Safer\ perfonnance. Landolphi gave the large audience insight into many of the issues surrounding the subject of sex and risky behavior. Her message was an infonnative lesson on many of society's stigmas that people have to overcome in order for society to actually become safer. Landolphi stressed that she wasn't there to lecture the audience but rather to break some of the barriers that keep people from communicating, barriers can lead - to the possibility of contracting diseases. Landolphi used audience participation in order to show the audience how easy it was to be comfortable with one other. Although she wasn~t trying to embarrass the students she pulled up, it was her way to show how society has brought up this generation, to be embarrassed about sexual acts, or discussion of sexual matters. Landolphi brought up the subject of AIDS and the fact that so many people college age and younger think that because they are not in the specific four groups known to be high risk that they are not at risk. Just because they are not IV drug users or Homosexuals, or bi-sexuals, or someone in the need of a transfusion they think they are invulnerable. People have to realize tlley are always at risk whenever they get sexually involved with another person. This is why people need to know the facts. Landolplli brought up the need to talk about sexuality. 'fhe level of personal emibarrassment is very high, especially for girls. Sh.e states how kids are brought up to either admire or ignore their \prjvate parts\. Men are told tllal th.eir \privates•• are such gifts and tlley should always think: of them this way. Girls are brought up to be emfuarrassed about their sexual .parts. . There needs to be a cllamge in the perception of one's physiology. Girls need to feel comfortable with what they have, if not as much as guys are, then at least to gain a better feeling about what they are made of. The problems with embarrassment of one's body are that communication can be absent during a sexual encvunter. Botll people might be uncomfortable with their lxx:lies so they don't talk about what they are doing, or of the consequences of their actions. Landolphi said that _people have to feel comfortable with themselves before they can feel comfortable with someone else. To turn off the ligltts, and to kiss continuously just to avoid verbal confrontations are clt~ar signs that one or both of the people are uncomfortable with their sexual activity. In a college atmospllere it · can be even more noticeable that people feel uncomfortable with sex. ual activity. C()n:sidering that college dating often revolves around parties, drunken hook-ups between people who sometimes don't know each others names are common. This leads to embarrassment during the encounter and the next day when the gossip spreads. With so many people feeling uncomfortable with wllat they are doing with their bodies, it is easy to understand w by there is so much misunderstanding about sexual activity and the real risks it entails. The insecurities that women feel because of the way society has conditioned them, and the insecurities that sexually inexperienced people have are what need to be erased. Landolphi stressed the need for a change in everyone's attitudes about sexual behavior. As the speaker was being open and honest with the audience, she asked the same of all the people. Landolphi said that communication, honesty and trust, were the only things that would keep a person truly safe. If two people understand each other's needs and wants, inhibitions and fears, that is the first step to making a strong and healthy relationship. Landolphi's humor was an ice breaker for the audience, her message was a lifetime lesson. DONT FORGET TO V01EFOR CONGRESS NOVEMBER3.

This came after months of well organized, legally run Congressional investigations into the President's influence peddling, diversion of millions of dollars in public funds, and the creation of \fantasmasH (shadow bank accounts) for continued embezzlement of public monies. The President's wife (Rosanne Collot) has recently been indicted for diverting (to her family) millions of dollars ear-marked for the poor. (Almost half of all Brazilians live in absolute misery--with insufficient food and shelter to even maintain health). The national \impeachment ja\ •demonstrations co11tinued, led by hundreds of thousands of B:razilian teenagers and college and university students--dubbed the \caras pintadas\ for the green, yellow. and black paint on their faces. Some of Uni10n's students participated in the impressively organized, participant, non-violent impeachment demonstrations. Uniaon students lived the historic moment when the H()use of Deputies voted 441 to 38 to impeach President Collor. Brazilians are to be congratulated for w<lrking · within .their framework of their newly established formal democracy. Additional turmoil unfolded in the October 3 massacre of 111 inmates at Sao Paulo's Carandiru House of Detention by police officers. The trouble began during a fight between inmates in Cell Block 9 - an overloaded, rat an<t coclroach infested confinement wing buill for less than one thousand in-mates, housing, at tlte time of the massacre, over two thousand men. On that day, special SWAT units of Sao Paulo's military and civil police stormed cell block 9, ostensibly to quell fights between prisoners.

STUDENT FORUM 1996 Bethan Evans Communication between tile students · and the a<lministration is the most effective step towards change. As representative for the senior class of 1993, it is my job to relate the interests and concerns of our class to the Student Fe~rum and the administration, as well as assist in planning se11ior related activities. My ex.tensive involvement in campus organizations has enabled me to reach out to a wide variety of students, which is the main objective of each ~presentative. Being elected as a member of the Student F()rum would allow me to s~rve our college community a.s an interested and informed s1Uldent who wants to help our class make a difference this ye;ar and for the other years to fdlow. Let us make our final year at Union our best! Ned Walley Social life on campus has 11ndergone a dramatic change si11ce the fall of 1989. This came as quite a shock to many people. Better communication between the student body and the administration might have softened this blow. Nonetheless, it was an i1•evitable step, as Union was fast becoming a dinosaur regarding its lax social JlOlicies. A position in the Student Forurn is bestowed upon a Jlerson whose peers feel will llecome a competent and teliable source of dialogue and ~eneral communication with tile College's administrative llodies. I submit myself as a candidate to the Student Forum for the class of 1993. 1993 Seth Brown On Friday you are going to make a very important decision. You are going to elect someone to represent your views and ideas. I am suppose to tell you a little bit about myself so you can decide who to vote for. How can I distinguish myself out from other candidates? Actually I can't do that in a statement, you would have to moot me in library shelves are far from stacked and it closes at 11:30. 'JJhe aU night study room is far from quiet and by taking lounges away at West leaves us less options for quiet study. Now ~the cafeteria is open. until midnight to study; but what if we would like to study later? Must we study in the hall if we have a tired roommate? It comes down to this: The eollege should let us decide what is best for us. After all they decide for themselves. More than haif of college is :leam.ing how to be independent and by making vital decisions for us destroys this part of our education. I feel that I am best suited to voice ow opinion on these and other important issues. I am always open to new ideas and I am never afraid to express them, even when I don't have much of a chance. If you agree with me. and want Union College to be youi\ school rather than theirs, please vote for Seth Brown for Freshman Class Representative BETH DECKER person to see what J'rn really· ----------- like. I can tell you .that l have as much or more leadership experience over the last two years as any of my competitors. I have been president of various dubs and organizations and editor-in- chief of a major publication, in addition to captain of varsity wrestling. I am not going to sit here and dwell Oil! my past, rather. I am going to tell you what I have planned for the future. I want this position because I am a stromg willed and stubborn individaal who would like to repres~nt our class and make Unio11 College a school which aU mf us are proud of. We sllould nvt try to make Union into the school it onces was. as the upperclassmen wish, nor should we make this school into the \new and irnproved\ academic organizatio11 which the administration wa11ts. We, as a class, should make this school into the college we want it to be. We ~h()uld be able to put our rul.es and standards into effect,. because this is our school for the next four years. Let us rnak.e the decisions that gove:~n ()Ur life rather than the adm:ioistration. They are our employees, we should voice our Op!inion on what we want. I believe that the beauty behind having trimesters is that yon have rnore free time and less classes. I think you should be able to use this time the way ;fbu want to. If the administration is disrupting the social environment at Unioa, they should offer us appr()priate alternatives rather than taking away our freedom. I think opening up the Fero House to the students as .a social alternative is a staJt, tut we need much more. We s:hould be the ones to decide how we wish to spend our free time and not the administration. If they wish to make this school into an academic powerhouse they need to make appro<Jpriate provisions. I fmd it hard to call . Union a powerhouse ~hen our I, Beth Decker, am running for Freshman Class Representative on the basis that I know I have what it takes to effectively represent the class of 1996. Amidst student discontent with many of my High School's policies, I was instrumental in forming a group to a.) discuss problems in the school and b.) meet with administration to develop and institute new policies. I feel this experience, along with the responsibility and leadership abilities learned through my extensive involvement with school organizations will aid in my efforts to represent our class. This experience is particularly important now, amidst the wave of student discontent that bas swept over t11e Union Campus in reaction to the new Social Policy. We have four more years here at Union and we can not spend them dissatisfied with the social life. Administration took away a major part of the social life and an outlet for stress and anxiety here at Union when they banned mid- week fraternity parties. The only way to change this policy is to put pressure on the Student Affairs Council to review and modify the policy, and if elected this is what I fully intend to do. We need to find a compromise that will satisfy students needs for a social life and calm administration's worries ever alcohol related ·accidents and CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER ~9, 1992 • PAGE 4 ELECTIONS academic standing.

However, there could be more involvement that C()uld lead to a better feeling of achievement and a more positive feeling from the surrounding community.

Our challenges sllould be addressed through a willing and knowledgeable representative who will echo the opinions of the freshmen class! Vote RICB FUERST for freshmen representative!! STEVE LAPINSKI My name is Steve Lapinski, and I'm running for the position of Freshman Class Representative. In this position, my goal is to improve the conditions at Undon, both academically and socially. As freshman, we are alL iliDfainiliar with the way tltis school works.. Therefore, b<>asting a list of past accomJllishments and qualifications would be irrelevant What the Freshman Class needs is a rep!'eSentative who · will effecti~ely communicate with his or her peers, the administration, and the Student Forum. I believe it is important to voice the opinions, ideas, and complaints of the Freshman Class, as well as to keep them informed about what is happening in Student Forum. It is essential that each member of the class has a say in regards to the issues that will greatly affect them throughout their years at Union. By ·being an active and vocal representati·ve I will make this possible. On Friday, Vote STEVE LAPINSKI for Freshman Class Representative. Michael Rand As freshmen we are the new, young students on campus who probably have a lot of great ideas but very little influence and power to follow through with those ideas. It is necessary for our class to be as cohesive as possible so that the little power we have can be heard throughout school. Not only do we need a representative who is outgoing and responsive to the wants and desires of our class, but we also need someone who is willing to speak up in student govemment meetings .and be our voice. Since coming to Union I have heard from the upper classmen how the social life has become so much worse in comparison to how it use to be. I took offense when I saw the T-shirt, \I went to Union before it sucked, transfer while you can.\ It would be very hard to reverse the rules, but I can assure you that I will work my hardest to assure you that no new rules are added restricting our social lives. I also think that it would be very useful if the entire class was aware of went on in the student government meetings. I plan on issuing news letters updating the freshman class of all the issues covered that concern them. This way no one is left in the dark. All in all, the real issue right now is who will do the best job . representing us. I feel that I can do that. Thank you, Bill Shakos Dear Freshman, In High school, were you tired of having representatives who were timid and shy? Were you tired of them not accomplishing the goals you elected them to do because they intimidated by loud and dominate opposition? Well your frustration stops here at Union College. I , Billy Shakos, am just the candidate to help you get what you want done. I'm aggressive and hard- nosed. I will represent my peers. to the fullest extent • as proud to be freshman, rather than the novice rookies the upperc1assmen may l~ibel us to be.' I stand firm on all my views on issues. I believe that the socialization program the administration and the president have provided is insufficient. Fraternities should be allowed to ,provide students as well as freshman, with entertainment during the school week. Why can't the administration and the president allow only a certain amount of fraternities to have parties.? Is there not an alternative? Are you tired of having the administration and president taking the fun out of college? Well my prescience in office will influence change for the better social life of the student body. Many candidates in this race have basically the same views I do, but will they have the courage and charisma to stand up to such large body's as the administration and the president? Will they stand up and make it clear that we, the freshman, do not approve? With my aggressive style and fearless character, I will be the one to stand up for us. I will be the o11e who will make your comments heard rather than mumbled then dropped. I will be the o11e who will represent us with authority. CAROL MONTE My name is Carol Monte and I'm running for Freshman Representative. I feel tqat students should have more of a say and be more involved in administrative pctlicies. Students should know about changes that the administration .makes before they are implemented. Some of the policies. which I think are important include the grading system, social policies and student activities. I have had three years of experience representing my class in high school, and I served as President of the Student Council for one year. I will make sure that every member of our class can easily contact me whenever he or she has any ideas or suggestioos. I am a very determined and enthusiastic person and I feel that I would do the best job in .

New York. I am seeking election to the position of Freshman Representative. I have served as President of my high school class for two years in a row and Secretary for one year. During that time my class managed to raise the most money in recent history. We also planned and ran a trip to Boston, a prom, a carnival, and graduation. I feel that I can make a positive impact on our school environment, by listening to you and bringing your ideas to realization. I feel that I posses the necessary qualities to be a good leader: honesty. integrity, steadfastness, and experience. If elected, I will listen to all suggestions brought forward by anyone, and do what I can for them. For example. I have witnessed an overwhelming dissatisfaction with the current social policy changes. Similarly. I have seen a tremendous discontentment with the food served in the freshman dinning hall, as well as with the plastic and paper utensils used periodically. The utensils should all be reusable, including those used at Dutch Hollow. This school is in need of a more active recycling program, as the one we currently have is most ineffective. We need more recycling bins throughout campus and the buildings, including living areas. There should be at least one bin on each floor of the dormitories, in order to· encourage recycling. As a representative, I will do all I can to make. the necessary adjustments in order to please the most people. I will also do my best to make our school environment the best it can possibly be.

CONCORDJENSIS • OCTO,BER 29, 1992 • PAGE 6 Students On Brazil Term Witness Uprising continued from page 3 the police opened fire on the inmates, machine gunning anyone in sight--men inside and outside cells were killed, and their bodies showed marks of extensive dog bites and clubbings. Of the 111 inmates that have been confirmed by authorities to have been killed, eighty percent had not been found guilty of commiting crimes. Aaron Hoffman, a 1992 Union graduate, who has connections with the Sao PaUio medical school (it houses the morgue where the victims were taken), has learned tllat three hundred bodies were brought there from the House of Detention. Within this backdrop of formal democracy, greed and corruption, government repression, the faihre of justice, and screaming inequalities of wealth and political and social IJ<)wer, we progress with Union's term abroad to Brazil. I am very proud of Union College's students on this term abroad : They are curious, involved, and open. Tile students are talcing three classes-- all witb a good deal of reading, conducting field research (while strugglmg with a new language), travelling extensive distances to school and for research (usually by bus through traffic jams)~ learning to get along in :Brazilian families and with econom,ic inflation, and struggling to learn who they are: Brazil's many cultures and classes complicate the search for reality and self. The students are engaged in socially and politically important research; all focusing on contrib11tions and sacrifices of women to Brazilian development. Two students (Cladia David and Christa Kelleher) are working in the special police stations for battered women. Three other students are stndying African- Brazilian realities: religion-- Candomble-- (Jacques Etienne and Lauren Kohl); the triple discriminations against African-Brazilian women {Nadine Pendley). Another is examining Japanese Brazilians (Samantha Lobis) - Sao Paulo has the biggest Japanese community outside of Japan. One student (Julie Shanebrook) is examining discrimination against womern in the paid labor force. Another (Dass Seaman) is documenting the socio-cultural and structural organization inside Brazilian busses. The students' field ·research involves extensive participation, interviews and observation. Besides these research projects. the students have taken field trips--to survey informal sector economic activities in Sao Paulo City; to observe an Afro-Brazilian (Candomble) religious service; to have a Pai de Santo identify their Afro-Brazilian Saints (ORIXAS); to visit a little- researched community of direct descendents from slaves. Some of its members still speak . African (Bantu) dialects--the :ommunity leader is 108. On November 4 we will leave Sao Paulo for a research- study tour, including the Northeastern city of Racife (where we will participate in a Catholic (CEB) base (political- consciousness raising) community; to Salvador de Bahia City-where we will visit the OLODUM Bloco-- a musico-political community. Olodum was the drums on Paul Simon's Rhythm of the Saints album. Then, we will travel to the Federal Capital, Brasilia, where we will visit human and women's rights groups, and IT'S YOUR CHANCE TO STAND AND DELIVER THE 8TH ANNUAL PUBLIC SPEAKING COMPETITION PRELIMINARY NIGHTS: NOV.1,2 ,3 FINAL NIGHT: NOV. 4 SIGN UP IN THE COLLEGE CENTER .

He is the epitome of a politician. For the past couple of months he has told the country what they wanted to here for only one reason to ge~ elected. As Bush stated over and over, you can't do that as President of the United States, it just does not work that way. Clinton then tums to .his supporters and says that he is sick of people telling him he ca11.'t do this and he can't do tllat, and that he will get it done. Well Billy, far be it from us t(i) say you can't do the impossible. Listen, I know that this is not the most politically ·aware article in the whole world,. not even close. The fact is we as Union college students arc some of the most educated people in the country. We are certainly some of the most educated voters. The problem is, we don't make up the whole country. Not even a fair percentage. The people who live in the rural areas and the people without the know how to understand the issues listen to the press like it is the second coming ,)f Christ. The liberal media pushes Bill Clinton down their throat like it is cough medicine, and like the little kid with the bad cougll they accept it. the first to come out. Bush can handle this global need. Clinton can't handie the Arkansas national guard. The real truth is whoever gets elected will probably get us out of the economic downturn that we are in, and it won't be due to the president entirely anyway. The real question comes in when our economy is turned around. When this docs occur and the media decides to dictate our every thought again by turning to an international crisis, or to crime or whatever it may be next, who do we want in charge then. A man who feels Europe is just a place for anti-U.S war protests or a man who has the experience and loves his country enough to handle our everyday existence as Americans.

With Bill Clinton's lead dwindling in the wake of what some people viewe~ as a dominant performance by George Bush in the debates, suddenly the outcome is no longer a foregone conclusion. It's not that Governor Clinton has made any significant gaffes or mistakes, but with the success of Ross Perot's return polls have shown marked trends towards a tight contest. As it stands right now, Clinton holds the lead with 42%, President Bush is next with 31%, and Perot registers 19% support. Don't expect these numbers to remain constant through November 3- to say so would mean that someone (or thing) has a grasp on the fickle, changing nature of the American electorate.

Clinton knows? has a 41 o/o unfavorable rating Having said that, I 'tliink it woul-<1 be best to e.xa111ine a couple of the major tllelllies that have surfaced over th·e past montbs and assess whicla of the three- Bush, Clinton~ or Perot- have benefited most frcrm their presence in the electioiJ. There are too many out t.bere to forrnt~late an exhaustiV\e list, ratller th.e ones followin:g have (still lower than the President's), but it should balloon in tile face of more GOP attacks. As for Ross Perot, he has been hounded throughout by stories of his constant paranoia and tendency to scrutinize the backgrounds of his employees. This new statement on 60 Minutes that h.e made tho-ugh- about how he dropped out ()f tlle Presidential Clinton is not the great answer we are looking for. Our economy is bad ... fine I will .agree to that, but the whole world is on economic hard times ... THE WHOLE WORLD!! We just have to be Listen, all I am saying is that when you take the numbers away, and look at what our next President will do, Bill Clinton is not the answer, and if he is it must be a real stupid question. Truth race this summer for fear of the Republicans sabotaging his daughter's wedding- is ludicrous and will cost Perot any chance he might have had on Tuesday. · I give the nod here to Bush- while he has presided over a nagging recession and general discontent in this nation, he's come out and admitted when mistakes were made. I still 1 wonder where his answers are though. Economy- George Bush has been dogged by his own record. While Bill Clinton can claim (a bit dubiously I think) that he balanced 12 straight budgets in Arkansas as governor yet has a plan for renewed investment in American business, the President can only point to a Democratic Congress that turned a deaf ear to his domestic proposals. What Mr. Bush clrums is that he needs a Republican House of Representatives and/or Senate- then his agenda for American prosperity can be carried out. Meanwbile, Ross Perot's straightforward me.ssage of how he intends to cure the nation's economic woes· with among other things a gasoline tax- has hit a chord with the US puQJic. With his trademark wisecracks and sarcasm that Perot was able to showcase on nationwide television during the debates, people have come to identify him as a man able to make us number one again. Advantage to Perot. Finally if l had to make a decision on who has the best overall vision for our future, it would have to be that of Bill Clinton. The Democratic ticket has continually called for change and for new American direction in the wake of a failed Republican economic theory. In a recession such as ours, that is exactly what people want to hear. To stem the tide of what many see as a change of party in the White House, George Bush will have to make the greatest comeback in Presidential history. Is it out of the question? No, but we'll have to wait until Tuesday to find out. UNION 800 Block 3 2 Bedroon1 Bedroon1 l{oonls 1-Ieat Included 374-7806 $700 rnonthly $550 lllOHthly $150-$200 lllOHthly 393-2947 rnessagc

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 29,. 19.92 • PAGE 8 A Perspective Of AIDS At by Veronica Rog.ers Associate News Editor I have spent the last two weeks writing articles in preparation for and during AIDS Awareness Week that was held last week. Although I dido 't get a chance to go to all the discussions, I went to two tllat I thought were really interesting. The strange thing was that although both events were about AIDS and. AIDS education, they were presented in completely opposite fashions. The first day of AIDS Awareness Week I went to a bveakfast at the ungodly hour of 7:30 in the morning. The breakfast was for Henry Nichols, the twenty year old wilo has AIDS. I went with another editor from Concordi and when we walked in, I wasn't surprised to see that she and I were two of the only three or four Union students there. I can't say that 1 was disappointed, because I didn't expect too much more. I mean, the time slot wasn't very ideal. It was a strange atmosphere. I felt out of place because I had entered a scene that I was not accustomed to. I had pever met or seen anyone with AIDS (as f;u:-llS I lrnow). I was honestly a litlle apprehensive, but at the . ~ame time very corious. I got ' tn.!Y 11arne tag, and then found a 1;e;at. We were t(Jid that. we . 1;hrOllid go up and get some C(}tntlllental breakfast if we so. de:sire:d. •Going up I started feeling g11ilty. I didn't even know who Blertry Nichols wa~. and ret I s;taJtecd feeling guilty that I was he:altlly. I went liP to grab a bugel and some joice anyway. t:J:).'i!1g to disregard my na15ging fell:li11gs. What is the right way t() foeel in situati&n like tltis? No ome ever told me how te feel when I am face to face wi til a stranger wh.Q is dyrn~. I kn•O'\V people always say to just be y,ollrself, and act nonna1o, Holle~tly, though, when I was s:-tllndillg in back uf Henrr in l!i!le, I couldn't help tbi11k abtout the fact that he has this t~aib1e disease. I -didn't admit lll!f fi1ou~hts though, I felt as tilaJu~h I was mentally l>eing t~n:iait:'. I tried to keep my wits aotOut nie and I sat down for HeJUy's speech. I w.ras surprised at the tone of vodce that Henry 11sed duri11g h!~ whole discussi()n. It seemed as tbough it was either fr()m tile f11c1 that he had given bis SJJeeCII so many times, or fr()m his ~:ssible desire to not l(lt it be a sympathy s:peecil. He spoke eloquently and wa~ at times witty. His sister Jennifer reinforced his message !Jy need a reality check sho11ld have gone to see Henry. I would like to think that the reason almost no Um.ion students were there is beca11se of the time of day. The other event I wen.t to was of a completely diff~rent nature. Suzi Landolphi was not only funny. but she was OJlen, proving bow strong of a pers()n he had become during his illness. It was obvious that Henry did not want pity. He was there to tell the facts m an attempt to better inform pe()ple about HIV and AIDS. I understood the fact that Hem-y didn't want pity, and maybe I wasn't crying during his speech, but it was moving just the same. The fact that he is my age, and he is living with ' AIDS depressed me greatly. Henry wasn't my frrst reality check, but he was defmitel)' a big one. To honestly realize that <Jne is not immortal is a very scary thing. I don't know how many Union students are &till walking around with blinders, but if there are many, tbey better realize soon that they too can get AIDS, or get into a car accident if they drive drunk, or fan off a cliff if they get too . close. Sorry I am being 1 morbid, but ilife cannot be taken lightly~ a.nd all the· pe()ple on this campus who 1 easy gomg, anll informative. Tile Union tumout was very large, especially :for a Friday night.

Looking aroolld the audience I saw laughter caused by embarrassmellt of her explicitness, but I also saw the · falling of b31£'iers that many students put UIJ because of personal insecurities.

Althotlgh my life hasn't radically changed since her performance, it did give me a better perspective not only on myself, but on people and Union ·C()llege. At the end when we stood up in ovation for Suzi,. I actually felt pride for my schoo 1. It kind of reminde4 me of my high school. I had honestly forgottell what it felt like to be together as one school, one unit. Sure we go to Football games. an.d we cheer for the Rugby team. but when do we ever come together as a student body?

OONCORDIENSIS • OCTOBER 2CJi,. 1992 • PAGE 9 College Festivals Open New Doors for Advertisers by Shields Day Busines Editor ' Companies that sell products to college students are now finding out that there is a better way to get these students interested in their products. ln~tead of spending lots of money advertising in college magazines and newspapers, many companies are finding that the best way to reach the c&llege consumer is through a reg·iona1 college festival. At a college festival, companies purchase floorspace and set up booths in large exposition centers to promote their products. For a nominal five· dollar entrance fee, a C()Jiege student can gain entrance to a barrage of freebies, food and attractions where they can see the latest in fash.ion, video and music industries. Almost every booth has some sort of gimmick to give ou1 such as posters, perfume, baseball hats, etc. plastered with bright company logos. Alcng with the gimmicks, most bo<>ths have raffles which can give away some pretty e~pensive prizes - i.e. a pair of B()se speakers. This new method of reachinp; tlhe ·college consu:mer is quickly becoming the hot new tJend because companies are seeing tbe value in advertising directly with college students. The (;ollege consumer is often a . t()Qgh sell due to lack .of money, and is strongly influenced by ;trends. A product can easily become an ()vernight success on college campuses and companies are aware of this possibility. Also, l>y targeting college kids at a young age, t:be quality companies are likely to get a satisfied, pennanellt customer for years to come. A magazine adv.ertisement d()es not let the consumer touch, feel and handle the products, which is so crucial for many product's success. ln a recent college festival in B.oston, the students get a chance to manhandle the product which will often lead to a sale. The take home gimmicks are also successful in keeping the companies name in tile student's mind. Recently, a college festival jm Boston attracted 19,000 :students from the l()cal ·colleges ~there are roughly about 40 .colleges in the Boston area). :Everyone who attended, both. :students and comJ>anies, felt that the festival was a huge success. Local rock bands were hire<! to play at the festival to help create a party atmosphere. Even local celebrities were there to shake hands and sign autographs . The live music and celebrities helped students to forget they were at a large scale advertisement campaign pw::ely desig11ed to sell s~udents all the trendy, fashionable merchandise a college student could want. For us here in the Capital District, a college festival similar to the one in Boston is not oat of the question. With so many C()lleges in the area - Union, SUNY Albany, RPI, Saint Rose, Sienna, and Skidmcre - Albany \YOUld be a great s:pot for a similar festival. With a11y Iuck, we may soon have one here in Albany. The agencies who promote these events prefer locations up and down the eastern seaboard especially in the New England and New York area. If you get the chance to attend one of these eve.llts, strongly consider attending, they are a lot of fun and who kn.ows, with any luck you may e11d up winning the grand prize.

An option is a retreated further. contract to buy or sell a stock Most people by now have heard or read in one place or aoother that we are headed for a Bear market. The argument has Qeen made time and time again that U.S. stocks are overvalued and overdue for a major price adjustment. This argument is supported somewhat by the Dow's retreat from a record high of 3414 dJJring the summer to its present levels. The market index has been hovering between 3150 and 3200 for the past week or so. How d()es Wall Street absorb all of this? Many traders and investors are c<>ntrarians and believe that wben Bearishness reaches the levels we see now, a major rally is on its way. Several major indicators of at a given ~rice. If a stock is ·expected to rise, a call option, or the rigllt to buy a stock, can be purchased. If tile price of the stock rises, the value of the call optioll increases. A put option is a contract to sell a stock at a given price. If the stock's price falls, the value of the put increases. The high levels of short interest ancl put options on the market llave sparked the interest of many C()ntrarians. However, the market still remains a prisoner of political uncertainty_ It is unlikely that the Dow will rise to a new record or that the market will crash anytime soon. The market is still waitillg to see which candidate will become president wd how his policies will affect the economy.

[t was :parked, innocently enough, in the lot behind my fraternity, Psi Upsilon. This was the. second incident of theft from my car within the past twelve months, the first of which involving the theft of. a radar detector. However, my car has not been the ollly one hit by tllleves in this lot. The Lamomt House parking lot has been the scene of qaite a few crimes. An()ther brother in Psi Upsilon had his car stolen last spring. It has not been recovered~ nor is)t expected to be. There have been nwnerous other car stereo .and radar detector thefts, but there has been no n()ticeable change in preventative action taken by ()Ul' security force. Pleas~ do not take my personal frustration in the wrong manner, I do realize there ex:ists no simple solution to this growing problem, but r llave als() heard of no groups being fonned to helppat a stop to such despicable action. Upon discovering last week's theft, I was outraged. At that point, 1 couldn't understand why President Hull had called for the demoliti()n of the wrought iron fence su.rrounding campus. I was determined to start a group that W()uld be responsible for raising enough. m<>ney to finish the structure. However, .as my mood calmed, rationality carne back into perspective and I realized how utterly useless this project would be. It would further alienate us from the local population, all for the sole reason of stereotyping everyone in Schenectady llS criminals. My feelings of anger are slowly dying down, but I still would like to see some sort of response from either the administration or security towards curbing sU:ch on campas incidents. For the price we pay to C()me to this institution, we should have some sort of gaaranty for t:he safety of <>ur personal items. I would like to work towards finding a solution, or some sort of compromise fer this on campus plague. It should be neglected no longer.

Let me also add that this is my- primary purpose, to s1art a wcussion in which both voices are heard and responded to with respect. In that vein, I wish to respond to the letter that aJ>peared in last wee:k's Concordiensis. I speak only from my experience and those around rne who have been kind enough to share their feelings on what apJJears to be an issue with no f()rthcoming resolution~ We live in a patriarchal society; ili.s is fact. Neither men,. nor wo01en, have chosen tlle roles in which we've been placed. As far as the suggestion tliat talk is cheap, wbile oftell true, is not so in this case, tile patll to taking action is often ,through .,. expression. Silence equals death. As lorng as t:l!e condition of silence · can or will change. Maybe in tllis way we can use a forum more conducive to discussion and thought than the bathroom wal~. All great actians have been started with small beginnings, and as I've stated before, this is my aim, a true dialogue. But perhaps the most telling example of the conS}}iracy of silence. is the fact that while Mr. Fiol sent hi!; letter addressed to the editor of the Concordiensis for pub-lication, 1 recently received a letter from a woman student, who while praising me for my insights, sent it to me personally. Her fear of public expression, perfectly exemplifies tile biggest question, why are women scared to address this issue, and claim their feelings ~f confusion or anger? :Perhaps, the answer is as sirq.ple as she states, she was afraid. Unfortunately, women who speak out on gender disparities are often labelled man haters and ignored. Or maybe there's more. I don't know. I know that I write because someone should to tell the story, a:nd yes, it does help me. 'llle:se are confusing times, all :previously. assigned and accepted roles are out the window. These days; EVERYONE feels sc:ru-ed and alone, disassociated fr()m what was once a give11;: 'Who we were supposed to be, In a lot of ways, the freedolll! t() <:hoose has been given, onlr t.o be met with more confusion. No one knows who to bee. But I believe the restructutling has to start without fear, f()rbo:th men and women, since vre didn't choose these mote wisely. The blame does not rest 011 one or the other~ but on .everyone. The separation o11Ey further hinders the very thillg to which we attain; communicativn and a sense of connectio11. As Rodney King said in the aftermath of the t..A. riots, \Isn't there some wa..y to work this out together?\ l'h<>pe so. Oh, and one brief per$nal note to Mr. Fiol, perhaps tl!ere are more conducive enviro11ments to meeting such a \WOman as you desire than at a bar at 4:00 A.M., she's not gciinll to be there. RESPECT FOR THE KELLY'S NEIGHBORHOOD To the Editor:: In tlte recent past, Kelly's Pub has been e:xtremely criticized by the city council for allowing the misc()ndnct of patrons outside my establishment. In response, I have JJOSted a list of rules in the ba.r which asks customers to res:pect tlle residential character uf the Hattie Street neighborhood, and conduct themselves in a quiet manner upon leaving Kelly's, especially ·tale at night when most of the neighbors are sleeping. This year's group of students, who regularly IJatronize Kelly's , has proven themselves to be very resJlOnsible in this reJ!llrd, and I want to thank th.em for showing respect f()r the neighborhood, a11d their vatronage.

CONCORDIENSIS • OCTOIBER 29, 19'9:2 • PAGE 11 Union Will Miss Greg Gifford To Tbe Editor: A few days ago we foUild,out . that Assistant Profess or -oregory Gifford had boon denied tenure after appealhng the original negati\Ve recommendation of the Faculty Review Board. I feel bad for Greg because :he enjoys teaching. However., I am sure be will have ;no trouble employment on the outside. He is that good ;an engineer. I feel worse for Uniam College, the Civil Engineeri11g Department, and the studemts . Greg won't have tile opportunity to iilfluence~ They are the real losers. It is unfortunate that some of Otur faculty colleagues, and some administrators let feelings and petty politics get in their way of seeing Greg Gifford's tr11e value to Union College. Greg's combination of theoretical knowledge a11d practical field experience make him a valuable asset to a11y engineering education progam. The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology is pushing for more practitioner involvemeiit in engineeri11g educmticm. Gr~g fits their defillificon of a desirable engfu.eerillg educator perfectly. He i& •ail excellent teacher, an active J>ractitioner and he documents his cuttiQg-edge work irn literature. It would be nearly impossible to find anotlte:1 engineering educator with his qualifications. Howev-er, I doubt that we will be atltJ\Wed to hire a similar replaoeement. The college adrnimi:stration doesn't seem to want :t.o hire engineers who w<>ulcl' ~JJring strong practical experien<:e into the classroom. They 1\J~uld rather hire freshly minte<t l'hD's wbo wouldn't know a :percolation test .pit if they fell into one. I b;rwec seen people wbo are m11ch 'Loess qualified than Greg get teniJI\e. It saddens me that we are losing Greg because of the p~r:Sllnal animosities of few membe:rs of the Union College cornm11nity. I w<ish Greg the best in his futuree11:deavors.

Adrenaline has replaced tears for residents who pick up the· pieces of :their lives as well as of their homes. It's hard to find someone who has not been effected. The South Florida I saw does not desewe abandonment. The troops have been ordered away, and tent cities, closed. Surely, people need' to be helped back to independence, rather than robbed of dignity by fostering dependency, not there before. But, 20,000 people have been literally dumped on the doorstep of Mision Santa Ana in Naranja,. near Homestead. These are typically hardworti.n~ people. Decent. but poor ..

ARRESTS ON SALE 1N THE COlLEGECENIEROClOBER 28TH-NOVEMBER 5'JH, $3.00 THE FAST F:OOD REVIEW by Tad Lee CIJncordieMis Staff This week's lucky recipient · of my g~lden palate is Burger King. Specifically, I will review tile Burger King on EerieBhd. As yoa may know from the televisiOil advertisements, BK : now brings your food to tile 1 table. The service is decent, but not extremely fast. the place was clean enough and the bathrooms-well, 'I didn't go 1 into tb.e batlirooms. They have 1 an indoor ;playground, but they will ask you to get off the slide if you ue over the age of twelve. The clientele is a little ominou~ .. but nobody will bother you if you wear one of those BK GrOWIIS. Now fox the food review. As far ~s I'm concerned. the · chicken stmdwich is the best around. 1m 1 not talking about the Itat:iat~ e>r the flame broiled . or anything, just the plain old chicken sandwich. Their \Chicke11 Tenders'\ are excellent Bur~.er King also, altltoltigiB ,their sa11ces leave a lift!~ to be desired. They malcec::h:iclen McNuggets taste like d:1i~d up rubber cement (f() .. Jade of a better simile). AJtltrnn.giJ McDonald's has better S;I~caes, if you want fast food cllli.Ckett, BK is the place to 1!0 Burgers_ JiLne broiled, then microwav-ed. !'lketchy, but pretty g~ :tc!~>:ti11g. If yo11're really bung~.., tile Whopper is consistent J)W good, but consistent!~ ,fllessy. If you want chee-se or. iit you have to ask. If y~u ..vant a smaller version of :tile V~opper, order the Chees.ebooge:r Deluxe, it's quite gooll .<~rnd a personal favorite. 'Jbe- llacon-double cheesebur~e:r js aJso among the ·best thi11gs affered .by BK, although :y.ota llave to apply your C...Vill '~etchup.

I didn't ~trcy. 111nJ' of the new stuff like- !llkrLnp because I . didn't want to. It looked pretty good but fast food burger place~ just shouldn't handle seafoCJd. That's why I stay away from their Whaler fish sandwich., and the Fillet-o-fish from Micky D's ( fast food slang for McDonald's.) Fries at BK are rarely any good. If you get them fresh, then tlley are good and hot. But for some reason if they've sat for more than a min11te they simJ)l:y taste horrible, and tltey sag lilce .. .forget it. Sodas are fine. Order a small soda becallse you refill your own drinks. There's no point in buyinlJ anything bigger unless you're really lazy ( drive-thru window not included). If you're p(Jor you can always order a water and get an empty cup..,e(l()ugh said. BK ()n Eerie Blvd. I give it seve11 an<l a half stars out of ten. It's good stuff and the drive-tllru window is open until two AM on Saturday night. Can't beat it.

These problems. may be trigge:red by stress or 111ay be the result of a lifetime of sleep difficulties. Here are a few exami>les of sleeping dysfunction that many individual~ suffer from. People suffering fi:on sleep apnea syndromes usually have a blockage of the upper airway that cat~ses them to stop breathi11_g at intervals througho11t the night. Over a period of time, the apnea often becomes seriously sleep- deprived and may experience excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep apnea sufferers also may have frequent nocturnal awakeui11gs and can <levelop heart and lung complications that coul([ be life thre2tening. Most people who snore have, or will develop, sleep apnea. However, it can also <lCCur in non-snorers. The a:irway obstruction associated with this disorder may be caused by obesity, by the resting Jll.ace of the tongue, or by other physiol().gical factors.

N arcoleptics also experience numerous sleep disruptio11:s during the night. Nocturnal Myoclonus, or, \restless legs\ is a comm~n disorder typified by jerking muscle movements of the legs and feet which occur tluoughout the night and disturb nonnal sleep patterns. The movements may be of such short duration that they hardly awaken the person. However, this disorder often affects the sleep patterns ofbed partners and the sufferer's fragmented sleep results in daytime drowsiness. Another problem frequently encountered is difficulty iaitiating and maintainin~ sleep. Researchers have discovered that there are many reasons why people have trouble falling and/or staying asleep, and have made numerous advances in the treatment of this disorder. There may be many causes- stress, general depression, or poor sleep habits. Treatment of this problem is usually based on its specific source. Some people have difficulty sleeping during normal bedtime hours. The most common reason for this problem is known as \delayed sleep phase.\ In most of the population, the body temperature peaks in the evening, falls around bedtime and rises in the morning. With delayed sleep phase, the body's internal clock (the circadia11 rhythm system) and temperature varies from this standard. Significant advances have been made in treating this disorder. Behavior modification and innov.ative ])right light ·therapy~ appropriately scheduled.~ actually ,can reset the internal clock. I Parasomnia refers to a ;. disorder that occurs in conjunction with sleep- sleep walking, night terrors, teeth 1 grinding, head banging, sleep paralysis, and bed-wetting. Most parasomniacs do not recall these sleep episodes. While parasomnias occur with relative 'frequency in children, they may also occur in adults and treatment is determined after evaluation. Sleepillg disorders can be examined through monitoring brain waves, muscle activity~ breathing patterns, oxygen levels and heart rate. S orne disorders require daytime evaluation using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). During this test, 20- minute naps are ,taken and documented 5 times doring the day. Also, sleep apnea patients may be monitored on the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device (CPAP). This test determines the right airway pressure necessary to keep the ' upper airway open during sleep. After the diagnosis of a sleep{wake disorder has been established, treatments can ' begin. This can include behavior modifica.tion, medication. and surgery or the use of devices which open the upper airways and assist breatlling. · For further information on sleep/ wake disorders, contact the Capital Region Sleep!\V ake Disorder Center at (518) 436- WAKE.

HERO, A ZERO .•. • l .- • • • _,..,.-\;; r· . ,. . ·\.\·\' .. .;.. ·= .. by Carrie Sber~J~.an Arts Editor This movie is a prime example of a film with an all star cast that has a script that :is completely lacking. The cast in this film included; Geena Davis, Dustin Hoffman, Andy Garcia, and Chevy Chas~. Unfortunately, these talented actors were one of the few good qualities the film possessed. Hero is a story about a man,. Barney LePlant(Hoffman), who is not going far in life(to put his situation mildly). He does not have a job and has resorted to cheating and stealing to make .his way in the world. Barney is the ultimate pessimist. On his way to visit his son. he happens to bump into a plane crash. When a man driving in his car bumps into a plane crash this is usually a sure sign th.at the movie is going to start ,getting absurd soon. After listening to cries for help from the ,plane, Barney decides it is worth it to ruin his stolen shoes and help these people. LePlant is overcome by\ goodness\ and lle risks his life to run in and out of the ·plane several times and saves the stranded passengers. One of the passengers be rescued was Gale. the beautiful news repor:ter(Davis). She begins to .go on television and asks that the mystery man come forward. The television station offers a one million dollar reward to this hero. While all this is taking place, Barney is in jail and John( Garcia} steps forward and professes to be the hero. He is believed and soon the world( and especially Gale) begins to treat John like god. This part of the movie is completely unrealistic. A hero like this might make the news, .people might admire him, but most likely he would be ·forgotten after a few days. In :the movie Jolm is admired at1d is the major news story for weeks. This movie has a good plot but it is exaggerated out of realistic proportions .. Although there is a good cast and some funny scenes tile unrealistic nattlre of the film takes away from the fllm. If you, despite my opinions, wish to see this movie, take my advice and wait for it to come to campus. TOP TEN COSTUMES by Cindy Hills Contributing ~riter . In lieu of our adjusted Halloween weekend.

The motley ciew rnanifests itself as the best team in the business, and is approached by members of the Nllti<>nal Security Agency who need them to steal an intemati<>nal decoding device. The plot ,thickens when it turns out that the device is being hunted by several entities with powelful interests. The group gets i11volved in a scheme far bigger than they had imagined and s() the road begins to get themselves out. .. Redford (Out of Africa) is solid in the lead role as the former hacker unable to stay out of the ~arne. His perforrnance is b11ffeted by Mary McDonnell (Dances with Wolves). Sidney Poitier (To Sir, with Love) and Dan Aykmyd (Spies Like Us). Ben Kingsley (Ghandz) is ominous as the an tag on ist, a organizational megalomaniac. River Phoenix (Stand By Me) is somewhat dwarfed by the others, but with such a talenteo cast and with so many leading roles, it's difficult to develop every:character fully. Sneakers has Robinson's touch of poignancy, with .plenty of comic relief thrown in. A director who also writes the screenplay has an easier time of portraying the characters, because they are his own, and not borrowed from the imagination of someone else. It is obvious that these characters have Robinson's talented signature on them. and he gauges the reactions of the audience accurately, giving plenty of well mixed comedy, suspense and action. I give Sneakers an A- Whether you see it now or save the five bucks and catch it on campus next semester, ·definitely don't miss it.

LEO (July 23-August 22) Make time for work this week, though your in- clination is to li\'e out the theme of . your sign: LOVE. You come down with an early case of Spring Fever, or 1 (ex.cuse me) you already have one. You plunge into the weekend, primed and ready. It's that old saying, the more, the merri-er. VIRGO (August 23-September 22) Check with yourself and know - before you start 01' whole brouhaha - that you ''re coming from a centered space. Build on your security. Know what you want in the long run. Listen . to your higher self and roll with the punches. Keep doing that all weekend long. LIBRA (September 23-0ctober 22) Talks reveal another side, and you are able to move a situation in a different and happier direction. You feel good as the weekend comes on (phew!). Make the most of the playful moments, the flirtation and the gooey eyes. There is nothing like a Libra in love SCORPIO (October 23-November 21) Watch expenditures, investments and feeling like you have to keep up with the Joneses. It's also wise for you to stay mum and act like you know nothing. You may be shocked at some of the things you hear. Spend the weekend recuperating, hopefully in the company of another. SAGITTARIUS (November 22- December 21) Make this one of your more upbeat weeks. Your personality radiates; you feel great and all goes well, if you just remain sensible - no walks on the wild side. A weekend chat can help a relationship. If single, join friends, have dinners in cozy spots, be available. CAPRICORN (December 22- January 19) You carmot seem to get off the roller coaster ride. But once you gc through the valley this week, you rise to the pinnacle. Though every day can- not be that great, there is certainly no reason for investing in tissues. Be care- ful with wildness in general this weekend. AQUARlUS (January 20-February 18) You're up; you're down. You don•t know. Expect to be moody and contrary - you just might surprise yourself. In the darkest moment, as the weekend begins, comes a glimpse ot change. You have a whole other opinion by Monday: \Life is so wonderful.\ PISCES (February 19-March :20) Make the most of the work week, though please, Pisces, pace yourself if you are going to get any enjoyment at all froni the weekend. You will need to recharge those batteries. since you have been so busy scurrying here anJ there. Vanish with a favorite, \live·

Is Yet To Com.e by Pat Stre<k Centributi118 Writer To talk alxrut the individual games played by the Union Men's Soccer']eam would take the better part ()f this paper. Instead, let'S co11centrate on the guys who mak.>C l!P the squad. The captain~. Lee Popper and Dan Wiltnot. At first g-lance, neither one would be cast as a socce:r:(ilayer. Popper looks more like~· Wlt'estler than a goalie and Vfilm@t appears to have wrestled with nothing more than ake g bere and there. However, get them on the field and you quic~ly change your mind. Dan has 111(:)re ~peed than you would gu.ess and a great touch when taking free kicks. The hard part ()f w.riting about this senior is that his consistent, solid :play is exactly that. He doesn't create the big plays but, more importantly, he doesn't let his man make them either. Lee is roCk ootid in goal and, if anything, he's to blame for some of the l.4pses in the defense this yea-. T:he comfort of having someone as good as him in goal can make a defender play \With a little less concentratioa. The one question I hav-e for the junior captain is, \Witic:b w:ay was the wind blowing at MIT: Pop?\ The only otlter senior on the team is Joel Volterra~ another defender. Joel plays a very solid game, evell ·when he gets shifted from sp-ot to spot in the backfield as h~ ()[ten ·been the case this seas()n. Good as he is, the Iastin15 fllemory that Volterra leaves. may wen be of when, in a scrin1ma..,ge against the Albany Warriors, the heat was so intense <>n the bench that he was forced to sprawl out shirtless anti work on his tan. Also on defellse we find to Dave Chodos(;IJ, The best marking back on the team, Chodosch alwa::ys gets the most dangerous play-er from the other team ~s his: mark. Likewise, that player tends to score only once in a blue moon. Also, ::O~ve has been injured most of tile season with chronic back pl'oblems and other things. Stilt, he sat out for the first time against St. Lawrence this weekend. Imagine when lie'~ healthy. The other upper-class defender is \ll<Je:f\ Stu Polk. Originally coming. in off the bench, Beef secured himself a spot as the stlllting sweeper when he took over the defense in Union's 4-3 overtime· win' at MIT. He may be good, but he still looks like he's doing some new dance step whenever he kicks the ball. Moving to the midfield we find Jeff \Aaaruugh\ Mela, If you find him late at night at ·Chi Psi with a big mug tied to his wrist, that's about he only sound he can make. Playing soccer though. he's a force at center-half. Also playing injured, he has had a tough season. He finally had a career game .against Rochester when he dominated the game pmviding an assist and a spectacular unassisted goal. Two sophomores, \Chicken\ Stu Savage and Kevin \Wheels\ Wilmot work with Mela. These two have provided much of the scoring this season as well as supporting the offense ahead of them and the defenders behind. Om.e of their best combined games came against Siena. Wilmot scored the opening and tying goals of the game, forcing overtime. Siena quickly scored only to have Savage score two in succession to tie and win the game. Just so that Jeremy Liebhoff doesn't feel left out, he did ice that Siena game with a rocket of a goal. That's this forward's trademark, raw power. In the MIT game, he scored on the ricochet of his own penalty kick. He mistakenly thought it was possible to put the ball through the goalie.. , His partner, Mark \Ole\ Oleson, has had a good season up front. Like most of the team, he has been playing through a succession of injmies ranging from bruises to bites. Yes, some kid tried to remove a portion of Ole's arm with his teeth. Mark had the game winner against MIT, as well as other key goals this season. Two key upperclassmen come in off the bench. One is Byron \Skates\ Smith. A hockey player who runs like he's wearing his blades, Big Bad Byron likes to make his presence felt whenever he's out on the field. l'hat usually means that someone is gonna get bounced, stepped on, or just plain beat up. The other guy is Casey \Crash\ Kurz, one of those quiet types who'll ron you ragged on the field. Not afraid of anyone, Case will challenge anyone and you often wonder how he hasn't gotten burt yet.

Women's Tennis Celebrates Fantastic Season by Racllel Goldrme, Elissa Katz amd 'Blare Spritzer Contributing Writers The Women's Tennis Team had another great season. The season began at the RPI Tournamellt where the team placed second, only one point behind Clarckson. There were four single players and two doubles teams. Sophomore. T ulie Anderson, captured the number ()lle singles victory over Clarkson in three tough sets. Junior, Blaire Spritzer, made it to the finals after losing to Clarkson. Senior Captain Elissa Katz and Spritzer defeated Clarkson at number two doubles. Anderson and Sophomore Rachel G()ldfine lost in the finals to Clarkson at the number one doubles position. The Women's Tennis Team received its first trophy for Union. This year .the team had many accomplis1J.ments including a victory over Skidmore for the first time in seventeen years. They ended the season with an 8-4 record. During the regular season A11derson played first singles followed by fellow Sophomore Chantal VanSaher. Katz played third, Spritzer fourth, and Goldfine fiftb. SOCCER, co:nt. from page ~() bounces clear of the falling bodies. Now we come to the freshmen. The two most promi11ent are Matt Stern(Author's Note: I'd use a nickname but for personal reasons I <lecline to do so) and Vin \V -Man\ Obermeier. Stern starts at left wing halfback while Obermeier gets a fair 'Share of playing time in the backfield.

Mid-Season by Rich ·Morgan Co-Sports Editor Bills ~ Dolphins B+ B+ With the season halfover, a number of teams look forward . to the second half with bopes of a post-season invitation. · For a few teams, however, it is going to be a long winter {and you thought George Washington had it bad).

A- Both of these teams h~ve continued their resurgence which began late last season. The 49ers have domin:ated their opponents offensively, where they continue to light up the scoreboard. Dallas, as well, has put to good strategic use their versatile offense, while holding the oppone11fs rushing game to a bare minimum.

Still~ there is very little reason to believe that the Bills will not regain their true form that has kept them on top of their division for the past four years. Contrarily, the Dolphins faltered the whole day against the Colts on Sunday-it only seemed appropriate that a missed extra point by Stoyanovich would lead to their first loss of the season. Hopefully for Dolphins fans, this game was not an omen for how the team from Miami would fare the rest of the season.

Pittsburgh manhandled the Chiefs on Sunday night, which gave . them a share of first place with the Oilers. Talk about defense?

B+ Redskrns B+ Eagles Both Washington and Philadelphia trail the Cowboys by a single game in the NFC East. Both teams share a similar flaw, which is winning on the road. Wher~as both teams are a perfect 4-0 at home, they have losin~ records on the road. They must overcome this adversity in order to remain atop the NFL Elite. The Redskins, though a powerhouse in the NFL. is suffering a temporary setback: the inefficiency of their starting QB, Mark RYJlien. He failed to score a touchdown this past week aga.inst the Vikings~ and remains as one of the leagues lowest rated quarterbacks.

Josh Haines finished 74 out of 150, with a time of 29:33, Bill Weir ran an impressive 30:33, and Aaron (Sh~lves) Krochmal PR'ed by over a minute with 34:18. Then the varsity team took to the course, posting soli<l performances all around. . With a team spread (first thwugh fifth runners) of only 2:07., this is definitely one of tile .strongest teams Union has field~d in the past few years. Russ Stram and John Metz both ran sub-30 going 29:08 and 29:29 respectively. Mitch Weisenberg finished 169 with a PR of 30:18. Next, Marc Sheridan and Tom Duckett finis.hed 174 and 176 with Adam Russell running 6th.

CONCOROIENSIS • OCTOBER 29, 1992 • PAG~ 23 NHL Update: Lemieux and Pens - On Fire By Hal Poret Co-Sports Editor pace. Is this for Feal? Going back to last season's playoff's, the Penguins have not lost in 20 games (18-0-2). The ----------~,, Edmonton Oilers opened the loss to Montreal, goal-tender Stephane Beauregard stopped only 2 first period shots, giving up goals to Mike Keane, Brian Bellows, Matthieu Schnieder and Gilbert Dionne. He was replaced by Dominic Roussel who gave up three more goals including 2 to Denis Savard who leads the Habs with 18 points. The Flyer power-play is Two weeks of hockey are over and several teams are starting to establish themselves as teams to keep an eye on. The Pittsburgh Penguins, at 7- 0-2, look almost untouchable as they had won six straight as . of Tuesday, blowing most of. their opponents off the ice. Through nine games the Penguins are averaging 5.51 goals· a game while giving up · only 3 pe1· game. Superstar centerman Mario Lemieux has scored an unbelievable 12 goals and 18 assists in his first nine games to lead the league with 30 points. Lemieux has scored at least one goal in each game and has had no less than 2 points in any game. If Lemieux were to keep up this impossible pace he would finish with 112 goals and 280 points, ·and shatter both of Wayne Gretzky's marks. Gretzky scored 92 goals in his record-setting season. Teammate Kevin Stevens, possibly the best American player in hockey, is second in the league in scoring with 10 goals and 12 assists. Poor Kevin, is only on pace to pass Gretzky' s mark by one goal. Finally, Jaromir Jagr brings up the rear with 6 goals and 12 assists. Jagr is on a 56 goal 1984-85 season with a 15 game unbeaten streak, and the Pens need 6 more to match that mark .... However, Pittsburgh :plays in Hockey•s best division, the Patrick, and the New York Rangers lag only 3 :points behind in the standings. . . The talented Rangers are 6-2-1 but are unbeaten in their last four (3-0-1). Fonner Penguin Phil Bourque has been a significant contributor, with 3 game-winning goals. including one with 21 seconds left in overtime to give the Rangers a 3.-2 win over Ottowa on Sunday. John Vanbiesbrouck bas been excellent at home in goal, but the constant shuffling a pitiful 1 for 28 on the road The Bmins are off to a fabulous 6-1-1 start scoring over five goals and game and getting decent goal-tending. Rejean Lemelin stopped 23 shots, rookie Dimitri K va.Ftalnov scored 2 goals, and Olympian Ted Donato scored in a 5-3 win over Vancouver earlier this week. The Bruins look very impressive on top of the Adams with two games in hand .... Montreal, led by Denis Savard, is 1 point hack at 5-3- 2. The Canadiens win with a balanced attack and solid goal- of goal-tenders still has the Rangers on unsteady ground ..... The Islanders, in third place at 5-3-1, show much promise for the future. The Isles looked impressive in their home-opener, blowing out the Rangers, behind a great performance in goal by Glenn Healy. Pierre Turgeon leads the Isles with 16 points, but this is ' tending from Patrick Roy. a multi-talented team. Benoit Hogue and Derek King have both been excellent, as well as Russian stars Malakhov and Darius Kasparaitus.. ... Eric Lindros and the Flyers continue to score, led by Mark Recchi 's 16 points, but have had problems in net. In a 7-6 Seven different Canadiens scored in their 7-6 win over Philadelphia .... Pat LaFontaine is off to a fabulous start, leading the Buffalo Sabres with 7 goals and 14 assists through 8 games. LaFontaine is third in the league in points, and Buffalo is in third place at 5- 3 .... The Quebec Nordiques started off brilliantly at 4-0 led by great play by Joe Sackic and Owen Nolan, but have cooled off and are 4-3-1 and in 4th place .... After winning its first NHL game, the Ottowa Crew Team Gearing By Steve Mooar Staff Writer The Union College Crew Team bas its final race of the Fall season on Saturday, October 31st, at the Head of --the Fish Regatta. This will be the first race in two weeks for the Crew Team, whose last race was the Bausch & Lomb Invitational Regatta in Rochester. ·At the Bausch & Lomb they faced the top crew powerhouses in The United States and Canada. The competition included Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, and many more. Faced with high Towards Final Race caliber competition the Varsity Men's Eight and the Varsity Women's Eight did not do well in the final standings. however after two races only seconds separated the Union Crews from local rivals, such as Skidmore and Colgate. The Crew Team has spent the last few weeks l>ecoming acquainted with the coaching techniques of new Head Coach Jim Crick. Jim's background includes coaching crews at the University of Vermont and Tufts University, and a competitive career as coxswain at Harvard and Tabor Academy. The only member left from last years coaching staff is Jim Swab, Women's Varsity Coach. The Head of the Fish Regatta is held each year on Saratoga lake, approximately 45 minutes from the Union Campus. The races are scheduled to begin at 9:00 AM and run through to 4:00 PM. To get to the race, take the Northway (I-87 north) to exit 14. Make a left off the ramp onto route 9P and then a right onto Crescent Av. The race is held at. the Waterfront Restaurant and there should be .signs for the race. Come and cheer for all the crews, including the undefeated Men's Novice Eight! Senators have dropped seven straight, only averaging 2 goals a game while giving up 5 per game. Elie Vianelli has shined for Ottowa with 8 points. Two unlikely teams, Toronto and Minnesota sit atop the pitiful Norris at 5-3-1 (the Islanders are in 3rd place in the Patrick with the same record). Toronto, probably inspired :by the Blue Jays, have won five of their last six, mostly because of the outstanding play of Doug Gilmour (6 goals, 13 assists) .... The expansion Tampa Bay Lighting look · impressive at 4-4-1, led by Cluis Kontos' 8 goals, roolde Tom Hochberg's 12 points, and good goaltending from Wendell Young .... The Blackhawks are still reeling from their destruction in the Stanley Cup finals at the hands of the Penguins. They are at 3- 5-l and have lost to Tampa Bay twice, giving up 15 goals in their 2 meetings with the Ligh.tning. Ed Belfour has been weak in goal, and thus Jimmy Waite has been given three starts, winning two of them .... The Calgary Flames increased their lead in the Smythe Division with a 4-0 shutout of the Edmonton Oilers this we0kend. Gary Leeman scored two goals and AI Macinnis added a goal and an assist as the Flames improved to6-3. The Flames have won 6 of 8, while Edmonton is off to the worst start in its fourteen year history .... Pavel Bure leads the third place Canucks in scoring, while Kirk McLean's goal-tending has held Vancouver up .... The Kings are missing Way11e Gretzky who needs back surgery and may\ retire, but Luc Robitaille and J arri Kurri have picked up th.e slack. and the Kings look g()oo in 2nd p\Iace. Looking towards the futme, one can almost ignore the miserable Cambell Conference and focus on the talent in the Wales. Tile Pittsburgh P~nguins ha'Ve proven beyond a doubt ll-.at they are no j0ke. Pittsburgh hopes to win their third straight cup, but will undoubtedly fa<:e fierce competition from tile Rangers who may be better ()ff in the underdog role, and tile [slanders who are always tougll with Pittsburgh. The Bmifls and Canadians are certainly forces in the Adams, but tne Patrick teams just seem to get better and better. The old NHL playoff format did not have divisional playoffs, but rather. the team with the best record played the tcarn with the 16t:h best record and so on. It is unfortunate that now, the twc best teams in hockey, the Rangers and Penguins, are , likely to meet in the first or 'second round of the playoff~. instead of in the Stanley Cup finals. Well, anyway, keep a11 eye on Pittsburgh an<! Lemieux, for this is shaping u~ to be a memorable year in hockey.

<IIvltfllrbirnsis Dutchmen Beat Coast Guard- End Three Game Skid By Dagan La Corte Associate Sports Edit()r Its over! The thee _game slide that lowered Union's record to 3-3 is finally buried. The Dutchmen were able to beat Coast Guard 21-9 before a cold and wet home crowd of one Qlousand. After little success in the past three games, the Dutc.hmen decided to change arouiJd the lineup in ()rder to spark some offense. Coming off .an impressive :second half performa11ce .against the En_gineers of RPI, sophomore quarterback Scott Newton got his first career start.

Write for ~ports OCTOBER 29, 1992 • PAGE 24 0 Canada: Blue Jays Win First Series By Hal Poret Co-Sports Editor Waves of cheers swept through Canada late Saturday 11ight, as Blue Jay reliever Mike Timlin cleanly :fielded Otis Nixon's drag bant and threw him out at fil'st for the final out of the 1992 World Series. In winnin_g their first World Series, the Bl11e Jays also gave Canada its first baseball championship, which bas made for quite a historical moment for our n()rthern neighbors. After all, baseball is America's national past-time and there are only two representatives from Canada to threaten U.S. dominance over tile sport, Montreal and Toronto. The city of Toronto became one big party in the streets, as Canadim baseball fans celebrated the Blue Jay victory. Canadian sports fans will remember for years where they were when tbe Jays won the series, as our parents remember where they were when Kennedy was shot. The Blue Jays had taken a 3-1 lead in games going into Thursday night, and Jack Morris was on the mound looking to become tile first pitcher in Major League history to win a World Series game for three different teams (Detroit, Minnesota, Toronto). But Lonnie Smith knocked Morris out in the fifth inning with a grand-slam on route to a 7-2 Atlanta win, giving the Braves new hope to become one of the few teams to come back from a 3-1 deficit. In game 6, the Braves appeared to be making another miraculous comeback. much like they did to beat the Pirates in game 7 of the NLCS. Going into the bottom of the ninth inning, Blue Jay relievers had pitched 15 and one third scoreless innings wbile giving up only 3 hits. As tile Jays were leading 2-1 and only three outs from winning the World Series, Cito Gaston brought in Tom Henke to close the game. But Otis Nixon singled to score Jeff Blauser to tie the game at two and. send it into extra innings. After a scoreless tenth, the Jays put on a show in the top of the eleventh. With one out, Charlie Leibrandt hit Devon White and the gave 11p a single to Roberto Alomar. After Joe Carter, flew out to center for the second out, Dave Winfield . ~tepped to the plate. Winfield, who had only gone 4 for21 in the series, and :had never had an extra base hit in 42 world series at-bats, ripped a double down the left-field line, scoring White and Alomat to give Toronto a 4-2 lead. In the bottom of the eleventh, the Braves facing elimination rallied to get Jeff Blauser to third and pinch-runner John Smaltz to second with one out. Blauser scored on Brian Hunter's ground out to Joe Carter at first. and Smoltz moved to third. The Braves seemed poised to make another miracle comeback as Otis Nixon came to bat after tying the game in the ninth. But Nixon's drag bunt did not stay close enough to the base- line and Timlin made a nice play to throw him out and end · the game. For Winfield and Toronto it was pure joy. but for Atlanta it was the worst possible agony. C:harlie Leibrandt, w:ho gave up the vvinriing hit to Winfield will 11ever forget it. He also gave 11p the game-winning home run to Kirby Puckett in the bottom of the eleventh inning ()f game 6 last year, in which the Braves went on to lose.

With Atlanta leading 1-0 in the series and leading 4-3 in the ninth inning of game two, Reardon ,gave up a two-run homer to pinch hitter Ed Sprague to blow the game .. ·Reardon also threw away game three by allowing Candy Maldonado to single in the winning run on an 0-2 pitch in the bottom of the ninth. Other Braves like Brian Hunter, Jeff Blauser. or Rafael Belliard may have seen their last chance wiili the Braves go by, as they are likely candidates to go unprotected. and be picked by Colorado or Florida in the expansion draft. B11t for the whole team. it was the worst way to lose. Each Blue Jay win was by one run. In fact, the last seven World Series losses by the Braves were ·by one run. It hurts so much more for the Braves, but it was that much sweeter for Toronto and the rest of Canada who can rest easy with its first World Series under its belt.
