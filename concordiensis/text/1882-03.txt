There's a nook in the woods where the violets blow In the earliest days of Spring, When the hill-tops above are yet covered with snow, Anr1 the brooks are sv;;elled to the torrent's flow, And the 1 lirds but faintly sing. There's a cleft m the hill where the winds are still When the tempest is wild outside- While the storm bends the oak to its pitiless will, And rages and roars and crashe:.:; its fill, There's yet one place to hide. There's an airy he1ght near the dusty way When the sultry noon is nigh- Though the plain below, in the sun's fierce ray, Lies gasping for breath all the midsummer day, There the beE'ezes never die. I~ there shelter alone from the cold, and the storm, Arid the summer's stifling heat? From the ills that can bring the poor body to harm The nook, cleft or hill, like a friendly arm, Affords secure retreat. And too, methinks, from each ill of the soul, There is sorrte shelter given-- Some nook in whose bloom calm thoughts control, Some cleft by whose peace the sick heart is made whole, Some hill 'neath the balm of heaven. ZOR, '83. GEN. ARTHUR IN COLLEGE. BY DOW BEEKMAN. Irving says : \ It is the mystery . which envelops great men which gives them half their greatness.\ In the minds of the multitude he who has arisen to distinction seems divested of the common attributes of men. The private life of great n1en is concealed from our view; therefore we do not see their follies. We con- template them in scenes of success and triumph, and forget that they have their hours of relaxation. Their old age of victory astonishes us, and, not remembering their youth, we think they were born great. Every student is interested in the college life of the stateman who at- tained his first successes in the class room. He wonders if the san1e ability was shown in the discharge of college duties which is manifested in the n1anagement of the affairs of state. The youth of Gen. Arthur appeals iinn1ediately to the interest of every student of Union, for here he re- ceived his early training,and enjoyed the same advantages that are now given us. The same tnan who now holds the supren1e authority of the land,once a quiet, pensive lad roamed through the beautiful scenes and over the classical heights of \Old Union.\ Wishing to learn somethin!:, of the boyhood days of our President, the author wrote to the n1en1bers of the class of '48, requesting them to give some reminiscences of their honored classmate.

Thus in hetween the graduation of the class of' 48 and the present, and have left only indistinct remembrances of those by-gone days. However from their letters, which were very uni- form in their statements, -vve have been able to learn sotne of the char- acteristics of our Alumnus. Perhaps many of the .vie·\vs of their classn1ate are colored by his subsequent career, hut there was only one letter contra- dictory of the rest. Its author is a prominent western Democrat who has represented his party several tin1es in Congress. To show how far his college rerrJ etn- brances are distorted by his partisan prejudice we need but quote the be- connection with his classical training he received that pure moral culture which to a great extent protected him from the evil influence of col- lege, and has not disappeared in his later years. In appearance he was tall, well built, and erect. His eye was bright and full of the expression of char- acter. At the end of the Junior year Arthur had attained his full stature, and in recognition of his intellectual and physical development he was called \Old Chet.\ ()f this one of b is classmates says : '' He indeed \Vas entitled to the prefix both frotn I his appearance and his attaintnents- his being ' an old head on young ginning of his letter : \ I arn a shoulders.' \ Democrat, and endeavor to regulate my conduct by the teaching of my fathers. I toady to no one. I an1 not an admirer of that one who is uow known as the < Christian States- Ulan, '-that is, one 'vho regards swearing and drinking, an unpardon- able critne, and I ying and stealing not crimes but virtues.\ Arthur entered Union as a Soph- nlore and quickly in1bibf.d the class hatred of Frestm3.n, but did not allow his feelings to involve hin1 in any trouble. At his entrance he was eighteen years of age, having re- ceived his preparation under his father who \vas a n1inister and a n1an· Although Arthur was no \ hard student\ in the sense of long and laborious application to the college curriculum, he, nevertheless, main- tained a high stan din; in his class. It was the wonder of his classmates ' that \ Chet\ studied so little and recited so well. The solution \Vas found in his rare perceptive faculties which enabled hirn to grasp a prin- ciple in an instant. In this we may see the foreshadowing of the states- tnan and politician in \vhon1 quick- ness and shrewdness are the distin- guishing feature. In Greek and Latin, .l\rthur ex- celled, btlt in n1athen1atics he took

It is intere:?ting to note these peculiarities which at the time were lightly passed by, but un- conscious! y gave promise of future success. In bearing, Arthur was modest un- assuming :1.nd had none of that blus- tering spirit so co1nn1on among col- lege boys. While he engaged in everything connected with the col- lege, from his open, frank and gen- erous conduct he a\vakened no antagonistns, hence he was popular with all who knew him. In the many political contests \vhich arose from the size of his class, he took no part. He is not remembered as in any sense a \ wire-puller\ in college. Although he was a society man he disliked all bickering between sister societies, and recognized merit in whomsoever it existed, For every one he met he had a kind greeting and a quiet pleasant word. To his friends he was always true and loyal. There was a certain chivalric sense of honor in him that immediately inspired confidence and rega.rd. At one time the blame of a certain misdemeanor committed by some of his classmates was put upon him by the coliege authorities. He, instead of exposing his associates and prov- ing his innocence, said nothing, CJnd no pleasure. He recited mathe- matics to Professor Foster, who is still an1ong us, the teacher of future Presidents. It was in a recitation in n1e~hanics before that Professor that one of the boys called on to de- scribe a certain pendulum inadvert- ently called it \Capt. Kidd's\ pen- dulunl. The Professo1· did not ob- serve the mistake, and called on Arthur to draw a diagran1 of the pendulum on the board while the other man was continuing his ex;... planation. The Professor did not find a cause for the broad smiles of the class until turning around he beheld the drawing of a gallows, from \Vhich was suspended the body of the re- novvned pirate. Arthur had a genuine thirst ·for knowledge, and was ((apparently a scholar from his youth up.\ His in-· timate associates describe him as a \constant reader, and wishino- no 0 better companion than a book.\ What time was not devoted to his regular studies was bestowed upon general reading. Often for weeks he would do nothing but devour novels ; and, then, for an equally long ti1ne, he would carefully read history and classical essays. Scott was his favorite in fiction and Mac- auley in history. Few men of his class had a more accurate know ledge of ancient and modern literature than young Arthur. He possessed the rare ability to comprehend the entire b h f a k b . ll n s I s b s () h t t t l t t a i l t . J' r ) . 1 . 1

THE CONCORDIENSIS. bore the punishment as though it had been deserved. In college where there is so large a scope for showing a man's- character, he was never known to be wanting in matters of honor. He despised all meanness, insincerity and hypocrisy, and any manifestation of those qualities was sure to meet his scorn. Mr. George B. Anderson, his classmate, thus speaks of him: \Were every mem- ber of the class of'48 alive to-day I feel sure that the unanimous testimony of its more than an hundred men would be that \ no man in their class had a keener sense of honor in all the relations of college life than he who is now the constitutional head of fifty n1illions of people.\ Did not that chivalric manliness of the Arthur of college days presage the fearless honor and highminded- ness of the .l\rthur of the nation's hour of peril, who with the people mourned the loss of their chief, and turned the scorn of his enemies to applause? Those who have known Gen. Arthur in later years have always been impressed by his dignified gen- tlen1anly bearing. This, with his jollity and quiet humor ,also rendered him a pleasant companion in his youth. He had tbat discriminating insight into men ·and their character- istics which early taught him to adapt h in1self to th cir wishes~ and has since been of n1uch aid to hiln in the political field. He had an inordinate love for a joke, and was an \ inveterate pun- ster.\ His mind was very quick t() perceive the ludicrous in whatever form it appeared. An instance is given which can not better be related than in the words of Hon. William P. Chambers of New York: \Jack Foster lectured to us on Acoustics, and required the notes taken by the students to be submitted to him for correction. ln my note-book I had pasted on the in- side of the cover a n1ost grotesque print of a Chinese juggler performing on a musical ·instrument before a native audience. I had no idea that the print itself (which was more ()f less germane to the subject) could be objectionable to the Professor, bat it was Arthur who unknown to me had writtetl under the print ' Prof. Foster Lecturing on Sound,' that caused that just and able Professor to fail to give me ' max ' in that im- pDrtant study.\ In every college m!lny a man can- be found who possesses some of the characteristics which distinguished Arthur. No one will take note of the youth of to-day until he has be- come prominent, ·when thos,e who knew him in college will call to mind their y()ung ass.ociate and wonder that in the early life of. the student

THE CON:C'ORDIENSIS. they did not discern the pron1ises of coming greatness. From the college life ·of President Arthur we see that th:e destinguished man also had his youth· of profitless hours, his silent hopes and untold aspirations. Can it he that, as he sat in his col- lege room in the dim twilight, be mounted the airy car of reverie and sped .. away into th~ land of dreams until in his delighted fancy he saw I the vis.iDn of a nation ];>owing to hi1n as President? If he did, he is the ~rst U ni~n man whose aspirations in that direction have been fulfilled. JUNIOR ALOIBIADES AND THE SHADE .

CRITO. I , I At Princeton an unusually large · number of men are trying for posi- tions on the nine. An impression prevails there that their last year's tean1 was overtrained, consequently only the pitcher and catcher will be kept steadily at work this winter.- ·E%. worthy ones are very welcome to both student and citizens is shown by the large audiences that gen- erally assemble in the college chapel or church where a lecture is an- nounced. Would it not be a good idea for the students to make some arrangement by which we may have through the year a regular succes- sion of lectures on different topics of general interest? A committee could be appointed from each class to make the necessary arrangements for get- ting lecturers and providing a church or hall for them. 1\bout the hall there could scarcely be much trouble for doubtless the different congrega- tions would gladly throw open their churches in Sllch a good cause, if the expenses of fuel and gas were de- frayed by the students ; and by charging a moderate admission fee the latter could clear all expenses. Instead of a committee from each class, the seniors could always attend to the n1atter, and perhaps in this way could make enough to defray a part of their con1meucement expen- ses. The attempt is well worth be- ing n1ade.

Io6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. When it fell to our lot to make a chapel oration one Saturday morning, we were forcibly struck with the burlesqt~e appearance of the whole perforn1ance. As soon fessor. As· it is now, however, he does little more on Saturday morning than rehearse a second time before the Professor. c as ''Amen\ was pronounced, Pro- fessor~ and students made a rush for the door, leaving a few men scat- tered about in chapel before whom the orators spoke. It was supremely ridiculous to see men stand up before a lot of e1npty b~nches and endeavor But again the orators ought not to be the only ones to derive benefit from these exercises ; it is very in1- portant that every student should be present to get useful hints in coinpo- sition and delivery from the various speakers that each Saturday appear. By a critical examination of the ex- cellencies and defects of each man every other one. n1ay improve his style. And now why cannot a rule be n1ade either compelling every student to stay to the oratorical ex- ercises on Saturday morning, or else (and this would he much better) making these · exercises a regular recitation, to be held one hour each week, and to be attended by the whole college? Once more all the papers of the land are raising a great outcry about \college rowdyis-m.\ From nearly all the principal colleges come· rumors of turbulent outbreaks and to declaim as if they had the world for an audience. How now can a man be expected to devote much care to the preparation of an oration which he knows he will deliver un- der such circumstances ; and even if he does take pains with it on account. of the training he thus acquires, can he be sufficiently inspired when be comes to speak before such an audi- ence, to do justice to his speech or his powers of oratory ? We are aware that the object of chapel orations is to give a man not an opportunity to make a show, but to train himself. But then a necessary part of this training demands that the orator should have an audience sufficiently large to rouse in him some enthusi- asn1, and also to educate him in speaking before public assemblages. This is why a student is required to speak in chapel after having gone ' through the first part of his training in his ov1n room and before the Pro- sometimes brutral outrages at.nong the students. Some papers declare ' that \hazing\ and other barbarous practices of like nature an1ong stu- dents are increasing infrequency and violence. Now no one who has been connected with a college for three .or four years can think this for a mo- rr ' ' 0 s a: tl p t] rr a t1 a~ o: tl . SJ t] tc: p I a n tl CJ d c: tc b tl k d 0.

We are confident that \hazing cane rushes, and even the ordinary bitter conflicts between the Sophomore and Freshn1an classes are novv undergoing their death throes. This result is being accon1- plished both by ~he detern1ined action of the Faculties in regard to such affairs, and more especially by the growth of truer sentiments in the minds of the students about honor and courage. It is nonsense to say that while the rest of the world is advancing in civilization, the colleges are relapsing into barbarism, when we know that colleges are the cradles of civilization, and prepare the men that stan1p that of each age with its significant characteristics. In Union, especially, one may see that a revolution in. this respect is taking place, in fact is nearly com- pleted. The year '77-' 78 saw the last attempt at hazing. The Sophs. now confine their reception of newly arrived Fresh. to putting them on the table and making then1 set up cider ; and even this is being aban- doned by degree. Nearly every one was surprised when the cane rush came off this year, for all had come to believe such a thing would never be; and we rna y confident! y predict that this was the last scene of the kind old Union's walls wi11 ever lDok down on. T'he disgraceful custom of salting Freshmen in chapel was discontinued this year, and even the sound of the tin horn was seldon1 \heard in the land.'' ;\nd what is the result? Instead of a ceaseless succession of squabbles and br'Oils in which even upper-classmen fre- quently joined; instead of hitter taunts and recritninations continually disturbing the peace of even the closest friends; we have reached the period when Freshmen are placed on the level of n1en and not of dogs, and Sophon1ores have learned that true courage does not consist in bullying one ·who cannot resist. But although such progress has been made, yet there exists still in every college a remnant, and some- tin1es a large one, of the old evn ·i and it is this that is ever and anon cropping out to the disgust of all sensible people. ()f course much that we see in the papers is mere false report and exaggeration, but when there is so much sntoke there must be son1e fire ; and it would be well if this fire ·were stamped out entirely. In Union we need per- haps only one more step to complete the good revolution that is accom- plishing. If Eighty-two has any one thing to be proud of, it is that as Sophomores, they were courageous enough not to disturb the Freshmen during the cremation of Bourdon. \Ve say courageous enough, for we thin.k it required mueh more coura~e

Cannot the present Sophomore class imitate the good exan1ple set them? \Vhich, ·while it is acco1nplishing n1uch and is supplying a long felt need, yet certainly does not fill the place of a Historical Departn1ent in the College. Prof. Lawrence, who has charge of the small an1ount of History that we have at present, does all in ' his power to rnake the study pleasant and profitable and certainly ought to have a larger class and a better text book, and with thesf. t\vo acces- sions this Department cou'ld be easily made one of the most profit- able of our College course. ~@O~~ESPON DENGE.~> MEssRs.

Higson;\The Faculty,\ J. :E. Bacon ; \Otir Mashes,\ J. E. McEncroe, Jr. ; \ Frosh,\ A. W. 0 L I . . ,, McFarlane; '( ur ost .... uminari~s, H. G. Porcher ; '' The Class Motto,\ C. E. Franklin ; \ Our Dark Deed,\ R. B. McCown; \Our Modest Class- mates,\ H. Q. Pratt ; '' Late Ar- rivals,\ J. M. Lay; \Union Army,'' E. S. Earney ; \Castles in the Air,\ J. ]. Kemp. These were followed by songs, itnpromptu speeches and toasts, and at an early hour in the morning they arose from the table. The class song written for the occa- sion was by C. E. Franklin. The committee of arrangements consisted of G. F. Allison, C. B. Ten1pleton, E. S. Barney, J. S. Bishop, J. B. Hutchinson and G. F. Parsons. -· Every train on the eventful Tuesday, going east, carried a dele- gation of Juniors to the State capitoL Many desired to see the Legislature in session, and consequently spent the day in Albany. At 7:10 the last department left \ Old Dorp.\ .i\rriv- ing in Albany, they scattered,. to gather again in the Blue Parlor of the \i\!indsor. Eighty-three has not had an abundance of class suppers, so it was intended that this should be a men1orable day in their class history. Shortly before twelve the class seated itself at the table, and the fun began. The hill of fare was substan- tial and elegant, and none complained of hunger when through. After full . JUstice had been done to the viands and lVIr. Gilbert had entertained the class with some instrurnental pieces, lVIr. Sloan briefly and neat I y thanked the class for the honor done him by his election to the office of toast- master, and then called upon Mr. Addison to respond to the toast \Our Faculty.\ Mr. Addison paid them a glowing tribute, especially praising the friendly and parental relations they held with the students. In re- sponse to the toast \ Union's Alun1ni,\ Mr. Hamlin said that the deeds of Union's sons are topics of current history, and that she well deserves the title \ Mother of Presi- dents, Governors and Senators.\ \Our Alma Mater,\ said Mr. Gil- christ,\ welcomes all without distinc- tion, and therein lies the secret of success. Utzion is exemplified in practice, and not only in natne,\ '' The Cavalrymen of '8 3 \ was re- sponded to by Mr. Gulian Lansing, Mr. McClellan being absent on ac- count of sickness. The speaker drew a comparison between the cavalry- ·men of the army and the cavalrymen of the college. The funny speech of the evening was next delivered by

Several were called upon for ''im- promptus,\ and all acquitted them- selves worthily. These speeches, with n1any songs, : hid the retreat of the hours until 3:30 A. M., stared tbe boys in the face. Then closing ·with the class song, the class separated, \vith man v . .,/ pleasant memories, and vowing that next year they should meet again to spend an evening in mirth and song. The committee of arrangements was composed of Messrs. Hamlin, Adams, Lewis, Dent and Bridge. ternity. After the business rneeting, they adjourned to Anthony Hall to partake of a sun1ptuous banquet prepared by l\1r. Schnn1acher.

To THE CoNSISTORY OF THE FrRsT ~~ '. REFOH.MED CHURCH OF SCHE- NECTADY. · · · -Son1e months ago, the friends of the late Taylor Lewis, being desirous ' of commemorating hin1 by some sub- stantial and permanent metnorial in the church edifice in which he was long a worshi.pper, made application to the Consistory for permission to Many friends of the late 'faylor Lewis, LL.. D., desiring to signify their appreciation of his useful life and of his great services in behalf of sound learning and pure religion, have thought it fitting to procure a men1orial font inscribed in his honor. It has seemed proper to then1 that .do so. Precedents being against the erection of n1ural tablets, the pro- posed memorial took the form of a baptistnal font. The Rev. Denis Wortman, D. D., forn1er pastor of the First Reformed Church, Prof. Law- rence, and Judge Landon were appointed the comn1ittee in charge, Dr. Wortman acting as chairman. Most of the money necessary was subscribed in New York city. The font is of the finest Rutland light mottled blue n1arblc and stands just to the right of the central part of the pulpit, its tints blending well \Vith the polished marbles of the pul- pit. The font is a little over four feet high. It is in four parts, the die, the moulding, the shaft and the bowl. On the top of the.Jatter is an i_nscription in Hebrew from Job 19: ! this n1emorial should be like the character of the man in whose honor it is produced, simple 9 beautiful and substantial, and if it n1ay be so, that it be devoted to the uses of religion. They ask the church within whose walls he was so devout a \vorshipper~ and with \vhich he was so long con- nected to accept this font, and appro- priate it to its proper use. They hope that as often as it re- calls the name of the good and learned 1nan, it will also recall the suggestive fact, that great as vvas his learning, still greater was his faith.

In other words, talk sense.'' The son said that having struggled through his father's letter, he never should think hereafter of using a big word. -Ex. Nextsu1nn1er's I-Iarvard-Yale race promises to be unusually exciting. Both crews are vigorously training. Judging, 11 ho\vever,from the report of papers, r~ther more interest is being felt in the work at Harvard. The Yale papers are correspondingly dis- ' consolate.-Ex. rfhe Junior class at Amherst was a\varded a barrel of cider for •taking most prizes at the athletic gan1es.- 1 Ex. The Seniors at Columbia are the champions at foot ball, with the Sophomores second.-Ex. E:XGHANGES. -The Notre Da1ne Scholastic for Feb, 25th is up to its usual high standard. Many of our exchanges . seem inclined to criticise certain fea- tures of the Scholastic, for instance, the \ Art, Music and Literature\ column, and the \ Roll of Honor.\ But in our opinion the former is the n1ost interesting part of the paper. It is replete with pleasant little notices, and, despite what critics say, contains a great deal of n1atter that \ve might n1iss if we had to search for it in art journals. etc. Perhaps to the post-graduate reader such items are of greater interest when obtained from their fountain head, the larger 1nagazines, but for the under-gradu- ate, whose time is so taken up with text books that he does little general reading, vve think the college paper the proper place too btain them. As to the \ Roll of Honor,\ we \vill let the Scholastic speak for itself: \ 'The Roll of Honor is popular among the students here, and has a beneficial effect. It was bv its aid that Napoleon J ~ established such an adtnirable esprit de corps among lds soldiers ; and by its aid, to a great extent, is such ad- nlirable order and gentlemanly con- duct preserved among the 400 stu- dents now congregated here from all parts of the United States. If Prince- ton and Cornell and Harvard and Williarns and Toronto had a Roll of Honor, the disgraceful proceedings by which t\venty or thirty young n1en brought odium upon colleges of many hundreds might perhaps have been averted. \Ephraim\ is right; the Notre Dame Roll of Honor '' offers food for reflection to students of Protestant colleges,'' and \ Ephrai1n \ is so far ahead of his confreres.\ 'fhese remarks are strong and, we ilnagine, rather unsavory to some of our brethren, but it is their truth that hurts. There has undoubt- edly been 1nany disgraceful actions at the very colleges whose papers are severest on the Scholastic, and \Ve are bound to adtnire the nice way in which it turns the tables upon them. And after all why should not there be a Roll of Honor. Does it not arouse a generous emulation that rr1 ust be productive of good? And, by giving a present reward to scholar- ship and good conduct, does it not insure higher excellence in both,and

There is one point, however, in which we think the Sc/zolastic weak, the Editorials . Only a page and a half, sotnetimes less, to this i n1portant branch is en- tirely too little. \Ve think the Edi- torial department should be the largest in a paper, and such is the case with nine out of ten of our best exchanges. I The Exchange colu1nn contains this criticisn1 : \ 'The Unio;z Concordiensis contains a poem by \ Lor,\ '8 3, wh i:eh we consider remarkably good. With just a trifle more of sn1oothness in the rhythm one would he reminded of Edgar i\. Poe, by the \Veirdness of the fantasies which are expressed \' -We are very much pleased with the whole appearance of the Rutgers' Targu1n of February. I'he Literary column contains a fine article on \The Survival of the Fittest,\ in which the writer gives this expres- sion a broader application than as used by Darwin.

But one by one the false has vanished before the true. * ~!. -x- * * * ->.!. T'he history of humanity is the history of a never ending funeral-forever engaged in burying out of sight the false and the dead in science, in philosophy, and in religion.\ An editorial deplores the lack of interest on the part oft he students in the Athletic Association, boat club, literary societies, etc., loudly calls upon them to support college enterprizes for the good of their Alma Mater if not for their own, and censures those who \think that their connection with College consists entirely in attendance at three or four recitations daily\ ; and we think the Targum is quite right. in or suggested by the Un-ion poet's production.'' -Tizc Syracusan is a very good paper, but has several very weak points. 'Ihe. Literary colun1n is, we think too long, although that of the March issue, which \ve are now ex- arni ning, is filt-led with very i nt erest:ing matter ; its Personals are too few by far; and it lacks n1uch in not having an Exchange department. The Lit- erary column of this nurn her contaias an article entitled \ Eden, an Alle- gory,\ which we can scarcely believe is the production of an undergradu- ate, not only by the originality of its conceptions but by the strength of its rl.iction. There is also a pleasant letter from one of the boys now travel- ling about Athens. One or two of the editorials are good and strong, and the Local column is well filled, rnostly with ' dots.'
