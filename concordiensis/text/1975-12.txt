President -Bonner spoke of the introduction . of fraternities at Union as \a chance to shape the futuFe.\ Gro~vtb of Fraternities Dr. Millet gave an int~n~sting history of the evolution of the fraternity at ceHeges throughout the country. In 1825, Union put its name· on the map with the fouridi'ng of Kappa Alpha, the first college social fraternity. Many wondered what type of environment existed at Union in those days, which bred this innovation in the educational system. Dr. Millet attributes this event solely to coincidence. The young men of this . college and otllers needed !iome way in which to ease the pressures created by their studies; these primarily social organizations pro:vided the necessary outlet,. anq thus fraternities began. To understand the concept behind the Greek leHer fraternity, one must look hack into the philosophy of education in the 1800's. A college education was in those days restricted to only a selective group of young men. The 1raditional li-beral arts tradition was steeped in theology, phik>sophy. ana mythology. The elassics of ancient Greek and Latin ~>cholars fo1med the basis of this .education; its requirements were rigid, and the deman~s it A Change _in Education In the years after the Civil Wa.r, education itself saw some illlportant changes. Professional orientation became the majm trend of schooling, instead of the traditional .liberal arts curriculum.· Graduate study was. introduced, research became a ·function of th.e college and u,niversity, and overall enrollment increased. These changes brought similar changes in the social atmosphere of th.e educational enVironment. Reqpirements became less strict, and lloil-acaderrtic activities, such as organized athletics, began to become a part of college life. The post-World War H generation brought further changes in the educational world. The 50's and 60's saw a. new generation of students; they Were more idealistic, distrustful, and intellectually active, and thus shunned the sccTecy and excl us i v'i ty supported b·y fraternities at the college level. Today. the ~ocial life at'- the college community has become a part of the individual's college experience. Dr. John Millet sees the fraternity as the forerunner of such a social-ed1,1cational relationship. The fr.atel'nity has managed lttroughout the years to intertwine both these factors, while still emphHsizing the primary goal of the college experience to be an educational one. .. Continued on Page 6 \ 'Alternative Newspaper': Approved and Funded by JONATHAN SCHEER and MIKE AFFINlTO The Committee on Committees and t·he Audit Committee have approved and appropriated funds for a new student newspaper, to be called the Carnpus Voice. Mitch Mindlin, a member of the Committee on Committees, explained that body's action in approving the constitution of the Voice by stating that: \We acted in the belief that an alternative news,paper which pursues different avenues of news analysis and reporting than Concordy would be a worthwhile addition to the College Community.\ The newly elected editoFs of the Voice are Lee Rimsky, Matt Brief, R.B. Thau, Judy Dein, and Michael Kramer. The newspaper will be published twice monthly and is designed to .be \an alternative ou.tlet fer investigative newswriting as well as .a forum for student opinion.·· Issues brought up by l~;:tters Written to the paper will purportedly be explored in an investigative fashion. The Campus Voice is funded by studetU tax money and has been grante.d $3, I 00 to ~over production costs. ,. Elections Held _The editorial board was voted into power this past Monday. The elections were allegedly open to all members of the student community. Only eleven students attended the meeting, with five of those in attendance elected as editors. Publicity for the meeting was purportedly Widespread, but Concordiensis has learned that no notices were placed in fraternities, and that although notices were put in R.A. folders on the Monday before Thanksgiving recess, at least ten R.A.'s did not see the announcements until after elections had been held. On this point, one R.A. commented, \It doesn't seem logical to put something in our folders the day before vacation ·and have an election on the first day back.\ When asked if he had posted a notice on his floor announcing the date and time of the . meeting/ election, Lee Rimsky, editor-elect and R.A., repl'ied that he had not. Furthermore, most of the announcements placed in \strategic locations\ on campus made no mention of the fact that elections were to be held at the meeting. Questions Raised Valid questions concerning the election procedure and the hasty action by the Committee on Com- mittees in sanctioning the Voice have been raised in various quarters. Arnie Hiller, member -of the Audit Committee, has stated that \I think it is necessary that certain procedural guidelines be established within the framework of the student Constitution to prevent any further possible abuses of power by the Committee on Committees.\ If Things Go Awry Concordiensis has learned that in the case of fradulent elections, the Audit Committee has no authority to revoke funds. According to the wording of the student Constitution - authored by, among others, Matt Brief and Lee Rimsky - The Committee on Committees is the only body that has the pewer to question the legitimacy of that organization. Two members of the Committee on Committees, Matt Brief (chairman) and Lee Rimsky, are on the Editorial Board of the Voice. Concordiensis has been assured, however, that these two individuals will not be present if the Voice's election procedure is dmllenged and the editors are required to appear before that body. (There are three editors of the Voice not on the Committee on Committees.) If it is found that the elections held last Monday were not conducted in good faith, another organizational meeting will be held and new elections wi'll be required.

He then cited Presidential abuses in these _areas as ample evidence of the need · for Congressional action: \ ... Presiden-ts make war without going to Congress for a declaration of war, without going to Congress for any approval at all - all of this done in the name of the Cold War. \Presidents have increasingly ignored Congressional legislation appropriating money or directing for what purposes it shall he spent ... have impounded money so that the will of the Congress is frustrated ... \Every day, you read about the consequences of the expansion of the President's power over informatoil - information as to what the government is doing, informat·ion about illegal acts on the part of the government,. information about government agents plotting to murder heads of state in other countries.\ The senator said that although the War J>'owers Act and the Freedom of Information Act had helped curb the excesses of the Executive in two of these areas, only time will_ tell how significant these pieces of legislation really are. M uskie, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, devoted the rest of his formal address to a discussion of the attempts by Congress to regain the power of the purse.

While 'it. is· the ~ function of the Audit Committee to appropriate funds as needS' dictate, the establi~hl):'lent of ·Tfte· Campus Voice is being mi.dertak,en in a year when the co'minittee has found it necessary to cut the budgets of mo~.t stud~nt organizations. Concordiensis questions whet-her. the: investigative function of the Voice could not have been incorporated into the existing student newspaper,thereby saving student tax money, strengthening the student newspaper 1 and allowing for more cooperative investigative ventures. Still, whether or not the Voice may have been more efficiently included in present publications, this does not dispel the \smoke-filled room\ atmosphere surrounding the paper's creation. The function of the Voice is allegedly to exhibit the full range of student opinion. As one tax committee member stated. \There is a need for an alternative newspaper on this campus.\ In voting to pccept the Voice charter, Committee on Committees members accepted this st<';lted need for an alternative to Concordy while failing to consult next term's Concordy editors as to what their editorial policies might be. The supposed 'different' paper may not be very different at all. Furthermore, the almost complete lack of student 'tcnowledge of either the paper's establishment or its. recent \electoral meeting\ makes it easy to doubt the Voice's alleged concern for student interests. The question of conflict of interests also arises with regard to the Voice's passage through the Committee on Committees and its funding by the Audit Committee. Three of the five members of the Voice also sit on the Committee on Committees while one co-editor voted funding for the paper as an Audit Committee member. This virtual self- perpetuation of organizations and their fundings via a small group of individuals lends much credence to the charge that a \closed elite\ can manage the affairs and the pockets of students. Also. the method of appealing possible election discrepancies finds the credibility of the Voice's operation decided upon by the Committee on Committees, of which two of the editors are members. The student body has apparently little direct input into the decision-making process at all. I 11 a ~year in which the Audit Committee has -committed itself to a tight, controlled budget, the issue of whether an additional newspape; is a necessity should have been expose<i to fat greater scrutiny. Concordiensis would like to make it clear that this scrutiny should go beyond the involved individuals. Students should have rpore of a say in how their dollar is to be spent.

Editors, Concordiensis: Being among those denied tickets yesterday for the home hockey op.ener Friday night, we felt it important that it should be made public that a number of !,>tudents were left ticketless due to an inadequate' supply. The explanation for the insufficient supply: two hundred seats on the student side of the rink were reserved for a special group of donors to the arena. If it is to be said that Union's hockey program will benefit the school in the long run through exposure and alumni money, we will wholeheartedly agree and applaud the efforts. The special group of donors will probably help accomplish these goals. But never let it be said that the hockey program is for the students first and foremost. because yesterday the hockey program exposed its true colors and priorities. Sincerely, Lee Rimsky '76 R.B.

The Need for the Traditional Fraternity Re; Text of o.pening statement by Bill .Henson, Chi Psi '76~ en Friday, November 21st at the afternoon Panel Discussion of the National F~,:aternity Conference held at Union College The Need For the Traditional Fraternity I - am a college senior~ a fratemity brother since l was a freshman; :,t brother then hy choice and brother today hy choice. the reasons are basic. I have enjoyed my fraternity years, and 1 have grown because .of them. They not only nurtured in me a sense of -self~awareness and maturity, but demanded it. They sought leadership and soci!ll involvement. · They required charity. and personal responsibility. But they were not hoilow sacrifices endured needlessly. Far from it. These past three years have granted me countless unforgettable experiences. most of them shared with otbers. They have instilled a self-confidence and assurance that will serve me well in years to come.. Most significant, they have revealed to me the true m~aning of friendship and brotherhood.· 1, like many thou_sands ()f · college men across the nation, am .grateful for the chance extended to me as a fraternity brother to give, receive. to gtow, and to learn, .of myself and others. But as I approach graduation . and the number of my remaining days as an active brother wanes, there comes one nagging doubt, one growing concern that plagues me. If this concern is not dealt with, _then quife possibly within a very few years the (ulfillment and persomd rewards I, and many· others, have gained as fraternity .brothers will cease to exist. As we assemble .here to ponder the future of fraterni-ties, we must understand their past and their present so that future roads taken are the proper ones,. caref.ully chosen and followed. While I can not speak of the rich heritage of the Greek letter societies as ably as the other panelists, I can shed some light on the current status and value of fraternities to the college student of the mid- Seventies. The college student of the Seventies is the product of the Sixties - a child of Dallas and Watts, adolescent at My Lai and Kent State, and. young man -of Watergate. We have grown, .and continue to grow, in a turbulent age, a time of transition and doubt. Values and morals never qpestioned a generation ago, even ten years ago, ideals we were raised on, are today flaunted before us and then flagrantly defied and often destroyed. ln fact we ourselves are often the guilty ones, ,as a result of our youthful enthusiasm, lack of discretion and our own inner confusion. For ,-like the car thief who rationalizes bis act because the keys were in the ignition, we also often surrender to that mentality. But we are not only confronted by the car key but also the engine running, the top down and the door wide open. We look around us and what do we see? Out most trusted leaders are labeled common felons, sex and its debasement are incessantly hurled at us, virtue an ancient and scorned value. Our laws gain no respect from us. They are mocked daily as we children of the media idly sit by and watch. Or else we mock them ourselves. Our churches now surrender and accept pract-ices that twenty years ago would have brought excommunication. The sanctity of life itself is scored from one end of the globe to the other - h-om South~ast Asia to the legalized abortion clinics in our own home town. 'I do not question the right or wrong of these issues. I only seek for you to understand the affect, conseious or not, of .this social upheaval upon the I~ year old student entering college. Like young men of all ages once did, we are going through a period of great transition. No longer able to find shelter under the comforting blanket of high school blindness and immaturity, yet still vastly unaware. and unabie to cope with the infinite complexities of the modern adult world, we enter college seeking answers to many, many questions. But unlike the generations of college students that preceded us, we do not always possess t-he basic dogmatic values to support and guide us. Herein lies the vital importance of fraternities. For the college fraternity as it is presently structured can provide an answer to many of the inner dilemmas plaguing today's young men. And it does so based on a system and \set of values that have endured essentially intact for a century and a half. So when a young -man is inducted into a fraternity he knows pride and a sense of fulfillment. He has earned his position as a brother. For you do· not join a fraternity; you bid it. If accepted you go through an extended testing period, known as pledging~ The pledge term culminates in the rituals of initiation, the final and ultimate trial. At the conclusion of the final ceremony the pledge is a brother, sharing in bonds of affection with his fraternal kin, entering a life where much will be demanded but much more gained. But if this process were to change, as could happen, as is happening in some places, the secrecy cast aside, the selectivity and exclusivity discarded, then the pride in brotherhood would be irrevocably cheapened and the very essence of fraternity destroyed. The Greek fraternal system, instead of providing a basic purpose and fulfillment to the lives of many men, will simply and slowly breathe its last, as many other . human ideals and institutions have in recent years. In conclusion I would like to say that if fraternities, in order to survive, are forced to accept the radical changes that numerous people from many sources are urging upon them, they ~ill not survive.

I learned that fraternities are more than just drinking clubs, or . gr(lups of rowdy young men making noise until three in the morning. I learned that many fraternities were established, and still attempt, to maintain the original conce}?tS of brotherhood and care :~ .:.. for their fellow -members. But \ I also learned that frnternities were, and still are, exclusive male organizations with the power to accept; reject, labet, and hurt their fellow brothers and sisters of their college community. I learned th'at although fraternities often sponsor speakers and lecturers for their own members, they do not show this side of their world to the student body. They claim that such activities are organized solely for the. benefit of their brothers, yet cannot understand why the image they overwhelmingly project is one of drunken parties and beer- drinking camaraderie. One gentleman even ventured to say THE PARTY'S OVER. ends, the trouble begins. People who shouldn't be doing anything more active-than going to sleep are driving a car.

Gentlemen of Union College's fraternities: you have no reason to fear the infiltration of women or turkeys into your midst. l do not want to live with you, to contaminate your brotherhood, or deny your late night locker- room humor sessions. But you, as members of a college community, have a responsibility to your fellow students to show them this valuable side of your fraternal organizations. I am not convinced that only the fraternity can create the \bonds of affectiop\ one.of_your guest speakers acknowledged; I have seen many such bonds in every dormitory on the Union College campus. Visit the fourth floor of Richmond if you don't believe me. I have also seen groups of students, men and women alike, who are members of no fraternity or sorority, collect money for various charities and local drives. And I. have seen freshmen women come home from their first frat party, crying over the meat market they had thought would be a social gathering; I have seen freshmen males embarrassed and lost after being reJected by their colleagpes. after a half-hour cocktail party. • Your brotherhoods are yours to m~intain and perpetuate, whether · they are exclusive or' open. I understand that there are exceptions to these images; many men in fraternities at Union have developed friendships that will probably be maintained many years after their college days are over. But there are others of us who do not reap the benefits of this lifestyle, nor d·o we have the opportunity to even be considered for such a privilege. Gentlemen, open your eyes to your position as members of a college as well as members of a brotherhood. A scene from GREASE, currently the longest running show on Broadway.

Fraternity Confab Continued from Pag~ l Panel Talk The LF.C. symposium continued on Friday afternoort with a panel discussion, moderated by Provost William Enteman, whh topics concerning fraternities and their contribution to the modern college environment. Jack L. Anson, Executive Director of the National Interfraternity Conference, Dr. Walter Langsam, :President Emeritus of the University of Cincinatti, Dr. James Rhatigan, President of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, and William Henson, past President of Chi Psi at Union, were among the' spea·kets· · available for questions. Jack Anson spoke of the principles o:n which the fraternities of 1825 were founded, and the existellce and importance of fraternities today. Membership in fraternities saw a drop during the campus unrest of the 60's, due to difficult financial straits. But recent years have again seen the fraternity. become a popular lifestyle· for the. inale college student. Anson sees this as a positi~e sign that the goals and beliefs on which fraternities were based have not become obsolete in recent decades. Dr. Walter Langsam feels that fraternities have lived up to their standards of scholarship and brotherhood. He dealt with modern criticism of fraternities as in these organizations. Dr. James Rhatigan realized that in many cases, the individual will use his fraternal home and brothers as a refuge from the responsibility of establishing himself on a college campus. He also noted that many fraternities today have begun to sacrifice their ideals in order to establish their social reputations. There are those individuals who will exploit their fraternity membership as a way in which to further themselves politically later in life. Yet Dr. Rhatigan feels that it is up to the fraternity system to seek out such individuals, and to maintain the original purpose of the fraternity as an educational and social organization. William Hensen' was the only Union student to make a.formal presentation to the gathering. Bill - enjoys fraternity life; he feels that such organizations demand leadership, responsibility, and social awareness of their members. Bill, like Dr. Langsam, sees fraternity membership as ~owetlt~ng .tflat must be earned by the individual; it has a great deal to offer the modern male college student. ' Questio.ns directed toward the a question of individual fraternity members who have colored their house;s reputation, and not as the fault of the fraternities in general. - Langsam sees fraternity membership as a privilege, yet acknowledged the problem of the stigma attached to ma~y college men who are denied membership panel ranged from the causes calling for the creation of fraternities, in the 1800's, to the still-existing exclusion of women. Information on co-educational fraternities, on the clandestine beginnings and secretive practices of these organizations past and present, and on the value of American fraternity life today, made the panel discussion perhaps the most rewarding experience of the symposium for understanding the value and position of fraternities· in college life today.

McGovern Speaks The appearance of U.S. Senator George McGovern at :the Friday night banquet dinner attracted a large number uf students and non-fraternity people. Senater Fred Isabella of Schenectady was also present for McGovern's speech, and later formally greeted the Senator and He interjected a few words ori the · recent discovery of FBI and CIA underground ,practices as making him worider exactly what· our moral values as a nation and a superpower are today. McGovern spoke of our nation today as functioning under a po.st-Wa:tergate morality. Politicans today are held to higher standards; we are now more watchful and careful of our political candidates. the crowd. Senator McGovern rose to a standing ovation from the fraternity gathering. The Senator, not ha~ing been a frat man in his youth, very cleverly escaped the theme of the symposium. and moved int.o his own field - politics. McGovern prefaced .his speech with a few complimentary remarks on the stlldent today. Throughout his 1972 campaign. McGovern was impressed with the campuses he visited across th~ .. country. \I have never lost my faith in the y.ot,mg p.eople of this country,\ said the Senator. The rise of frat membership can be seen as a part of a larger phenomenon in young people today. The pragmatist, not the idealist, has become the more dominant person~lity on today's college campus. McGovern went on to speak of his own political experiences and beliefs; he claimed to have no regrets about his -presidential efforts; he laughed as he satd that he would rather be in Schenectady today than in San Clemente. He spoke of the horrors of the war in Indochina as creating new questions about our role in the world situation.

Brad Cagers Win Debut by HANK BERNSTEIN The Union College Varsity Basketball squad opened its 1975- t976 ·hoop season with a 63-48 win over Middlebury Monday night in Vermont. ·Coach · Bill Scanlon was obviously pleased with the outcome, but he was particularly enUilliliastic with the rebounding and defense. A'lthemgli.· tindets1t.ed.~''as is often the case irt many of the Garnet's games, the squad collected 37 rebounds against only 27 for their op.ponents. The front court led the way off the boards with AI Walker boxing out well, and Leroy Kelly and Joel Fischer grabbing 9 and 8 caroms, respectively. The defense played quite well as the low Middlebury point total indicates. Scanlon was not nearly as high on our offensive play. Statistically, Walker was high man contributing 15 points, with both Leroy and Fish ending in double figures as well. Hq:wever, Union shot an atypical 40% from the: Aoox, which is low compared to our usual 50% average. Much credit must be given to ·the Middl.ebury; de:&t~nse which exhibited an \exceptional match- up zone.\ This Panther zone effectively cui off the inside passes and truly hampered our offensive movement. The OtitclihiC'n\were forced to shoot more fr~m the outside and oftentimes became impatient, perhaps not hia~lng the best shot selection. In 'short, it made UCOLL realize the work it needs on offense. The UCOLL Hoopers meet a big and powerful Utica Club tonight (Wednesday, Dec. 3) in the fieldhouse at 8 o'clock. Utica \looks strong\ and again will boast a height advantage. Yet, the Garnet showed their ability to fight for rebounds in the Middlebury game. They will be ready for the home opener.
