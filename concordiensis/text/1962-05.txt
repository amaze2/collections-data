Last ·chahce There is one blot on. the Union College image wholly incompatible with the progressive intellectualism presently germinating on carhplls. This reactionary practice is \Hell Week.\ We fully realize that many houses depend upon the work accomplished by the pledges during this period, and for this reason we are not encouraging its complete aboli- tion, but its alteration, whereby two of the more deplorable and unnecessary practices might be ridded from this ritual: hazing and the disruption of classes the first week of the Fall semester. Hazing, as described by Mr. Steele last week, is prac- ticed in only a small, though conspicuous minority of Letters to the Editor Houses. There is little that can be done to prevent such di . l f th t r To the Editor .of Concordiensis: sadism, except rect socta pressure rom e more ma u e P.~rsopal.wise I goes for Prof. Houses on campus.

This will allow the Pr~sidents two weeks within which Department ·of 1\lusil'. to sound out their own Houses' opinion, before having to vote on the motion. Concordy will assist with a question- n,aire to be distributed amongst Frosh, Upperclassmen, Fac- ulty members, and the Administration. The results will be published in . plenty of time for the Presidents to better familiarize themselves with campus opinion. The IFC was complimented in this column several weeks ago for its honest desire and attempts to regain con- trol over its appointed domain. In order to do so it must prove more dynamic and flexible than it has in the past. Here is its opportunity to deal head on with an explosive issue, before tardiness or neglect again fore~s another group to settle this fraternity problem for them. The Lost Herd At last week's student body meeting, a total of two hundred students showed up to vote on the proposed Con- stitutional revisions and hear the speeches of the candidates for Student Body President. As a result, the revision was defeated due to an insufficient number of votes. The meeting was well publicized by the Student Coun- cil. Notices~ were placed around campus, and an in~ert was placed in the Concordy, announcing the time of the meet- ing and the text of the Constitutional revision. President Lavery further succeeded in convincing the Administration to shorten the 11 o'clock classes in order to give the student body a chance to ~ttend the meeting and still have time for lurlCh, The entire meeting was held in less than half an hour. Yet, in spite of all these efforts, less than one-quarter of the student body showed up. The students of Union College cannot blame the Stu- dent Council, the Administration, or- anyone else for their lack of interest. The familiar label of \apathetic\ rests solely on thetr own shoulders. It is hoped that next year when the Student Council again tries to get a vote on the revisions, the stud,ent body will respond with considerably more interest iti the working- of ~ th,eir school than they showed last week. \. . · Open.Letter To Henry Steele To the Editor of Concordiensis: I would like to direct the fol- lowing letter to the author of the \Open Letter to Parents\ which appeared in the April 27, 1!}.62, edition of Concordiensis: Dear Mr. Henry Steele: After reading- your \Open Let- ter to Parents\ appearing in the April 27, 1962, edition. of €on- cordiensis, I can only say that I was stunned and dismayed. Even if your accusations are valid I question your method of 'ap- proach. Your letter was almost as obscene as the practices you are condf'rr\nlng. T · ask you, Mr. Steele, if you were a parent, would you Want to read such :an article in your son's college pa- per? I doubt that you would, Mr. Steele, I doubt it very much. If such \subhuman\ tactics are being used by Fmternities at Un- ion during so called \Hell Week's \ doesn't it seem that we should at- tempt to alleviate thls situation through concerted . action of our own? Why must we throw this problem in the laps of our par- ents? Certainly they are not to blame. Your article amounts to little. more than a desperate plea for h'elp from the outside. Are we so immature that we cannot meet these problems ourselws? If so; I'm afraid we don't deserve to be here at Union. Even if it is necessary to in- form the parents of some of the unfortu!late \Hell Week\ practices that still haunt the Campus it certa~nly is not. ~ecessary ' ~o descnbe these sadistic and al'cha1c l'emnants of another :age in such viviq detail. Must we destroy the confidence our parents. ,place in us when they send us off to coi- lege, merely because a few social groups still insist on r~sorting to clandestine methods dudng the last we~k of Pledgeship?

Martin BuJ;llS '64. 428' State St: • Schen. FR. 4-0183 The recent Student Council elections demonstrated a tremendous shortcoming in the present electorial pro- cedure. Ballots were sent to each of the fraternities, and it was up to them to maintain their own polllng stations in the democratic tradition. It did not work. It is true that the number of votes cast surpassed the count of previous years when a central voting station was maintained, but were the addib.onai votes valid? We think not. Many of them were tampered with by the fraternities before being sent down to the elections committee. Often the question was asked \how did Alpha, Alpha, Alpha vote?\ and it wasn't uncommon for all the ballots from a. single house to come in with the exact same choices, written in the same color ink, and checked in the same exact style. This is an unfortunate occurrence that must be rectified by next y~ar. It is true that very often men in a house think and act as high a calibre as the perform- ance, one will find many indivi- d1lals on campus stating that the concert stank or at least wasn't very good. This feeling is approxi- mately proportional to their de- ficiency in -understanding what What reasons were given for the facts.\ To condemn the Third dislike of the concert by those on the basis of its stand on who didn't appreciate it?

4 Farrell ••• (Continued from Page 1) claimed that he didn't remember the incident. But professor How- ard Bell, a onetime student of Farrell's who- now shares the same office with him confessed to having heard the story 'way back when he was a student. Farrell stated that he was very happy to share his office with the math department's newest addi- tion. \Here y'(}u have the oldest and the youngest men in the de- partment and we get along fine.\ The new chairman recalled the time that he did gymnastic tricks for his final class of the after- noon. His favm·ite story tells of the time that he bet a nickel with his class that the proof he was working e>ut for them would come out in a certain way. He placed the nickel on the desk and pre>- ceeded to finish the proof which came out as he said it would. When the bell rang at the end of the class, Farrell leaned ove1· to get his nickel. It \Yas gone. But in its place was a shiny new dime! The distinguished professor is very much pleased with the spirit of the classes he's had here over the years. Uses Pick-up Truck His wife, Mabel :tvliller Farrell, has appeared in several Mounte- banks productions. His three sons are all Union men. Two have graduated, one becoming a Meth- odist minister and the other a mechanical engineer. His young- est son is a Junior and is major- ing in English. In keeping with his non con- formist character, Farrell comes to work in a pick-up truck every morning. That same truck is used to take him and his wife all over the country in the summertime. His hobbies include learning for- eign languages by himself (his current interest is Russian), and playing cello every Saturday night in an amateur string quar- tet. He picked up the instrument at the age of 45. Farrell did his graduate work at Harvard earning his Ph.D. in 1930.

As®•----------- grtmri~~~~~~~:JYb~eDi~rcntol?r~f To Beauttfy ampus Atheltics Wilford Ketz has been to be expected, faculty opin- ion concerning the general desirability and usefulness of this practice was consider- ably more adverse than stu- dent thought. Although two out of every three members of the teaching staff recommended the complete eradi- cation of \Hell Week,\ almost 90% of the students questioned expressed reluctance to abolish it. The students also rejected a con- version into a \Help Week\ while the faculty supported this change. The comments from b o t h groups generally reflected t~e sta- tistical evidence. Many of the pro- fessors who responded to the ques- tionnaire felt \Hell Week\ con~ flicted with studies, thus neces- sitating a change to a non-school week. As one phrased it, \if mov- ing it will cause a conflict with football or other activities, such a conflict is less serious than a conflict with academic work.

Spielman Is Victorious passed by the faculty council. The program represents a whole new approach to physical train- . ing at Union. It will be put into . practice this fall with the class . of 1966. Future students will now be required to take three years of physical training. Classes will be held twice a week for the full three years. They will be given in Monday-Wednesday and TUes- day-Thursday sequences. No Sat- urday gym classes will be held and Friday will be used as a day for making up missed classes. All missed gym classes must be made up in order for the student to meet the attendance requirements of . the course. Ketz stated that this would end the problem of in- firmary excuses. Excuses are no longer necessary for there will be 'no record of cuts. A student simply must attend gym a cer- tain number of times and absences due to colds will be made up in the F'J:iday makeup classes.

They are: Harold E. Way, Chairman of the Physics Department, W. Edgar Curtis, Chairman of the Music Depart- ment, Charles T. Male, Jr., Pro- fessor of Civil Engineering, Jer- main D. Porter, Professor of Chemistry, Benjamin P. Whit- aker, of Economics, and Sherwood Dean Fox, Professor of Sociology. Way will be working for the National Science Foundation as th~ !'r9gr:un Director of Ele~en­ tary and College Institutes Wl~h­ in the Institute Section, begm- ning in September. At present, he is uncertain of the el{act duties of this job, but knows that it will entail office work in Washington as well as visiting many college campuses throughout the country. How They Work During this summer, Way will tour many of the college cam- plises on ·his own, in order to see how other physics departments operate. Professor Alfred Theo- dore Goble will be acting Chair- man of the Physics Department during Way's absence. Curtis is leaving for Europe sometime in the middle of next October. He will be the guest conductor at many of the out- standing orchestras there. He in- tends to visit the Scandinavian countries and possibly Switzer- land and Great Britain, during . the tour. Leaving his wife- and tw() children here in .Schenectady, he will make the trip py himself. ·· · Cwtis elaims that it will \break my heart to be away from the college.\ His sabbatical is only for cme semester. Prior to his leaving he will devote much of his time to composing, which he cannot find thne for during the school year. The reason for his late depar- ture is the merger of the Albany SymiJhony Orchestra with the Tri-City Orchestra, which goes into effect this summer.

This does not include the courses in which large lecture sections replace one or more recitation periods, or,. on the other hand, individual senior project courses, seminars, or hon- ors work where they are offered. The median size of the recitation classes was calculated to be 19 students. On the whole, the class size of those courses offered in Divisions I and II are S(}mewhat smaller than those in Divisio.n III. Both in the Division of Humanities, and the Division of Social Sciences, there are 19 students to a recita- tion section. In the Division of Science, there are just under 25 men in the recitation section. There are 19 students per section in the Departmi:!nt ()f Engineer- ing. The labo.ratory sections are necessarily smaller in size.

The condition does improve in the upperclass years. However, there are 53 stu- dents crammed into one class in American · G()venunent, and 54 taking the Introduction to Eng- lish History. There are 50 stu- dents enrolled in the course on American Literat-ure. Meanwhile, there are 62 students in one sec- tion studying Organic Chemistry, while the group is divided into three laboratory sections . In History 10 and English 10, where large lecture sections were initiated this year, with these groups split into smaller recita- tion sections, the size of the Eng- lish averaged 27, while the single period of recitation in history was kent down to between 17 and 18. There is a single one hour lecture a week in English for the 111 stu- dents, while in history the three le:ture sections comprised nearly 81 students each. Other courses, in which lectures have already been initiated, include introduc- tory courses in philosophy, soci- ology, logic, general chemistry and freshman physics. 346 Trees To Be Major Part of New l.ook By Mike Berson The Campus and Garden Committee and the Board of Trustees realizing that build- ings alone do not make a campus have authorized the hiring of a firm of landscape architects to beautify the college. The undertaking of this project stems from the fact that the num- ber of trees on campus has de- clined steadily over the years. Elms, the predominant trees at Union, have been victim to the Dutch Elm Disease, a fungal dis- ease resulting in death, and have been removed in increasing num- bers. The landscape architects have already made a complete survey of the campus, its trees and their condition, and have proposed rec- ommendations for future plant- ing which will extend over the next ten years. They have sub- mitted to Dean Huntley detailed plans f()r the planting which will begin this spring and which will affect that pa1t of the college facing Seward· Place and extend- ing from Union Street to the rear of Richmond House. Improvement of the college's landscape is sched- uled for one-tenth of the campus each spring, to be completed in the proposed ten year period. Present plans call for the plant- ing of o'Ver three hundreq trees to add a rhythm and variation of colors, sizes, and shapes to this long, almost completely bare stretch of campus. The blueprints for the planting have been map- ped out and planned very careful- ly to achie'Ve effect. This spring's planting will also serve to screen off Seward Place as well . as the parking lots near West ·C'oUege and Richmond. · Scheduled to be planted any day now are 34 major shade .trees, 165 ornamental trees, including Jogwo()d, flowering cherries, and redbud, and 147 evergreen:;;, such as pines and spruce. The smallest tree will be six feet in height and the largest fifteen to eighteen feet. Any trees that fail to grow or bloom will be replaced by the architectural firm. The planting will take place first in the well-settled areas of the campus in which no building plans are scheduled. Plans for next spring are underway to l®d:- scape the main drive behind the Arministration Building and the area around the fraternities on Lenox Road. Improvement of the grounds around Schaeffer Library and the Field House will not take place for a· few years due to possible future construction programs.

In The Future. • • The following article was wdt- ten by an Alg·erian student now completing his second year here at Union College. He wrote it to ghe American students a greater insight into some of the major po- litical and social crises faced 'by the newly independent nations of Africa. It is written with special emphasis on the meaning of tht> Algerian i·evolution. By Ahmed B. Djelman The Algerian revolution for co- lonial liberation which started in 1954 must not be identified with any other revolutionary move- ment. Similarities can be found; however, judging the Algerian Revolution on these simi,Jarities is a basic misconception. The first phase of this revolu- tion, one success of the active campaign, is mainly due to the fact that it was backed up by the peasantry. In order to see the importance of this factor, we have to exam- ine the effect of the colonization on the Algerian society: After the colonization, we have the birth of two distinct classes among the natives. The first class embodies the majority of the Al- gerian population, namely the peasantry. This class was already existing as a free semi-coopera- tive entity. l.:nder colonization it became almost literally an en- slaved group since it had been deprived of its land and forced, in order to sm·vive, to work on that same land, but this time for the colon master. For this class, there was naturally no mid- The year has come to a close. To call it a year of dle between total submission to g reat accomplishments would be inaccurate. It was a year the colon or radical abolition of the system.

It is What has happened, and is hap- pening frequently has in the up to us to take full advantage of these gifts, and to use quasi-totality of the new inde- them wisely, pendent African nations is a trans- mutation of the classical Colonial- ism into a neo-colonialism. The l'o'lonial ruling class has only been replaced .by a native ruling class, and this ruling cl'ass draws its power ma.inly fmm the foreign companies which are sti:H domin- ating the whdle economy of their 1:espective countries. This ruling class is forming what has often been called a \pseuda-bourgeoisie.\ The term is well chosen, since this \ bourgeosie\ has nothing in com- mon with the nineteenth century European bourgeoisie which has played an important rule in the development of their countries. Our African bourgeoisie is not composed of financie1:s or indus- trialists; it plays no role in the developrnen t of the country since it never reinvests its benefits in productive secto1:s of the economy ·but, rather invests in the foreign companies present ,jn the country or in other foreign markets. The above factor is stimulating a widening gap between the rul- ing class and the masses. As a matter of fact, it has been esti- mated by the French economist Rene Dumont that in sub-Sahar- ian Africa a parliamentarian gains in six months what a peasant gains in thirty-six years of man- ual labor. Examples more con- crete than this are numerous: for example, the luxury of the capital of the Ivory Coast ( Abidjan) compared with the poverty of the countryside 1·eminds us of the Latin American decadent bour- geoisie. Also, in the Ivory Coast, a chain of passenger cars (Mer- cedes I think) is being built in- stead of tractors, trucks, or means of transportation more vital fur the national economy. H we try to interpret these factors, the picture obtained is disconcerting. Indeed we could say that up to now many newly independent Afl'ican countries have badly failed in what must have been thei,r primary objective unification of their country be- hind a rigorous reform program of decolonization and renewal. Consequences of this failure are: This \Bourgeois type of inde- pendence\ means to the masses that independence is not for them because they soon realize that their condition has not changed and is nut going to change, even though the government propaganda says the opposite. If this propaganda awakens a mo\·ement of .protest among the masses, their protest is quickly answered by severe government repressions. The masses in general are not, as many propose revolutiona1·y by nature; however, one could not deny their dynamics after a \po- litical liberation.\ Fol' the re- pressed Afl'ican masses this dy- namism does not turn into a revo- lutionary movement, but to an- other way of protest more easily open to them. That is, they di- rect their whole dynamism into reviving what is left of their tribalism, or by using another form of protest through reaction. This condition, if not immediately dealt with, could facilitate foreign interference, Communist or other- wise. I gave this picture in order to make it clem· that independence does not necessarily mean decol- onization and that real liberation has one prerequisite of decoloni- zation. Therefore, libemtion im- plies social, economiC\a-1 and cul- tural conversion from the old pat- tern into a new one taking into account the realities of the coun- try concerned. In other words this is what is called commonly Social Revolution after political Iibet·a- tion. With these factors in mind, let us go back to onr example of Al- geria. We have seen that the situation there is difficult; it is not the bourgeoisie that has brought suc- cessfully a liberation movement, but the peasantry. Without the revolutionary dynamism of the latter, the liberation movement would have collapsed very soon in the face of the French (and NATO) military power displayed in Algeria. However, this fact does not rule out the dangers that were \ideal- istically\ masked by a seven and a half year struggle. But the Al- gerian government has up to now been aware of the country's reali- ties and has realized the neces- sity to maintain that unifying dy- namism until the moment it achieves enough momentum to continue working by itself. l:Iow could this be achieved? How is the social revolution going to take plaee? The nationalism that is unifying the Algerian people is an energy that eould be easily lost into ir- rationalities if it is not imme- diately converted in· the mind of every Algedan into a political and social l'esponsibility and awal·eness. This implies a neces- By PhiH11 Cooper Hewitt It seems to me that the term~:o \honesty and integrity\ when ap- plied 'to the academic environ- ment, a,re usually used in refer- ence to the student and his ap- proach to the evaluation of his efforts. It is the problem of stu- dent cheating on examinations, term papers, and other grading mechanisms the only form of aca- demic dishonesty? I thi,nk not. In my mind theer are many forms of academic dishonesty, the least of which are applicable to stu- dents. Perhaps it may Le said that he form of dishonesty is of less importance than another. However, if one cheats oneself knowingly the cheater may be punished with some degree of ease. The punishment will surely fit the crime. The student may be academic- aHy dishonest by utilizing a meth- od which, will provide an inaccu- rate evaluation of his work. A glance .at someone's paper and plagiarism are simple examples. Of course, this is not an academ- ically honest approach to educa- tion. Yet the greatest harm is done to the ''cheater\ by the \cheater.\ A far more seriou,; form of academic dishonesty is done by the student who attend:; college without the detet·mination and curiosity required for the ser- ious pursuit of knowledge. He has cheated not only himself and those who attempt to assist him in the educational process but also the more serious student whose place he has taken. College is not a training ground for future em- ployment. It is a place in which an individual may study in the culllJJUilY uf others who seek the same end, that of gaining some quantity of .that elusive item called knowledge. No one knows all things. It is the task of the student to strive toward that enu with the full realization that the goal may never be reached. A student with this attitud.- does not cheat. He can only be aca- demically honest in every respect. Enough has been written about the academic honesty of the stu- dent. Now consider the same term in regard to the faculty of a college. A faculty member be- comes academically dishonest when he fails to realize that his formal academic training was merely art introduction m· pro- log-ue. HP must remain a student. He must not only be an able pro- fessor but he must maintain a eonstantly inquiring mind. There can be no respite from his studv of his own and related fields. Re- search and study are the tools of the ablP JJrofessor in his efforts to educate his students. A professor after all, is not a teacher. If hi~ only task were the imparting of information to the blotter-likE> sity to \politicize\ the masses, that is the education they will give to themselves by being or- ganized in one party that will ex- press their needs and efforts. The masses have to understand that everything depends on them, that the government is not there as their creator of \miracles.\ If a \miracle\ is wished, it is up to them to create it. By no means should the party be in the hands o~ the government, and thus, it Will appear as the transmitter of orde1·sr and the watching author- ity. . For this very reason, the party must be separated from the gov- ernment since the govemment it- self has to be centralized, while the party must be decentralizd to th extreme because, as I said be- (Continued on Page 6) 117 Mohawk Ave. SCOTIA, N.Y. 7< -t< 7< SHOW TIME 7:00- 9:00 minds· of eager stud·ents, his place might better be taken by teach- ing (and, examining machines ac- companied by a ·heavy dose of the literature. A professor exposes his students to ideas, ·concepts, thoughts. Of course, information is essential to· the development of these ideas. concepts and thoughts but a professor worthy of the title does more than merely pro- fess knowledge. He allows, even encow:ages, his students to dis- cuss, dissect and, if necessary, disagree with the thing he pro- fesses. A faculty member must be p1•epared to defend the ideas he professes. Only with .a free and inquidng mind, active in con- tinuing study and research can a faculty member maintain a Ievel of excelence. His students con- tribute to this by their very chal- lenge to him. Denial of this free- dom to the student or of this duty by or to the faculty rnernber must make him academically dis'honest. There is no honesty when there is no chaHenge o1· progress. Administrative Uishonesty Are administration and trustees exempt from the problem of aca- demic dishonesty? Again I do not belie>·e so. Generally speak- ing, it is the task of tmstees to provide a policy basis under which the college must operate. Then it i$ their duty to .find financial means to implement the policy they have established. Adminis- tration is the mechanism which makes it possible for the pdJ:iey of the trustees to be successfully completed without disrupting or disturbing the primary function of the faculty. Wh~n ,truslt'~S and· administration encourage and even insist that a faculty per- funn it:; main task of etlu~alion and enlightenment and provide them with their full cooperation then they are being academically honest. When any obstruction to the efforts of the faculty is given then there has been academic dis- honesty. If one fails to fulfill Iris stated aims then this is surely dishonesty. Of com·se, the subject of aca- demic honesty is more complex than I have indicated. My words are only a prologue and each of you may wish to disagree with my views. I welcome your dis- agreement and hope that by dis- cussion we can arrive at some rational conclusion. My own con- clu5ions are simple. If trustees (Stablish policy and provide a fi- nancial basis under which admin- istration can operate the organi- zation. a free climate .of progres- sive inquiry will be provided in which the faculty may profess concepts and ideas which may be examined and studied by students.

The column's intention is to promote the inter· est of bridge and specifically to impr.ove the games of those play- ers on campus. Generally a col- umn such as this, by a systematic approach, introduces the reader to the finer points of bridge. For example, a series of articles may explain an end play, an upper- cut, or a squeeze play. However, seeing that this is the first and last bridge column of this aca- demic year, I have decided to pre- sent an advanced hand concerned with the squeeze play. A squeeze play, roughly defined, is a device by which a declarer forces his opponents to strip their hands of valuable cards in order to pro- tect equally valuable cards. The declarer (person attempting to fulfill the contract) by virtue of his advantageous position of play- ing after his opponents, can save his winning tricks and cast off his losing ones. By this device con- tracts which appear to be doomed can often be made successfully. queen of clubs. In order to pro- tect his spade stopper, East must peel down to one heatt. When South leads the queen of spades, West is also being squeezed as he must also reduce his holdings to a single heart in order to pro- tect his jack of clubs. North then sees that West has kept his good club so North discards his losing club. Declarer then leads the eight of hearts from dummy and claims the remaining two heart tricl<s and successfully fulfills his slam contract. A suggestion for those bridge pl~tyers to impr()Ve their g-ames is to have a fifth player prepare hands from the paper and then have a foursome play and bid the hand as they normally would. After the hand is completed, the correct way of playing tl!e ha11d could be determined from the soiution in the paper. Players can benefit greatly from their own mistakes in this manner. 3.

The solution is that the declarer now has a marked double squeeze. He imme- diately cashes his other winning spade and gives East the. fourth diamond.

6 Gym • • • (Continued fi·om Page ·1) must demcmstl'ute that he has enough skills in those two sports so as to enable him to pmticipate in and enjoy them. The completion of the above parts of the program will make an individual eligible to under- take a large measure of .respons- ibility for his own physical fit- ness. At this stage the individual sets up his own prog1•am of .phys- ical fitness, in accord with the department's list of accepted ac- tivities. The student can lose this pl'ivileged status however, if he fails to pass the physical fitness test which is repeated at the be- ginning of each year. When a student ha:; reached the advanced stage he may elect an instructional course in the t·egular program for which he is qualified. A physically fit freshman who completes the elementary train- ing, and carry over sports, in the middle of his f1:eshman year, no longer has to uttend l'egular classes if he sets up his own pro- gram of physical fitness. Most likely, according to Ketz, most people will complete their ele- mentary phase in their SOJilhomore year. \Then after passmg the carry over sport requirements, they will be eligible for self phys- ical training.\ Plans are now to include a written exam in techniques as part of the elementary stage of the program. There will be a subjec- tive exam to determine whether an individual has fun in a sport, etc. Ketz stated that \if a boy completes our program in ten days, that's fine with us. Then he goes on self maintenance and only has to be able to pass the fitness tests at the beginning of his next two years.\ The gym and the field house will be left open more at night for the students use. Ketz ex- pressed the hope that the students would approach th program with a good attitude. Attitude will be taken in to account in deciding whether one passes or fails the course. , A new laundry system will be .' ·• put in to operation. The student · will have to supply his own sneak- . ·ers. The rest Of his equipment will be rented to him. When the equipment gets dirty, it may be exchanged for a new pair at no cost. A new uniform can be got- ten for every .gy-m period if de- sired. Eventually- Ketz hopes to do away with the present locker system in favor of a basket sys- tem whereby clothes will be kept in a basket and may be carried to the location of the activity. Nothing has been decided as to the fate of the class of 1965. They will have classes twice a week and will not have classes in their Junior year. Whether or not they will be incorpor!!ted into the program is not sure as yet. \No other school in the nation has quite the same program as this,\ said Ketz who decided on the program after touring the country's colleges, \and we cer- tainly hope it will be successful. The fact that 115 freshmen couldn't do 6 pushups must be corrected.\ \The key to the program is physical fitness,\ said Ketz. \We want each boy at Union to have at least minimal physical fitness. The tests we will give are the ones that President Kennedy has been talking about.\ Ketz felt that the program was a vast improvement over the present one. William R.
