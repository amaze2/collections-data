The Class of '60 expressed a greater need for the potential profits. The sophomores reported a treasury of less than $36 while bhe H.P.C. has over $600. The H.P.C. asserts that the money is being accumulated in order to present the college with a sub- stan tlal gift. It was argued that the Sopho- mores were in need of the money in order to finance their Junior Prom nex:t year. It was on this basis that the Sophomore bid took precedence.

Honors At many of Union's neighboring institutions, the oper- ation of an Honors program has proved both worthwhile and successfuL We intend here to raise the questioq of whether the installation of an Honors program at Union: might not advance our own academic cause. The belief of the Concordiensis is that the institution of Honors at Union would definitely be a step worth taking. At colleges and universities where the Honors system is now in effect, the purpose of the program is to permit students of high academic standing to carry out individual researches into individual fields of study. At Union, such individual study is not altogether unprovided for: advanced students may elect, if they choose, to take a \56\ course in those departments where such courses are offered. But while the Union student may, under the \56\ system, study in much the same way he would under an Honors system, the culmination of such study-the Honors degree-is never forthcoming. At Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore, and many other colleges which offer an Honors program, only those upper- class students who are candidates for Hon(}rs degrees may take advantage of Honors study. In other words, only students whose grades are sufficiently high to permit them to be graduated cum laude or better are encouraged to carry out individual researches. The Honors program at these schools thus serves two purposes. First, it provides, as Union in theory does, the facilities by which superior students may take advantage of Honors study to apply their own originality and re- sourcefulness to the learning process. But second as Union does not, it encourages these students to take' ad- vantages of Honors study by offering· them a substantial reward for their efforts, the Honors degree. At Union the facilities are present, but the reward is lacking. ' Perhaps it is unfortunate that such a reward seems to be necessary, but human nature being what it is, we feel that rewards serve a definite purpose. The words cum laude lettered on a graduation certificate cost the school next to nothing, but they indicate to the student that his labors have not gone unnoticed. The commence- ment of an Honors program at Union would therefore tmdoubtedly stimulate scholarship to a certain extent if only by virtue (}f the desirability of the Honors degre~ in the offing. Fliidoy, December 6. 1957 ·Search for Talent By Paul Fi'erutdlieih The Intelligence Race The Musi·cal Box By Lynn H. Ratner Sputniks I and II aroused the American people to the fact that the United States is a dark horse in two races with Russia. Th·e U. S. Is competing in a weapons race, concerned with missile and satellite development, and a sci- ence ·rac·e which is a move for more basic sci en tiflc research and a search for more people engaged in Scientific careers. A third race has been ·overlooked in the midst of the .Sputnik-Laika; hubbub. This third race transcends 'both the science a:nd weapons races in importance. It is the intelligence race. The intelligence race Is a phrase coined .by New York Post col- umnist Max Lerner in his article of Sunday, December i. As Lerner sees it, the intelligence race \is not concerned only with school buildings and teacher's salaries .... It Is concerned with how diligent we are in the search .for talent, how seri1lus we are about subsi- dizing it and pushing it as far ·as it will go up the educational lad- der, and how heroic we make the whole process of learning and teaching.\ * * * How can the American people enter the intelligence race? Max Lerner doesn't offer any essential proposals in this respect, but we suggest that he look toward Un- ion College. Union is very much in the running of the intelligence race mainly as a result of a num- ber of new policies and suggeE;- tions that have marked this school year. First of ·all, thirty-seven stu- dents were presented -with Eli- phalet Nott Awards by Union's chapters of Phi Beta Kapr>a and Sigma Xi. The Nott awards pro- vide a positive impetus to schol- arship at Union. J:n addition, six- teen members of the Class of 1961 were accorded Dean's List priv- ileges for the fimt semester on the basis of College Boa.rd scores and high school grades. The six- teen chosen for this experiment were prompted to take an extra course which would not ord-inarily be included in their four-year pro- gram. This plan, like the Nott awards, tends to stimulate an Intellectual :rebirth on the Union campus. Both innovations appear to encompass the heroics of edu- cation that Lerner refers to in If there are any .of you that are likewise.

Robert I. Foss of Teaneck, president of Zeta Beta Tau Fra- tez:nity, who proposed the award, , sa1d it would be restricted to resi- dents not a.ssoclated with Rut- · gers.

He had committed four fouls in the first ten min- utes but managed to get through the rest of the game without 'hav- ing a fifth called against him, Will~ms will field an improved team m an effort to upset the Garnet on Monday. With six re- turning lettermen and strong su,p- port from last year's Freshman team, the Ephmen should prove the toughest opponent to face the Dutchmen to date. T'he big ques- tion stili will be whether Cart- mill's hoo:pstet·s can overcome their lack of height by using a fast pressing defense and sharp outsid~ shooting. The big man in the Williams lineup is Jeff Morton who was the top Eph scorer during the 195U-57 season. He is a 6'5\ junior who should prove to be a worthy match for Max Steele in the cen- ter slot. He will also be the tCYP Eph rebounder in the fig'ht to control the ·boards which may prove the deciding factor in the game. The proballle Williams starting lineup will lbe Bill Hedeman and Phil Brown at guards, Pete Will- mott and Bob Parker in the for- w.ard slots, and Jeff Morton at center. I I RIZZIO'S RESTAURANT Oor.

A large sudden increase in charges would make the cost of an education prohibitive without the intri>ductioh of long term pay- ments. Although the Midland . Time Plan permits more agree- able tuition payments, there is no organization willing to arrange a mol'tgage-type plan at the present. Union is not alone in its di1 lemma, and federal and state authorities are considering legis- lation which would help out the privately endowed institution. Whatever the outcome of these considerations, it is clear that the attitude of the American publi.c with respect to college tuition payments will have to change in the near future and that action will have to be taken in time to. handle the rush of the 1960's.

Though there has never been any dire~t censorship of the Concordiensis, there have been requests to \let the story wait a few weeks\ Ol' months, or not to print it at all. No matter how good the intention behind the sup- pression is, censorship is the result. The role of a newspaper at Union, or anywhere else is to report news objectively. In doing this it works neither for nor against the College, but only for free and open inquiry and discussion. 'The newspaper should not be viewed as a \publicity sheet•• for the College. Of course it is certainly not the Concordiensis' purpose to discredit Union. The newspaper's function includes the mature presentation of all the facts needed for mature analyses of important situai;ions and this may cause occas- ional discomfort. Such is the nature of a free press. DSP Union: Circa 1877 Ed. Note: This is the first in a series of Union Worthies to be published during thg coming year. EUPHALET NOTT By Robert Galvin \From 1798 to 1814 I studied hard, often from twelve to four- teen hours a day. I slept little, often but four hours out of the twenty-four, and took but little exercise. My health failing, I have since the latter period, stud- ied less, taken more exeroise and slept more, though it is still diffi- cult f()r me to sleep when engaged in anything of interest. \I have always lived for the most part, on a milk or vegetable diet. I eat a little meat daily, but very little. I drink tea or coffee usually very weak, and I pl\efer black to green tea, I do not use distilled or fermented liquors at all, and though I have used to- So wrote Dr. Elipha:let Nott to a childhood friend late in Febru• ary, 1830, 'in his sixteenth year as president of Union College. A strong belief in total abstin- ence, devotion to duty, and love for his students made Eliphalet Nott one of the most colorful, as well as the most famous Union president. The· effect of Dr. Nett's fiery temperance lectures to the college community on lo.cal pubs has nevel\ been noted, but an excellent example of the intensity with which he dealt with tqe problem is n()ted .below in a letter written to an undergraduate about the middle of the last -century. \My Son: I have too great an interest in the young, especially those who have been under my cal\e to keep silent when I see, Life at Union was a gre-at deal more serene in 1877 when the (:oncordiensis was founded than it is today. Mr. Dow Beekman, '84, described student life in an article in the Concordy of Novem- ber 5, 1937. Parts of it are print- ed below: were active in securing friends to vote fol\ them. Each fraternity was anxious to have its pledges elected and combinations between different fraternities 'vere arrang- ed, although the neutrals held the balance of power. DR. ELIPHALET NOTT \In the period around 1877 lit- tle effort was made to acquaint incoming freshmen with each .oth- er as it is being done t()day. The first incentive for students to be- come acquainted with each other was the election of class officers. \Then an inventory had to be made of the qualifications an<l personality of the members of the class and the candidates for the variorrs officers naturall:y \All of the fraternities had rooms and headquarters but the major part of the social life con- sisted of meetings in the rooms of popular students. Around 1882 a fraternity named Theta Nu Ep- silon fol\med a chapter at Union which was then recognized as a hazing society. It had no head- quarters and its <:hief function consisted of holding a boisterous dinner in the fall term after In- Itiation.\ Job Interview List Interviews f.or the week of De- cember 16, 1957: Dec. 16--Rockbestos Products- EE, ME, IA.

Institute and Professor of Mechan- ical Engineering at the University of Michigan. He will assume the duties of Rensselaer's presidency March 1. Almost to the day of announ.c- ing the election of a new .pre,si- dent, Dr. Houston completed 14 years in the office of directing Institute affairs. He became ex- ecutive vice-president in Decem- ber, 1943, and in that position was senior officer of the college until he assumed the office of presi- dent a year later. He will l>e 67 next month. His resignation was accepted this afternoon by the Board of Trustees at the same meeting in which Dr. Folsom's election was voted. Dr. Houston has been elected to the newly created honorary posi- tion of chairman of the Board of Trustees. The announcements were n:1ade at the Institute's annual Trustees- Faculty Dinner, held Tuesday at the Troy Country Club and at- tended by several hundred of the faculty and most of the 23.,mem- ber Board of Trustees. Dr. Folsom, 50. has had a dis- tinguished 'Career as teacher. re- searcher and administrator. ·He has been head of Michigan's IDngi- neering Research Tnstitut!', w'hose research contracts tota-l about $12,500,000 for the past five,year.

In 1952 and 1953 he was also DirectO\r of California's Mechanical Engineer- ing Laboratories. Dr. Folsom re- ceived his Bachelor of Science de- gree in 1928 from the California Institute of Technology, and his Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy from the same school in 1929 and 1932, respectively. HPC ... By Bruce Hauptman This weekend the ,Mountebanks will offer three one act plays done in the arena style. These plays are Zone of Quiet, by Ring -Lard- ner, Pawns, by Percival Wilde, and Frank Thompson's Sham. George Buckbee and Bett Bur- kewitz consider proble,m.s · in Sham, one of the three arena. productions being performed by the Mountebanks tonight_ With th<> increasing -popularity of the arena style of play produc- tion, -both on campus and in some of New York's off-Broadway thea- ters, an examination of v.hat is meant by Arena or theater-in- the-round should be interesting. How does one go about pro- ducing a play in arena style, and how does this <liffer f-rom the more conventional form? Those are the two questions I shall try to answer. The .birth of any production lies in the producers choice of the play. After tthis is done, the pro- ducer picks his key men. These in- clude such fields as lighting, sound, costuming, properties, publicity, and so on down the line. Once this is done, these men proceed to prepare their various parts.

Amstuz, Chairman of the Col- lege's Development Council. It is the first major step, he said, in the program for substantially increasing the Institute's contri- -bution of able scientists and en- gineers in a time when the need for their services is becoming ever more critical. The Science Center, according to fundamental plans alveady ap- proved, will be an integrated group of four structures in the southeast corner of the campus with total cost to exceed $6,000,000.

After describing the contents of the pamphlet, the periodical makes this comment: \These interesting pamphlets about distinguished alumni and officers of the Col- lege, written by distinguished scholars, are an outgrowth of Union's sesquicentennial celebra- tion, a:.;td might well inspire other educational institutions to publish a similar series.\ It was understood that a deci- sion based on Lowen's findings would be made sometime in the ,spring.
