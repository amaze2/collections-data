Two motions introduced by Harry Benedict to revamp the campus communications system passed unanimously. A perman- ent Student Council committee was established to select and su- pervise a Grant-in-aid in charge of the Central Announcements Committee. Gerald Fincke was appQ.inted chairman of the Campus Com- municaticms Committee. It was announced that Hugh Lehman was selected as the Grant-in-aid to operate the Central Announce- ments Agency for the coming school year. One purpose of the committee is to perform the work of the Grant in case of his un- avoidable short term absence. Tippecanoe has become a tradi- tional get-together of selected fac- ulty members and student repre- sentatives to discuss matters of interest to the co1lege community. Michael Dinnocenzo, Chai-rman of the Student Council, pointed out that it is an excellent opportunity to find out about lCOliege policy. In preparing the agenda for the Tippecano Conference scheduled for May 29, various members of the Council reported on subjects to be discussed with members of the faculty and administratl:on.

The Admissions Department recently made known its redoubled efforts to stimulate wider geographic represen- tation at Union. Such a policy always plays a part in the dmfting of acceptance letters, l>ut it has probably played less of a p-art here than it has elsewhere. He began playing music that no (me had come to hear but that each Union-m1an tried to impress his date that he thought it was great music because she was act- ing as if she did and be didn't want her to think that he didn't appreciate music that she didn't, but neither of them knew it. H was truly a sight to behold: this handsome young man trying to keep one of the campus dogs· from ripping his pant-leg off, play Aufu!m!n Leaves, and .explain away an ElEl degree, all at .the same time. He was then handed some notes with requests written on them. These he quickly reduced to mathematical symbols with the aid of a slide rule. After the sym- bols and a qua:titer were fed into his piano-shaped: juke-box, the re- quests were heard. The motivation for this intensifyingofthedistribution policy may be the report of the Middle States Evaluation Committee, which singled out Union's narrow regional representation as one of its chief defects. But this defect, if localism is a defect, has undoubtedly been evident to the Admissions Office for a long time. .After he had. proved to the audience that he knew more than one piece, the pianist played the other song he knew. He took the popular standard I'm in the Mood for Love and with running com- mentary played it in the manner in which various composers ·of great fa.I!le would have it they had heard of it, which they hadn't, because it either wasn't written yet or else they died too S{){)n, The piani'st was heard to com- ment to his manager (!Sebastian somebody) that this Age of ·Elec- tronics w.e live in is wonderful and how easy it is to gi:ve a con~ cert w'hat with recordings, hi-fi, juke-boxeS, EE · degrees, and all. He then remarked (() his manager that he would have liked to play at least one ?Ong on the piano they had seP.n in the Chapel when they arrived that afternoon. His manager just shrugged and said, \I know, Roger; :but it was a Baldwin-.\ Narrow distribution is almost a tradition at Union. The student who hails from an area more than 150 miles from Schenectady, New York, is a rare bird, in fact, almost• an alien. One-fifth of the student body comes from the Tri-city area itself. Roughly one-third emanate from the .Metropolitan area. The problem is that acute. Obviously, the answer is broader geographical repre- sentation. But, if there is to be broader representation, applications from high school students of distant areas must appear. And if applications are to flow into the Union Admissions Office from Texas and North Dakota ' someone in those states must hear the word \Union\ as often as they hear the word \Amherst or at least almost as often. The problem here turns hack on itself, for who is to spread the fame of Union College but its students and graduates? And how many Union alumni are today tread- ing the wastes of North Dakota or plowing the plains of Kansas? Thus the entire question becomes one of publicity. The problem is a crusty one and will take some crusty individ- uals to see it through. It may mean the acceptance of less-qualified students from farther areas in hopes of even- tual cosmopolitanism. It might be noted that the walk back to Little Rock is considerably longer than the walk back to Gloversville. It is also considerably more expen- sive. JES For Your Information J.1'rida.y, Mas Ill.

The righthander pitched effec- · ti'vely in his first collegiate outing' last Saturday, going the distance : :for a '1.,5 victory over arch-foe RPI before a PrO>Jn Weekend cr.owd. The win snawed Un:ion's two-game losing streak. La.wrence Pleased The Dutchmen also defeated· another tri-city rival, Siena Col- lege, on Wednesclay, May 9, in a -slam-bang affair.

Van de Car assumed the men- taring position last Friday and coaehP<l. the team against New HampshiPe the same day. He will handle the team for the balance of the current season. Due to the athletic depar'tment policy of hav- ing all coaching assignments han- dled by members of the depart- ment, it is doubtful that Van de Car Will continue in that capacity next year.

Quality Control is responsible for the performance of IBM's vast array of business ma- chines-from si:rnple sorters and punches to the ''electronic brains.''

Nick has been instrumental in encouraging many college physics majors to come to IBM. \I find they're interested in questions like these,\ he says: \How would you go about determining the 'life' of elec- trons in transition from the valence to the conduction band?\ Or, in the manufacture of magnetic inks, \How can the grain size of the iron content be controlled •.• or its viscosity regu- lated over wide temperature ranges?

The Presidential View The r:mk list of the colleges and universities in the United States is always a dangerous thing to publish, be- cause it is sure to arouse a great deal of controversy. Schools which are left off the list or which feel that the;-.' are not high enough on the list are inclined to protest that the jury v..as prejudiced, or that the criteria for sp]ertion were inadequate, or that the best colleges always hide their lights under bushels. It is undoubtedly true that the quality of a college changes from year to year, one might almost say from day to day. It is sometimes more impor- tant to know the name of the faculty member unC!er whom a student did his major work than it is to know the insti- tution from which he received his degree. Also it is 0b- vious that Union Colleg-e in 19fi7 has quite a different fac- ulty from what it had in 19-16 or what it wHJ have in 196-1. It is pleasant to record that the Chicago Tribune on Easter Sunday, 1957, listed Union as one of the ten out- standing men's colleges in the United States. Althoug-h we must confess that we were surprised at some of the omis- sions, we also were pleased to ·note that we were in good company. Much more important, because of its authoritative nature, was the evaluation of Union Colleg-e and Universitv by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Second- ary Schools in the Spring of 1907. You \viJireca!l th<1t we spent an entire year preparing a report for the l\Iiddle States in the form of a self study. This was follo\ved up by a t~ree day visit of an eleven man committee in J\Iarch, and thetr report to the Commission on Institutions of II igher Education. We are all gratified that the Commission has written to us as follows: \The Commission's decision was to reaffirm the ac- creditation of UnioR College and Union Universitv. The Commission is deeply appreciative of the opportt-initv it has had to examine the aims and affairs of an outstanrling- institution a:t;d wishes to commend you, your colleagues and your vanous boards of governance for settin()' and re- vealing standards and procedures for distinO'uisl;ed work thereby performing a service to the whole ~ommunitv of higher education.\ ' Accompanying this letter was a forty-two page analy- sis by a visiting committee, which will serve as the aO'enda for our Faculty Retreat at Lake George next Sept;mber 15th, 16th, and 17th. Out of these discussions \\'ill un- doubtedly come many ideas which we hope will improve the program of the College in 1957-5 8. Another important development of this past year was the bequest from Mrs. Marjorie Nott l\Iorawetz of approxi- mately $300,000 to endow the maintenance of our grounds and gardens. The income from this should enable us to keep the campus in beautiful condition. The continued growth of our endowment funds is a fine guarantee that the College will continue to rank among the best American colleges for men for years in the future. To the seniors we wish a very happy Commencement. To the rest of you we hope that we will be meeting again in September. CARTER DAVIDSON, President \We're de-emp<ha.sizing te.nnis!\ Tribune Reactions By Bruce F. Boklan We find that the Chicago Tl•ib- une is not the only newspaper capable of rating colleges (iCf. Concordiensis, Apdl 26), although it bas set the wheels into motion among many college newspapers. Actually, no college daily has taken it upon itself to formulate a full rating comparable to the Tribune, but many have sought to make revisions in their own particular category, apparently satisfied with tbe rest of the lists. * * _,_ The MoWlt Hol.yoke News, in a t·ecent article, quotes a headline from the Amherst Student, \Holy- oke over Smith.\ We don't quite see why Amherst's opinion should mean so much to the young ladies, but then again, who are we to question ivy standards. Our own opinion stands reserved. The Holyoke paper also took pains to clarify what they consider an error, They seem to feel that they were rated fifth and Welles- ley sixth -among women's colleges, and not the reverse as reported in many newspapers. Our own records indicate that Wellesley was awarded the fifth position immediately followed by Mount Holyoke. Sorry, Miss Hollyhock. * * -» The Bowdoin Orien·t, while not taking issue directly with the findings of the TJ.·ibune, indicated that there was a possibility of favoritism shown in compiling the facts. Bowdoin, whi.ch was placed seventh among men's col- leges, seemed to feel that those schools which had the greatest representation on the committee in charge placed highest on the lists or at least higher than they- should have pltwed. We find that their correlation is accurate but wish to point out that Union was not ·represented on the co-mmittee. We were sixth. * * * One of the satisfied schools was Wesleyan, which achieved save one, that one being the one which placed Smith sevent~ among women's .colleges and last among the Seven Sisters. This was the only case we have noted in which the President of the school took a public stand qn the results of the Tlibune's poll. Dr. Wright pointed to the fact that \in judging the universities, the .outstanding departments of each were compiled. The most highly rated institutions were those with the most disinguished departments. This criterion does not appear to have been used in the rating of women~s colleges. Had it been followed, Smith would have been at the top of the list.\ Feeling in Northampton main- tains that the size of Smith con- tributed greatly to her low posi- tion on the rating. The Sophian counters this with the claim to equality in the all important teacher-student ratio. In an editorial a week later criticism was made of the meth- ods of the poll and the lack of adequate representation. The edi- tor calls attention to the presence of the delegate from Bryn Mawr <number one) as the \only person on the list associated with a women's college ... \ * * * In all fairness we feel we .must comment on the article which ap- peared in the Union <College Con- cordiensis of .April 26. No com- ment was made here in appraisal of the validity of the ratings. No comment was made as to who should have or should not have been placed in any one position. We merely listed the schools as they stood and the educators who put them there. We of Union are completely satisfied and see no need for any sort of reappraisal. ----------------------------- fourth position among men's col- Requiescant, Mr. Martin For Your Info·rmation Saturday, May 18.

Why; he has insulted their intelligence hy expecting them to do so. 'Mr. Martin is obviously a social- ist and is trying to undermine the American way of life. Piano- shaped juke-box indeed!

Why~ it is perfectly insane. The continuity is awful, the wording is confusing, the content obscure, and everyone knows that contrac- tions just have no place in formal English. !Martin is obviously a sado-masochist who will go on to become an iconoclast if not ca:re- fuily- watched.
