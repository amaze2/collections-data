At the present time approximate- somewhere in the neighbor1iood of The weekend over, our old Early this semester the announcement regarding the temporary abolition of final examinations was made. Dr. Davidson's re- port was greeted with loud rejoicing and the general feeling that the college had taken a long step forward in the field of progressive education. Now, the reaction has set in. At first, the knowledge that there would be no final exams for this semester at least left everyone with a feeling of relief. No longer would we have to bum the midnight oils the last week before examination week began. No longer would we have to \sweat out\ the customary posting of marks in the various buildings. No longer, or at least, not this term. But, alt·ead~' the realizati0n has c1·ept into the hearts of many that the new system is, if anything, more exacting· than was the older. For the first weeks, there were relatively few manifestations of the things in store. Hints were dropped by some professo1·s to the students and by some students fl·om their minds that a day of reckoning-namely hour exams-might be expected soon. Then, came the dawn. Shortly over two weeks ago, the deluge began as class after class featured quizzes. Man after man began to hold his head as he l'ealized the task in front of him. There seemed to be no relief in view .. Why all this perturbation? Why should we be bothered about such inconsequential matters as hou·r exams? Never before· had the prospect caused such worry. The crux of the matter lies in the fact that Union students now have considerably more to do than they had at any tlrne previously. Under the new method of grades, each hour exam counts far more than it has ever counted before. There are far more exams than there ever were before. That in itself would not be too bad. But, the system is not uniform. As things now stand. there is hardly a man in college who doesn't have at least one exam a week. Some students find themselves with courses which call for term papers, others have lengthy lab reports, almost every course has regular assignments. Then, on top of the already heavy burden is piled the responsibility of hom exams. The situation calls for alleviation. We predict that the recently organized Board of l\Ianagers, when it searches the files and interviews students to account for the present lapse in student interest in affairs extra-curricular, will find that the vast ma- jority of the interviewees will claim to have too much work to devote time to other things. With constantly recuning examina- tions, the individual must remain constantly on his toes to retain satisfactory grades. Our suggestion is, we feel, simple. In the past, thel'e were hour exams in most classes. These were, however, held at far greater intervals and usually in concert with those of the other classes-a sort of mid-semester examination period. With the abolition of fi.nals, professors naturally feel that it is necessa1·y to hold more freq.uent Teviews. Can not these reviews, admittedly necessary, be held at certain set periods and then after the fashion of finals; come at approximately the same time. Anticipating the comments which are sure to come let us say to those who come up with the statement that regular spacing of tests will cause a series of spurts and let- downs that the average cog-wheel has regu- lar cogs set at regular intervals and IT seems to move evenly and satisfactorily enough. ly 800,000 veterans are in the col- $544, These figures are based upon . friends, the alumni will, a-fter many lege and universities of the coun- the interpretation of .a norma:!

Much interest is naturally evi- denced by the veterans in the pos- sibility of their receiving a bonus. Normally the funds for a bonus are raised by a bond issue which must be approved by the voters of the State. During Septem·ber the voters of the State of Maine disapproved on a state-wide referendum a bonus of $150 for veterans of World War II by a decisive 2 to 1 vote with 83 per cent of the electorate going to the polls. This may be a bit of evidence of what is in store for the bonus proposals in New York, Illi- nois, Michigan and Rhode Island in November. The legislatures in the above five states approved the bond issue but the voters have the final word. In the political field it is worthy of notice that nearly 200 World Warii veterans have been nomi- nated for Congress. The Demo- crates have about 50 per cent more candidates in the field than the Republicans. Apparently the question of the ability of a veteran to apply for educational benefits under 346 while on terminal leave has not been set- tled by the Veterans Administra- tion on a n:<tional basis. In our region the Veterans Administration has been very willing to accept in- terim orders placing an officer or enlisted man on final leave as evi- dence for the granting of educa- tional eligibility rights. Some re- gions refuse to issue the certificate till the final discharge or separation goes. into effect.

On three completed passes the Feegees drove to within 12 yards off the goal, then dropped two passes giving the ball to the Delta Phi's. On the second down, Young intercepted a Delta Phi pass and carried it to the three yard line, One pass was ·batted down, hut the second try was good for six points. The kick went between the posts to make it 7-0. From that point on it was Phi Gam's game, although neither team scored again. The Phi Gam's almost scored when the ball was bobbled on the goal line, and it looked like about half of each team touche<;} it before it finally fell, in- complete.

Steigert and Byron tied for fifth place with a time of :33:35. The remaining slots were taken by Brooklyn Poly men who followed the Garnet's six entrants. The race was held at Van Cort- landt Park in New York City. The times were poor and gave no indi- cation of the excellent running the Union hill-and-dalers made, The course was new and completely un- known to the men. In addition cloudy weather and occasional showers made the track very sloppy and slow, Hopes Running High Indications are Union will make a good showing against Williams. The visitors will be slight favorites due to the relative performances against RPI.

He has been widely acclaimed as an expert on our South American neighbors and their activities. Through close contact with many of the political leaders and his knowledge of intrigues, he is well qualified to answer many of the present questions concerning Latin Am·erica. .:.1r. Josephs will discu8s our pres· ent policy in dealing with our \Good Neighbors\ and point out some of their faults. He has state, \The democratic elements down there are losing heart and are fearful of another shaping up of the same things which brought on World War II.· He also points out that our present course of action is leading the people again to mistrust us and the same old fears of a domineering giant to the north are returning. These Latin American countries, in the opinion of ~1r. oJsephs, .are mo::;t important to .us. They are the nations we are closest to and that we must co-operate with in ot·der to get along. He fears that many of the forces of fascism are planning to lay low in South Amer- ICa for the time being and gain strength there. His continuous at- taclts against such elements as these account for his popularity with the democratic forces in the lands to the south of us. The present situation in both .Mexico and Argentine will be dis- cussed by .:.v.Ir. Josephs. He will attempt to answer such questions as \liave the Nazis been stopped in the other Americas?\ \What do Britain and Russia really want in Latin America'!\ \Who are the men to watch in the Southern Hemisphere?\ A native of Philadelphia and a graduate of the University of .Pennsylvania, Josephs became a reporter for the Philadelphia l£ve- ning Bulletin and was sent to South America by that paper in 1940. While he was there he lived in most of the countries, marrying a girl from :Buenos Aires. He also wrote for the New York Times, many leading magazineli, and broadcast for CBS and NBC.

Beginning Thm sday evening and continuing. through Sunday night, hundred of Old Grads and their friends and fa.r.ilies poured onto the campus. Hardly a class Friday and Saturday was bereft of the presence of at least one oldst~r. These men took intense delight m sitting in their old seats in their old classrooms listening to the same old lectures from (in many case) the same old lecturers. Fraternity h0uses weer crowded to overflowing. Walks and paths we1:e fiHed to capacity plus. Alexan- der Field, during the Williams- Union football game rocked with the slightly-hoarse voices of alumni digging back in their memories for the barely remembered cheers and songs. Hale House had its feeding capa- city strained to the utmost. Long lines wove in and out as hungry visitors vied with hungry Union students for the viands which were provided on the holiday menu. In the evening, particularly Sat- urday evening, soft lights about the campus gleamed down on tight groups· as the alumni went about \visiting\ and serenading each other with the ·baUads of their un- dergraduate days. The noise w::s terrific, Undergraduates were, 1n many cases, put to shame by the whiskey-tenors and beer-baritones of their elders. Fraternity houses, college buildings, available open spaces-all were thvonged with ex- uberant alumni, To keep the records straight, Union athletic teams emerged vic- torious on all fronts as the football team downed a stubborn Williams eleven on Alexander Field (details on page five) and the cross-country team conquered an equally stub- born Williams squad over Unioh's 4.7 mile course (details like\lfise on page five). The spectators were treated to a new sight as the cheerleading squad appeared with two young goats labeled Union. There were many ~'omments that perhaps Wil- liams would get Union's goat but, to everyone's satisfaction, nothing untoward happened save that one of the Union banners adorning the goats disappeared under the eyes of the crowd during the post-game singing of the Alma Mater. Comments were heard on all points that the college hadn't changed in umpteen years. Other, and equally prominent comments gave the impression that the alum- ni thought things weren't at all the same as they used to be. Bu, com- ments not to the contrary, the week-end seemed enjoyable by all. This was the first homecoming week-end in over four years. The college and the alumni did every- thing in their power to make it the most successful in Union's history. It was! Swimming Maybe!

Jack Tway was elected Chairman of the group, and Don Treanor will be Secretary. The purpose of the Board is to assist in the coordination of stu- dent activities, and to help create interest in student activities in general. The organization wiii help proomte the welfare of the various student .groups on the campus, and will act as a sounding board to aid in solving problems of these groups individually and as a whole. The Board will be represented on the Student Council by three members, and on the College Committee on Student Affairs and :Relations by one member. The membership of the organiza- tion will be ~omposed of one repre- sentative of each tax-supported activity on the campus, chosen by the individua;l activities, and one representative from any other ap- proved student activities, chosen by the Board. The Coot•dinator of Student Actviities, Mr. Wilford H. Ketz, and the chairman of the Student Tax Committee, will both serve as Ex-Off.icio members of the Board. The group is now engaged in a study of all extra-curricular· stu- dent activities on the campus to see which students are actively participating in the various stud~nt groups. Very shortly they are gomg to segregate the names of all, stu- dents who professed an interest in some activity (on their student activity ~ards), but who have not followed their original plans through. By contacting each of these men personally they hope to get more men actively engaged in extra-curricular pursuits. ---0•--- NOTICE PIDLOMATHEANS The fourth meeting of the Philo- matheans is to be held this coming Monday evening at 7:30 in the Bailey Hall reading room.

It would not preju- dice the Republican nomination in 1948. And it would achieve the same objective as the Fulbright proposal; the immediate assign- ment of clear-cut responsibility for direction of the Government to the majority party in Congress. ''Responsible spokesmen throughout country agree election results confront na- tion with constitutional crisis lasting to 1949 jeopardizing na tiona! stability and effec- tiveness at home and abroad. Urge necessity of immediate actiem calling upon Republican party leadership for nomina- tion of a cabinet by whose policy decisions you as Presi- dent will be bound.\ * \ By their action on November 5, the American voters have given overwhelming support to the Re- publican Party. The voters have declared their preference for the national leadership for which the Republican Party stood. The voters did not intend their decision to add to the national confusion. The nation cannot bear the \accent on politics\ which everyone agrees would prevail until the election in 1948. With the execut!ve and legis- lative branches in control of dif- ferent parties, we are faced with the two-year prospect of the same political paralysis of 1911-13, 1919- 21, and 1931-35. The decision of the voters insist that the country cannot wait for the elections in 1948 for a change in national lead- ership and national policy. Respon- sible spokesmen throughout the country are saying that the de- cision of 1946 will not become effective until 1949 because of t·he conflict between the executive and the legislative branches which will dominate until the decision of 1948 It is generally agreed that this will endanger the effectiveness of our domestic policies and hence the effectiveness and authority of our foreign policy. Exactly what men or groups in the ReJ?ublican Party should be called upon to make cabinet nomi- nations is, it seems to us, a matter best left to the discretion of the President and his negotiations with the Republican Party. The Repub- lican National Executive Commit- tee, the Congressional leadership of the party, or an ad hoc committee representing the several discernable elements within the party are three possibilities. When we say \a new cabinet,\ we mean a full cabinet. Our plan envisages collective cabinet respon- sibility during the next two years. We see no valid presumption against the effectiveness of a modi- .fied plural executive of such brief tenure. We think there is nothing un- constitutional or illegal in the sug- gested procedure. The Pres!dent would obligate himself to follow his cabinet on all matters of policy- to sign bills only on its advice. It would be a \gentlemen's agree- ment.\ There would be no official delegation of executive powers- simply an unusually close adher- ence to the counsel of Presidential advisers. hTe agreement, however, would be no less forceful for this reason. If the President should at any time break his promise, there would be no legal remedy available to the Republicans, but the censure of public opinion would be a com- pelling sanction. ---0---- A few short hours after the three of this issue.

Em·lier this season, we remindeci the student body that it has be- come tradition for the largest possible g-nmp of l'nion men to 111al-:e tlw trek up the :\lohawk \'alley to Clinton for the annual game with the C'lintonicms. At that time, \H' stated that there would be some campus group organizing the t1·ip and asked that YOl. say YE:;: wlwn you are asked to go ahmg. The titHe has C\•Jnlt'. This week, the Delphic Society took the inHiati\·e and formerl a committee to look into and plan the expedition. There \\'ill be buses leaving from Schenectady, to all re- ports, on Saturday morning and retuming after the game. Tickets have been written for and the Delphit:s hope that e\·eryune \\ill tum out for the t1·ip. A brief history of the P\'ent might be apropos at this time. In previous years, Hamilton hns brought most of its enrollment t11 :;:cheneetady for tlw ga111e \\'hen it wa:< held lll'I'l'. On till' Altemate years, Dutch- men han' emlea\·om·ect to re~tch Clinton.

The matter of which we speak is very important in that it effects all members of the college com- munity. Each of us is intet·ested in having a pre- sentable campu;,; and very few of us would deliberately do anything to detract from the beauty which surrounds us. But, by care- lessness, each of us contributes his bit in creating a situation which mars the campus greviously. As we gaze over Library Field, around the Idol and the tennis courts, along· Fraternity Ro\v-in fact, almost everywhere-we see distressing signs of negligence. There are papers, candy wrapped, cigarette packages, lunch bags, and miscellaneous debris scat- tered ever:y\where. The vista is far frcm imposing to the occasional visitor.

The last Hamilton game that we saw in Clinton was in the fall of 19-H. Union had a rather unfortunate season-having won but one g·ame until the Hamilton week-end. :\o, we didn't win at Clinton, but the fight I that an underdog Gamt't eleven made that day will remain long in our memory. But, that W}lsn't the only cheering aspect of the day. On a bl'isk, blowy afternoon, neal'ly foUl' hundred t•nion spectators made an eight~· mile joumey in support of a team which had done far less to wanant support than has the present. Cars of every make and description struggled up and back The l'nion rooters almost outnumbered those of till' Ilamiltun section. That was sdwul ~pitit.l Til is year, the college enrollment is tar I abo\·e that of the last awa\' vear.

KLEEN-UP We have dealt with this problem before. :\Iatters have necessitated action by previous Student Councils. But, the same eyesore in the same places gives the same impression of indifference. Let's all get behind a drive to keep the campus clean. We suggest to the Adminis- tration that they provide ample trash cans at strategic spots to catch the waste which students may be trained to deposit there. We suggest to the Student Council that they' sponsor a drive to make students aware of [ the mess they can collectively create and to train the students to refrain from this mess- making·. We suggest to the Fraternities that they continue the cleaning which most of them have carried on so diligently this Fall.

TERM TESTS Audience of Two Hundred Hears Art Discussion by Noted Teacher Gottlieb '\\\\'~~~~------\\\\\\'~...........,_~~~............,...,.,.,.,.........., 0 Spirit Hits High Pitch as Weekend At the conclusion of the meal, the meeting was put under the chairmanship 0f Student Council President Chester Marvin. The dis- cussion that followed lasted for more than two hours, <:overing many of the problems that have confr0nted both the students and the adminictration since the be- ginning of this term at Union College. Lack of Spirit The issue that seemed of para- mount importance was the neg- ligible amount of interest displayed this year in the activities that have heretofore always been an import- ant part of Union life. While the student views of the existing apathy has been stated before, they were reiterated for the purpose of elicit- ing faculty opinion and suggestions. Although it may be a surprise to some students, the administration stands squarely behind the extra- curricular activities and believes sincerely in their importance. \Union College is not and has never been a place that anyone need be ashamed of,\ said Dr. Davidson in an address to the group. He lashed out strongly at those men both here at Union and those who have graduated who seem to feel that they must apolo- gize for the college. Dr. Davidson apprised his audience of the fact that on a percentage basis there are more men in WHO'S WHO from Union than from any other college. Interest in Admissions In ot,der to avoid congestion, tests during the last two weeks of the semester to give .t ime for review and to prevent con- flicts of classes with examina- tions, the faculty council has voted to change the regulations for end-0f-~emester tests to the followi-ng: 1. In order to al- low courses with several sec- tions to administer uniform tests, no class·es will be held after January 18; but the :five final class days (Jan. 20-21-22- 23) will be allocated as follows: January 20-Divisions 3 and 4 (Science and Engineering); January 21-Division 1 <Hu- manities); January 22-Divi- sion 3 and 4; January 23-Di- vision 2 t Social Studies). Tests will be given at hours and places to be announced later. 2. Smaner colll'ses with sched- uled tests at regular class hours during week of January 13-18, 1947. Danton Writes for New York History Professor George H. Danton of the Modern Languages Division is the author of an article entitled \A Smart Flippant Little Fel- low . . . ,\ Johann Ludwig Tell- lrampf, which appeared in the October issue of New York History. The article gives a brief sketch of Tellkampf's early life and educa- tion in Germany, and of his apoint- pment as Professor at the Uni- versity of Gottingen. .Qf interest is the discussion of his activiies in the United States and of his as- sociation with Union College (as Professor of Political Science and German Literature), from 1838 to 1843. His effect on the general populace of Schenectady during that pet·iod is both amusing and profound. Last Tuesday evening, a large audience of approximately two hundred people, among them thir- ty-five Skidmore students, heard Mr. Harry Gottlieb, well-known art- ist and teacher, lecture on the un- usual silk screen printing process. Mr. Gottlieb's discussion, supple- mented by a sh0rt, educational film, in the main part described the history of this process which, he stated, is the oldest method of printing developed in ancient China. This silk scr.een method is maintained by the speaker to be quite siiYJ.ple and less expensive than a power press for editions numbering under ten thousand, and also can produce many interesting effects. Later in the lecture, other related printing processes w.ere de- scribed and their advantages com- pard with the screen ·process. Far from restricting hirrulelf to a written speech alone, the versatile Mr. Gottlieb treated his audience to a step-by-step demonstration. At the conclusion of his explanations, the whole group discussed the method, asked many questions, and were allowed to pull their own prints under his guidance. In a companion lecture during noon chapel, Tuesday, the artist emphasized that men and women in art work are determined to reach their audiences. This is important, he believes, since the intelligence of the art consumer must be .one of the main springs behind the art movement. The development of this intelligence, he reasoned, cannot be obtained from books, and conse- quently, adequate art education is sadly lacking. This, Mr. Gottlieb concluded, is unfortunate since he believes that a study of common art is essential in education to develop the latent possi·bilities of the public. WE ARE WELCOME! The Student Council of Ham- ilton College has extended a cordial invitation to all Union men to attend a dance to be held at Hamilton tomorrow evening. Admission will be one dollar per couple.

NEW SCHEDULE In order to find what places are available for former stu- dents who are applying for ad- mission at mid-year it is neces- sary for students now in College to arrange their programs of study for the second semester at once. The schedules for all term- one students and for all tech- nical students will be prepared at the Dean's Office. They need not report until called. All other students will•report for preparation of schedules as follows: Students in Divisions I and II to their advisers. Pre-medical and pre-dental students to Profeesor Clark. All general students in Divi- sion III to Professor Morse ex- cept that Professor Chillrud and Professor E. S. C. Smith will prepare schedules for their advisees. Each student will please take his schedule for this semester with him when he •reports to arrange his schedule for next semester. Any students who intend to withdraw from the College or wish to change their entire course of study will please re- port to the Dean. Your cooperation in this mat- ter will help those friends of yours who, as you did, wish to return to theii· college. C. F.

Joseph Finkelstein, instructor of history, ' will analyze the book and lead the discussion. Sumner Wells, former Under- secretary of State, also wrote Time for Decision, another clear analysis of our Foreign Policy of several year ago. His recent book surveys the present American Policy in re- latic.n to the reconstruction of Eu- rope, Latin America, the Near East, and the Far East. Middle Atlantic Conferf'nce The officers of the IRC have an- nounced the part that they will play in the Middle Atlantic Confer· ence, which is to be held Nov. 30 at Vassar College. Jack Tway, presi- dent of the club, will lead a discus- :>ion on U. S. policy in relation to the Balkans. Jack Hallahan, vice- president, will lead discussion on the Petroleum oil of the Near East. Conference on India ActivHies Near The Big Game is on again after the longest Union-Hamilton break in fifty-six years. It is hard for some of us to realize that at one time. Hamilton was our only truly collegiate rival in the neighb.orhood. This rivalry, Union's longest standing, developed because of the proxirr.ity of our colleges and also because the type of footb11l played was a;bout on the same level. The :first game to be played was along about 1890 at which time there were no bleachers, no football field, and no modern equipment. Our men cr.owded into cat·s, not automobiles mind you, until they were packed as tight as s:1rdines, and all just to see this game. There was plenty of spirit in those days. In fact, at one time in 1903, there was a little too much. The fact of the matter is that the spectators started a small scale riot which ended in the first break with Hamilton. This lasted for about two or three years and then we were right back at it again, but in a more friendly way. The next break which we had with Hamilton was the fault of neither sch\1ol but rather the inter- vention of. one Adolph Hitler and crew. We played our last game in November of 1942 and at that time it wcs believed that this game would be the last of its nature until after the war. That forecast proved to .be accurate, because when those two teams left the field in a 14-14 tie, it was the last time that either college had an organized team until this season. Sf\.cond Oldest Riva.lry One of the unique distinctions of this traditional rivalry is that it is the second oldest of its kind in the state and perhaps the second oldest in the country. It is also a different sort of rivalry in that it has re- mained completely friendly. The teams have always fought it .out to the bitter end but have left the field as friends. There is also a strong social attachment between the schools. The Student Council offered its services to the Director of Admis- sions Harold J. Ripton in obtaining desirable applicants to Union. The Council feels that students can do good work in spreading the name and fame of Union College. As a result of this discussion, plans are being formulated for the creati-on of a student group which will aid the Admissions office in visiting various schools throughout the area. The Council feels that prospective applicants can talk more easily to a student approximately their own age and would be interested in the student viewpoint. The meeting was concluded at 9:30. The concensus of opinion was that the exchange of ideas and information was highly successful. Plans have been tentatively made for future meetings of the same nature. The remainder of the article covers Te!lkampf's experiences at Columbia University and of his eventual return to Germany in 1846. Professor Danton's paper brings to the reader not only the life of the subject but the life of the College and Schenectady in the days of E!iphalet Nott. 0 Prexy to Speak to Alumni at Clinton Gridiron Ball Brings Back Plans are now ·being formulated for a college conference, to be held late this winter. Some of the area colleges that will participate are Skidmore, R.P.I., Russell Sage, Siena, and Albany State Teachers College. More details on both the Middle Atlantic and the India Con- ference will be announced at a later date. ---a•--- Most of the fraternities that are represented on our campus are also represented on theirs. It has been customary for the host college to extend invitations to the visiting students of the other col- lege who would then participate in whatever post-ga·me activities there might be.

Free ticltets will be distributed to the public. Requests for these ticltets should be mailed or tele- phoned to the President's Office. and Mid-West. Decorations Novel The Ball was held in Alumni Gymnasium which was decorated in lteeping with the spirit of the football theme brought out by walls stt·ipped with gr.een and white ma- terial simulating a football field and a large golden football placed behind the band stand accompanied with smaller footballs placed throughout the hall. A gleaming fountain in the .center of the floor completed the picture. Booths for the fraternities were situated for the first time on the indoor trac!{ !l.bove the gym floor, a situation that proved highly eco- nomical in regard to floor space leaving the entire main floor of the gym for dancing. The entire scene was topped with a great false ceiling of gt,een ma- terial on which green spotlights situated at various points on the indoor tt•ack played. At Union Nearly Everyone Mr. Davis' appointment com- pletes the enlarged library staff necessitated by 75 per cent increase in Union's enrollment, according to Helmer \iV'ebb, librarian. He will assist in counseling students on study source material. A 1942 graduate \with high dis- tinction\ from the University of Rochester, Mr. Davis served in the administi,ative branch of the Army ·Medical Corps.

According to Hal Wittner, two hun- dred to three hundred tickets have been sold a.nd the rest on reserve will be taken up before game time. Among the fraternities represented at the game, Kappa Alpha will have about eight men there, Sigma Chi another twelve. Sigma Phi about five, and Phi Delta Theta will send at !e!lst five or six. From all reliable reports, those who are going should see a good game. According to Mel Hein. the boys on the team seem to be in excellent s·hape and are full of determination to win. On the record of this season, Union has had a slightly better winning aver- age than Hamilton. However, the game this weekend is always a jinx.

There will be, we hope, a large group of Union men present for the game. There will be, we hope, evidence of fi.rm support for the Dutchmen eleven which has stmggled up from an apparently dis- astrous record to a possible .500 reco1·d. This year, Union has been spotty. At times, the team showed promise of great strength and at other times, it sunk to the depths. There were moments of brilliance and moments of inefficiency. In every sense, the football season now closing has been an up and down season. But, there is a fact which should stand out over all others. At no time, when the score was definitely against us as it was at \'ermont and Rochester, did the team stop trying. At Rochester, a numerically stronger and victory-scenting Yellowjacket eleven was played to a standstill dul'ing the fourth period when they had already clinched the game. The 'Cnion eleven, playing without the services of Hal Enstice came from deep :n their own territory late in the game to score their second touchdown-one ·which could have no effect on the game's outcome. At Vermont, a hard-charging Catamount squad was surprised time and again by the spirit of a badly tmunced Garnet team. At Hobart, Union came from behind to win. In last Satm·day's game, the team came from behind once to tie the score and, in the closing seconds, made a touchdown and con- version-again which could not effect the final outcome. There is little that we can say. Ft·om the man who scores the winning touchdowns or makes the spectacular runs down through the unhemlded lineman who sweats and grimaces under the pounding of opposition l::icl,_, 1« l:\. :-uL.,tJ-lLllco \lill< oLUtcJ ct;J :d: year, did not go on the tri.:ps and perhaps played but a few minutes during the season, each man deserved the adulations of the entire student body. The guys whl'l worked, perhaps unsuccessfully, to give Union a \Vin- ning team don't want praise. All they wnnt is a bit of appreciation for what tl!ey have done. They \Vant little and should receive a lot. The main \vay that we c~m show om appreciation is to get out for the game to- morrow. Get up to Clinton. Get seats and cheer, no matter what the score may be. Show a little of the spirit which should be shown. The spirit of the 1·ooters this year has, on the whole, been below par. The1·e have been moments such as the R.P.I. week-end when the majority of the college got out and gave. There have been others when the actions of the stands made us ashamed. One of those moments was Saturday-when the breaks were going against us, \rhen the offi.cials made what appeared to be a bad decision that may have cost us the game, when penalties were exacted for offenses which the spectators could not Ol' would not understand. Despite the protests of the cheer-leaders, there was a general chorus of booing. That is not sportsmanship. But, there is still time to atone for the mishaps of the season. If every man who can physically do so gets up to Clinton, marbe by hitch-hiking, and if every man cheers for all his worth, this season can finish on the successful side of the ledger. Give the team the support it deserves. Give the college the support it deserves. Give a bit. We think ~·ou'll enjoy it and we know that the team will appreciate your apprecia- tion. SOUTH COLLEGE SPEAKS In keeping with the clean-up program which we suggested in our last issue, we have again heard the complaint that a situation which was aired earliet· in the semester has not been taken care of-despite assurances that action >vould be taken. The 1natter of which we speak is the condition of the yard behind South College Dormitory. l\Iembers of the Dorm came to the Student Council at one of the first meet- ings of the year and asked whether some- thing might not be done to cover up the trash cans from the Dorm, These cans, filled with the debris from the college, are left exposed to the view of any and all passers-by. During the warm weather seasons, they might easily become a somce of disease. Dming the Fall and Winter, the danger of contagion is minimized but the condition remains unsightly. The Student Council was asked to act upon this matter. A committee was formed to investigate and suggest possible measures. The investigation and the suggestions were duly carried out and presented. Then, the Council passed the suggestions along· to the proper authorities. In due time, they were assured that action was being taken. Covers were being constructed. Now, however, the situation has arisen again. Last Tuesday we were present when a resident of the South College Dorms once more expressed his displeasure that the cans were still uncovered and unenclosed. We investigated. The reports are true. There is no doubt that the rear of the Donn is extremely ill-kept. We would like to suggest that the proper authorities, who would be, in this case, the college physician, the con1ptroller, and the Superintendent of the coHege, see for them- selves the mess which exists and, having seen, have trash can covers and racks made and installed. HALE HOUSE BRIGANDS In the past, there have b~en complaints that the magazines placed in the Student Lounge of Hale House have been rifled before most of the habitues of that lounge have had a chance to read them. Now, Mrs. Briggs comes forth with the complaint that the periodicals which are purchased for the use of ALL students are once again disappearing, almost as soon as they arrive. There is no reason for this lack of con- sideration. The use of the Lounge entails certain responsibilities. These responsibilities are the orderly use of provided facilities and the consideration of others who wish to make use of the room. In a college such as ours, with the present crowded conditions, co- operation must be the key-word. Let's stop this petty pilfering and un- necessary mutilation of the Hale House magazines. Think of the othel' fellow.

ATOM SPECIALIST The Story of HERB POLLOCK IN 1937, after receiving his doctor's degree as a You Have the Nation's Best Stocked Pipe Shop VOTTIS PIPE SHOP 130 ERIE BLVD. or See Our UNION COLLEGE BRANCH BASEMENT OF PSI U Nick Pruyn and Mush Peltz, In Charge Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, Herbert C, Pollock came to work in the General Electric Research Laboratory. He knew that at G.E. he would find facilities, opportunity and encouragement to con- tinue his fundamental research into the secrets of the atom. This was important to Herb. As a senior at the U. of Virginia in 1933, he had studied methods of concentrating isotopes. His doctor's thesis at Oxford was on isotope separation. At Virginia and at Oxford Herb specialized in problems of isotope separation. When war approached in 1939, isotopes- specifically the uranium isotope 235-became the subject of feverish study, as men sought to exploit the atom's enormous energies. Herb put aside his research into pure science. Working with another G-E scientist, Dr. K. H. Kingdon, he succeeded in preparing a .sample of U-235 which was used to confirm the fact that it was this isotope which fissioned under slow neutron bombardment. Later he joined Dr. E. 0. Lawrence's Manhattan Project group which was at work on the atomic bomb. With the Research Laboratory again today, Herb has resumed the fundamental research he began at Virginia and Oxford. Using such complex electronic \tools\ as the G-E betatron, he studies the atom that man may have, not bombs, but new sources of power, new weapons against disease, new truths about the physical world. Nexl to schools and the U. 5. Governmenl, General Electric is the largest employer of college engineering graduates. Today in the G·E Research laboratory he uses I he betatron in his atom studies.

The Garnet hill-and-dalers were nosed out by Middlebury last Sat- urday in one of the closest meets of the season. Union pulled down the second and third slots while Middlebury won the first and fourth. The meet was won on the runner-up p.ositions however as Middlebury took sixth through eleventh places to edge the home team out by a 26-29 score. Newman or Middlebury came in first, stopping the clock at 26:57. Culver and Hicks grabbed the next two positions with respective times of 27:42 and 27:56. They were fol- lowed closely by the visitor's MaE>on with a time of 28:19 and Brightman of Union clocking 28:36. The final meet of the season was run under poor weather conditi-ans. It was a cold and cloudy day with a mixture of intermittent rain and snow that made running difficult and slow. Bill Ketz's team finished up the season on the winning side of the ledger. They won three out of five ·Of the meets for a 60% average for the year. The two losses were suf- fered at the hands of RPI to a score of 33-22 and Middlebury last weekend by 26-29. The most out- standing of the tht·ee victories was the defeat of Brooklyn Poly by a perfect score of 15-40. In thi.s meet in New York, the Garnet men fin- ished with the first six positions. The other two meets won were with Vermont and Williams. Vermont was beaten by 22-33 to open the season, and Williams was on the long end of a 26-29 score. After a me-eting of the Awards Committee of the Athletic Depart- ment last Monday, the award of Block \U's\ to six members of the 1946 Cross-Country team and of \aUa's\ to four members of the squad was announced. Heading the list of Block \U\ awards were Newt Culver and Gil Hicks, consistent point gainers for the Garnet. Other major letters went to Don Brightman, Stan Coben, Fred Steigert and Joe Har- mon, manager. \aUa's\ were be- stowed upon Carl Byron, Jacques Cassidy, Hal Larkin and El Modlin, manager-elect. Culver, who earned a letter with the harriers in 1944, was the lead- ing scorer for the Dutchmen. He placed first in the Vermont meet, and tied for first in the Brooklyn Poly and Williams races. Hicks was an outstanding miler on the track squad last spring and made an exceptional showing in his first try at longer distances. Brightman received a letter as a member of the 1944 squad. He tied for first in the Brooklyn meet, scored third at Vermont, fifth in the Middlebury run, sixth against Williams and finished in ninth posi- tion in the RPI tussle.

Y., FRIDAY, 'NOVEMBER 22, 1946 D·r.·H. G. Canady; 'Noted Phycholog:ist Lectures to Campus on Race Relations States We Must Act Now to~ Begin Social Advancement, Regain Valuable Lost Time On Campus Dr. Herman G. Canady, noted Negro psychologist, has spent the past week on the campus lectut·ing to psychology and social studies classes on race relations in the United States and throughout the world. On Tuesday he was guest speaker at the assembly period and talked on \Getting the Most Out of Life.\ Dr. Canady received his M.A. de- , gree fnom Northwestern University in 1928 and his Ph.D. from the same institution in 1941 under a Rosenwald Fellowship. He is a member of Sigma Xi, American Psychological Association, Ameri- can Teachers Association, Ameri- can Association for the Advance- ment of Science, and the American· Association of University Profes- sors. He recently contributed chap- tel'S to two important books, ''Psy- chology for the Armed Services\ and \Twentieth Century Psychol- ogy.\ Now head of the Department of Psychology at West Virginia State Col'lege, where he has taught for the past eighteen years, Dr. Canady is traveling thtoughout the country visiting the various colleges and universities as Race Relations Lec- turer of American Friends Service Committee. Social Advancement Lags Speaking before an American Civilization class he pain ted out that the social growth of the world is approximately 1,000 years behind its technical advancement at the present time. All the energies andre- sources of the world are now being employed to develop atom bom~s, rocket ships, and weapons of bio- logical warfare, but little time is spent in trying to understand the various peoples of the world or to work out methods by which they may all get along peaceably to- gether. \Two billions are allocated to scientific research but not two cents to social research,\ he said. Prejudices to Blame Continuing, he explained that most of the problems of the world center around racial or religious differences. Few people stop to realize that as individuals they are equal. Instead, they classify peo- ple into groups. Peopre think of. a policeman as being in a certam g~oup and they think of a college p~ofessor as falling into an en- tirely different classification. Yet strip the policeman and the pro- fessor of their raiment and they cannot be told apart. Underneath, they are equa:l as individuals. The Negro, as an example, is classifi~d by his \uniform his dark skm. Unfortunately, however, he cannot remove his raiment. He must therefore suffer merely because his skin Is not the same color as the majority of the people's. Th~ same applies to Indians and Onentals and other groups with colored skins. Democratic Hypocricy honored this week by their nomina- tion as the college's repres·entatives to be included in this year's edition of \Who's Who in American Col- leges and Universities.\ The selec- tions were made· on a basis of scholastic and extra-currieular achievement.

Pritchard of Sche- nectady has undertaken the job of alumni adviser for the recently or- ganized Union College Society of Pre-Law students, according to an announcement by Dr. Joseph D. Doty, the society's faculty adviser. Mr. Pritchard is a graduate of the class of '40. While at Union, he majored in history and government. During his senior year he won the Freling H. Smith prize in history. Immediately after his graduation he entered an accelerated course at the Albany Law School, graduating from there in 1942. He has prac- tic·ed in Schenectady since he passed the bar exam. The society, according to Dr. Doty, was organized as a result of a great interest on the part of pre- law students in obtaining informa- tion about their future profession. At the first election th·e following officers were chosen: Stanley Sut- ton, class of '47, president; Richard Roberts, class of '48, vice president; and Jack Tway, class of 48, secre- tary. Two meetings have already been held. The first meeting was ad- dressed by Andrew V. Clements, Dean of the Albany Law School, who spoke on the legal and inter- national aspects of the Nurenberg trials. The second meeting was ad- dressed by Professor Samuel H. Hesson of the Albany Law School, who spoke on the ethics of the legal profession. It is the plan of the society to hold more meet- ings of this type throughout the year dealing with various other aspe~ts of the lawyer in practice, and in other activities. ----0 Week End Misdeeds Deplored By Wires The following telegrams were ex- changed after a discue-sion held be- tween representatives of THE CONCORDIENSlS and THE HAM- ILTONEWS after vandalism. that occurred both here and at Clinton last weekend.

That is, it had remained thus until the events of last week. Thursday evening, some en·ant students, who very obviously are still in the short- pants stage and have no conception of either manhood or gentlemanly conduct, paid a visit to the tiny upstate community of Clinton, intent on displaying what to their warped minds was probably termed \college spirit.\ When they were through with their typically high school prank, the Hamilton campus was bedecked in Garnet paint spelling the slogan, \Beat Hamilton.\ This was unprecedented in our relations with Hamilton. As should be expected, Hamilton retaliated by painting portions of our campus with its colors and the slogan, 'Beat Union.\ All this did nothing to strengthen the cordial relations between the two schools.

We would like to urge the College Ad- ministration to take definite steps to prevent any future occurrence of such infantile activity. We recommend that the Adminis- tl·ation create and enforce a rule which would provide summary dismissal for any student involved in such action. -AKH DE tl EXAMS-TO BE OR NOT TO BE Let's g-et out of this rut which the students all seem to have gathered in during the last few weeks. Let's forget about the bug-a-boo which many of us have created in our minds. Let's make a little sense in this exam problem. Earlier in the semester, the greater part of the student body greeted joyously the announcement that the college was tem- porarily doing away with final exams. It seemed pretty fine then, didn't it? It didn't take long for us to find the flaw in the nice little Utopia we had set up for ours~lves. Even now, we shudder when the words HOUR EXAMS are mentioned. It was pretty rough-most of us had a long series of tests almost every week. We even know of one poor fellow who had five exams in two days-two of them in one class. Pretty rough! But, with the exuberance of youth, most of us reasoned that the additional work we were putting in now would return in the dividend of no final exams. It was a sad day for a lot of us when several professors made the announcement that they intended giving final exams in addition to the hour tests. It seemed like a conspiracy, didn't it? Last week, the President came forth with the statement that the last four days of the semester would be given up for the con- solidation of classes with numerous sections. We appreciate the feelings of many who im- mediately assumed that there would be the usual set of finals to stew over. They, in their unthinking immaturity, seized upon the statement, innocent in itself, as a definite confirmation ofthe rumors going-around that final exams were still a reality. To clear up the situation, let us state that there is no program of finals in prospect for the college as a whole at the present time. There have been no concerted efforts on the parts of department heads to bring- back the old system. We have conferred with Presi- dent Davidson on this matter and received the following explanation. The purpose of the exam schedule posted in the last issue of the CONCORDIENSIS was to indicate that there would be UNI- FORM HOUR TESTS during the last week of the semester. BUT, the exam schedule is not intended for those classes which have but one section. In many classes there are numerous sections-all necessitating- separate exams. The Administration of the college is attempting to alleviate this problem with the establishment of joint hour test periods during which the sections may be combined in one or more rooms to take a uniform exam-thus easing the strain placed upon the professors in the last few hectic days of the marking period. There is no intention of placing exams before the student body as a whole. Perhaps some of us will have final exams. Perhaps others of us will be fortunate in not having last minute sessions. The fact re- mains that none of us should fear an ex- amination. A student who has carried out all his assignments will have little to fear from the questions which a professor could ask him. In any case, let's get out from under this self-imposed burden of worry. There's no reason to become irate. There will be no final exams-in the accepted sense. Come to think of it, the majority of the students indicated that they have little to fear from exams at the Mid-semester mark- ing period. There were fewer men placed on warning than ever before. Also, colleg-e marks were generally higher than ever before. Why all the beefing? It's the first of the month - every few days. The first few days of the month were once a time of feverish activity for tele- phone accounting personnel. In that short period millions of telephone bills had to be prepared, checked and mailed. :But the Bell System accounting staff, seeking to level off this work peak, found a practical solution. It's called \rotation billing.\ Now in our accounting departments. a new month hegins every few days. Accounts are divided into six or more even groups, each with a different hill. ing date. This spreads the work evenly and eliminates the old last-minute rush. This special problem, solved hy tele· phone accountants, is typical of those which often confront management in the many branches of our business. They present a stimulating challenge to the young men with initiative and imagina- tion who will find just such practical solutions ... young men who find teleph· ony an exciting and rewarding cateer.

The entl of this road, however, has apparently been reached. By the Pnd of October it became apparent that the dining hall was losing approximately $tOO a clay, and the Boa.rd of Trus- tees voted to increase the mea I priC'es at oncP.

And fourth. to intet·est more student.s in Union and to make Union the first choice rather than the second or third when the high school student thinks of college. The prop-osal:> made wet e: 1. \'To have two teams of five students each, representing the vat ious courses of study and Pxtra· cunicular activities, organized for the purpose of visiting various t'chools. with the intention of intPr· esting men in l:nion College. Mem- bers of the faculty would be ap· pointed to be in charge of and to accompany each team on the ad· mission trips. One of the !Pams would concentrate on schools in New England. while the other on those within the areas of Penn»yl- vania, Delawme, and Maryland. It was suggested that these trips br planned for the ten-day period of mid-semester recess.\ 2. \That a planned program of action at the schools which the team visits consist of a moving picture, short di>'cussions by Paeh member of the team. and lastly. an open discussion between the .stu- dent body of the respective schools and the team. It is further sug- gested that the admissions office make arrangements beforehand with the various schools listed on the itinerary so that as many schools as pos>'ible may be covered in this time.\ 3. \The Delphic Society also pro- posPs that in those areas where Union College is now well repre- sented, students l'md alumnl be dele- gated as spokesmen to carry on a similar program as outlined above.\ sa o rom omm1Hees nique in America, gave a brillian-t Future Band P:la:ns 1 Disclosed by Ma1le In an inh .. l'\·iew ht~t Tul'stlay, Dr. Charles :llalP, Din•ctur uf the Uniun Col!egt• Band, stah>d that the col-: lt•gp was 1 PplPSl'tltT'\Li th1s yPar by. a band that was bigg<'l\ and better I than ever.

Carter Davidson The Interfraternity Council at Its meeting on November 12 pledged 300 dollars for the improvement of the College's dancing facilities, in- 1 , eluding spotlight~·. permanent dec- orations, and a bandstand. It is ex- : pected that the Student Counci·l wtll provide additional funds to augment this sum. The net result of this move will be tha-t in the future dance com- mittees will be saved the expendi- ture of the large sums used in the past to rent these ba£>ic commod- ities. Until this year twenty per- cent of all total funds have had to br set aside for this purpose.
