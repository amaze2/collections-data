The Sophomores started with Wein-. held center, and Lyman and Hagar guards. The game was very loose on both sides in the first half. The Sopho- mores evidently had a horse-shoe somewhere for the ball seen1.ed to go into the basket from any angle. This more or less bewildered the \Frosh\ who utterly neglect-ed their aggressive in trying to defend their basket. Weinhold and Hughes popped two field baskets each: \Wild Bill'' Dougafl made three and Hagar one. Eddy shot two foul points and the first half closed 16-2 in favor of '20. In the second half both teams tight- ened up a bit in their playing. Beattie and Lefkowitz were substit_uted ·for Weinhold and Lyman, and Scherer for Vaug\hn. The Frosh started out with a walton. Rolls and Scherer both score~ and Rolls made a third foul point. Meanwhile Lefkowitz . made two more field baskets hut the Sop- homores didn't show the drive which they had in the first half.

The foHowing is presented· as a summary of his remarks: There have been three methods used in forming a conception of mind. The first one advanced by Descartes as- sumed that there is an impassible bar- rier between mind and matter, that they have nothing in common. It, therefore, denoted mind as a distinc- tive spiritual substance or soul sub- stance. The so-called introspection of James instituted the second concept of mind. It of necessity is nothing more than a fairly accurate idea of one's own mind. James described it as a stream of consciousness. The third concept took its beginning among those men who were engaged in investigating the minds of animals. It is the concept of the observer which is obtained from the actions of the subject observed. Obviously each one of these con- ceptions alone is incomplete and er- roneous. The first one meets an ob- gtacle in the fact that no mental con- cepbon is possible without recourse to material objects; the second con- ception is too exclusive, the third is not sufficiently profound. The animal observer depends entire· ly upon the behavior of the animal for his knowledge of his mind. Plainly much of the subtlty and perhaps the very essence of that particular mind will escape him. That the consideration of one's own mind is too narrow for a general con- cept of mind may be shown by the following examples. In reality one's mind is his world. Helen Keller's mind must, therefore, he very differ- . ent from our own. The loss of the (Continued on Page 2) CALENDAR.

In the article we are referring to, the argument is supported by ,an ex- tract fro manother Harvard publica- tion, the Harvard Alumni Bulletin-a letter from a man who took the academic course and now that he is in the army he advises college men to study the technical subjects. He says: \I went to a very fashionable hoarding-school, and afterwards to a large university.

DEARTH OF INFIELDERS Thirteen Twirlers Aspire to the Mound and Plenty of Freshmen Cover the Outfield Positio·ns. Saturday's baseball practice offered a pleasant sctrprise, from the fact that about thirty aspirants donned their togs and signified intentions of com- ing out for the team. A large number of the new candidates are seeking out- field and battery positions. Contrary to other years, the list of infielders re- mains comparatively small. The pitching staff is working under full steam. The number of twirlers is now raised to 13, Smulker of Glovers- ville High, being the newest addition. In his work Saturday he showed sotne good stuff and gives promise of an in- teresting future. The other candi- dates for the mound are now, Joe Brucker, Hughes, Beaver, Benedict, Mallery, Hanley, Rosenthal, Gulick, J:vfcGroot, Thebo, Dooley and Laskow- sky. Hal Wittner still remains the heavy man for catcher, and if he is CJ.llowed to play, Garnet fans may breath easy so far as this position is concerned. Besides Wittner, there are three other candidates, Hochuli, Jones and Schamberger, and a possibility that Schwartz of Poughkeepsie, will also come out. As for the infield, Captain Peaslee, Collins and Fancher of last year are out. Moynihan, the remaining veteran infielder, has not yet put ip ·his ap- pearance, though it is anticipated that he will do so very soon now. George Brucker and Tracy are the only new ca-t~didates for infield positions. Although there is a dearth of infield material, the outfield has been blessed (Continued on Page 4) CALENDAR. iOO COUPLES ATTEND Good Dance and Financial Suc- ,cess Crown Efforts of Committee.
