Schenectady, New York Thursday, February 1, 1979 'Paper Lion' Speaks _ by JIM DAVIS Speaking before a sparse audience at Memoricil 'Chapel Tuesday evening, George t>litnpton; the man kn<~wn as \the professional amateur,\ kept the ,small crowd en- tertained with easy banter and a humorous series of witty anec<lotes about hi~ varied experiences. _, Plimpton, wttose more well- known activities have included playing quarterback for NFL football teams, .pitching to major league aU-stars at Yankee Stadium,. and playing for professional nockey and basketball teams, .said his most sever.e test didn't come· in an athletic competition. \My most frightening ex- perience,'' be said, ''was playing for the New York Philharmonic for a month in a tour of Canada.\ - Performing for the Philharmonic, ''the greatest orchestra in the world/' was so demanding because \there's nQ roomfor.error. You can't make mistakes. In sports, on the other hand,. the whole idea is to force your opponent into errors~ So my mistaltes were uri• derstandable.\ The. athletes he trained and competed with were friendly and accepted his efforts with '\pleasant amusement.\ Plhnpton likened them to \hosts where I was the .guest. As long as I behaved, they welcomed m:e.\ One of his more memorable encounters took place in 1969 when he traine(l and played with the NBA champion Boston Ce_ltics, seeing action in· an exhibition game against the Atlanta Hawks. When the Celtics fell behind by about 15 points., he remembered, Bill Russell, the Celtics' coach, sent him in. Somehow, his team closed the gap to four points. Thinking he could win the contest, Russell pulled out Plimpton and replaced him with John Havlicek, an all-time great. With a sense of amusement, Plimpton recalled that the Celtics did not win the game. Afterward, he said,. he found Russell and chastised him for his \tactical mistake.'·' He added, wryly, that Russell did not talk to him again for some time. ~covem3nce Report Released In another incident, Pl!glpton played hockey for the ~n Bruins in a 1977 exhibition game against the Philadelphia Flyers. Knowing he \would be embarrassed,'? · Plinlpton . said ;be decided to have some fun. ' - After approximately six months of work, tbe Drafting Committee on - GoUeg~ Governance·-- issues : · ·- ifs· preliminary report calling for a revision of the Governance structure; rn the present system, policy is implemented b-y the All College. Senate (composed of administrators, faculty ;<md students}, Which, after reviewing repOrts fr.om. its committees, makes recom- mendations to the Board of Trustees through the College President and-or Provost. This system was initiated in 1971, and in the eyes of. many has evolve-d into an ''unwieldy mop.ster.\ Following the \tense and bitter\ year that has just ended:, , and in light of the College's self study reqUired by the Middle States...Colllnlission on Higher Education, _it was suggested that the decision making process of tbe College be overhauled. The feeling of the Drafting Committee (C.W. Huntle,y, Gardner Ketchum, Byron Nichols, Chairman, George Reynolds, Steve Richards, Anton Ward~) is that any proposed govel'Jlance system Should be \for an irrstitution whose major concern is un- dergra9Wite education in the liberal arts and engineering~ a system .which must enha~ce and not detract .from effectl'Ve administration, and a system which 9vercomes the problems which have emerged in the existing. system.\ It is imperative to keep in mind that this report is preliminary and open to discussion. In fact the com- mittee encourages all those \concerned about 'governance' at Union College.\ to respond to this document. To this end, ten complE:te copies hav-e been placed on reserve in Shaeffer Library. The following has been taken from the Drafting Cominittee' s own overview of their recom- . mendations. These proposals are expanded upon the actual report: ~ , , PART I An Ov:erview of Our / Recommendations WHA\f A GOVERNANCE SYSTEM DOES. As we reviewed the literature on governance systems and Can-did:ates ' ' To by STEVEN G. SINGER Two ·of the four candidates being considered for the position of dean of admissions and financial aid, Kenneth A. NourseandThomas S. Anthony, will visit Union next week for a series of interviews, tours, and open meetings. Nourse, the first of the two candidates will arrive here Monday, F'eb. 5, and stay . overnight. A graduate of Middlebury College, Nourse is currently the director of altimni relations at his ahna mater, where he had previously worked as both the director of public affair'S and associate •. director of development. He is also presently a consultant to various colleges . in the field of admissions, as well as an active member of both regional and national admissions agencies. Prior to his tenure at Mid- dlebury, Nourse was the dean of admissions at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, attaining that position after several years as associate dean of students and director of adrO.issions. Nourse has also worked as the director of admissions at both Clarkson Junior College and the Rochester Institute of Teclmology. Thomas S. Anthony, another of the final candidates, will be at Union on Feb. 8 and '9, Thuvsday and Friday. discussed specific issues with individ!¥lls at Uniop, it became increa~dngly Clear to U$ that any governance system ·perf()rms three distinct functions : (a) general policies are made arid then subsequently applied to individual cases; (b) people are reviewed and evaluated; and (c) advice is given to the President-and through him to ·the Board of j'rustees-about all matters ·of concern to the College as a whole. It also became increasingly clear to us that these three functions are most efficiently and effectively performed in very different ways. We ultimately reached the conclusion that it made little se~se to have a singl:e body or structure which was respon- sible for the performance of all of these functions, such as the College Senate has. been in the existing system. We have, therefore, proposed a governance .systein which has no over-{lrching single structure and which places responsibility for coor!fin'\tion in the office of the President. We .have also adopted a system. of .nomen- . clature which seeks to make clear the particular functions we have delineated: policies Visit Originally of Proyidence, R.I., Anthony is the present associate dean of admissions at Colgate University. He has held that position since 1972. Until that time be had been the assistant dean of admissions there. Anthony first began ad- missions work in 1965 as an, admissions counselor at Hobart University, the school where he received his B.A. that same year. Before receiving his M.A. in 1968 at the University of Connecticut, Anthony was named assistant director of admissions at Colby College. His experience also includes work in financial aid and data processing, two of the fun- damental requirements for the Continued on pagE 5 will be recommended by CGQnclls, individuals will be reviewed and evaluated by Boards, · and advice will be given to tlte President by CGnsultaUon Groups.· What follows in this section of the report is a very brief descrip- tion of the particular structures we are recommending in each area, along with charts and diagrams. Subsequent parts of the report will analyze each particular structure in much greater detail, including the procedures we recommend that it follow in performing its duties. THE POLICY COUNCILS. We have recommended three separate policy cotmclls which will have responsibility for separate areas of concern.: The Academic Affairs Council, The Student Affairs Council, and the Administrative Affairs Council. It is important to note t~at, with one exception, their decisions wlll be forwarded directly to the responsible. administrator _and through the administrator directly to the Board of Trustees for approval and implementation. These are not committees who bring their Continued on page 4 As a goalie, he would wear a mask. While most are of~ plain color, Plimpton had a large blue eye painted on his, making him look like ua giant cyclops.\ ''I figured it would terrify . shooters. But some of the Bruins told me it also made a good target. I decided not to wear it.\ Further, he observed that pro teams' success can be vital to a city's spirit. As an example he cited the New York Yankees, \who are as respcJnsible\ as any group for the city's revival.\ One of Plimpton '.s future plans is, to manage the Yankees in a spring training game next season. He's also considering playing in a rock music group and as goalie for the New York Cosmos p~ofessional soccer team. \I bad a lot of fun speaking at Union,\ he said. Ws a good bet that he'll have the same entllusiasm for whatever further endeavors he attempts'-and that they will generate equally fascinating tales as the ones he spun here last Tuesday night. .

Page 2 OONOORDIENf!,lfS, February 1, 1919 Winds Of Change After a full term of work, the Middle\States Association Review Committee on Governance has just released Its preliminary recommendations for a change in college governance. A copy of this report is now available to all members of the campus com- rnunity. We recommend strongly that everyone interested in the future of this college scrutinize this report carefully. Governance ls an important facet of colle.ge life that influences each one of us. For those who believe the present system to be cumbersome, complex, and inefficient, which probably cpmprises a majority of the stndents, faculty, and administrative con- stituencies, now is the time to express your opinions. We believe that indeed, the present system of governance is unworkable, inefficient, .and too ex- pensive to be worthwhUe for a college the size of Union. The present governance structure is cornposed of the All-College Senate and a large array of sta;nding committees. To illustrate the self-defeating nature of the present process, we need only to recall the ''Honors Program\ proposal of last year. The Ed-:'cational Policy Committee ( E PC) considered an :Honors program for almost two years under the leadership of Prof. Nichols; studying the feasibility of its im- plementation as well as the scope and content of the program. Upon introduction to the Senate, the proposal was rejected for a perceived lack of funding. We feel that, if the system had permitted the two separate bodies to work as one, the valid objections raised might better have been dealt with and hence, two years oJ valuable work would not have been wasted. The proposed governance system. would preClude the above situation from repeating since the Advisory Boards which study new programs will also ultimately rule whether such programs will be sent to the Board of Trustees for approvaL This thus streamlines the entire governance process. The lines of authority would also be more clearly defined and no standing committees would be utilized (only ad hoc committees would exist). The manner in which the new system would function is clearly a vast im- provement over the present structure. The major concern that we have, however, is the ever present reservation: How will the proposed system affect student voicf· in college affairs? The governance structure adopted in 1971, which was similar to the present structure, was instituted with the idea of increasing student participation in order to establish the student constituency as a major force in college policy~making. It is our perception that the proposed system is not only more efficient, but indeed protects the interests of students by granting what we believe is adequate representation. Our only major objection rests with the composition ofthe Student Review Board. The report endorses the idea of peer review. Why then do students compr i'se less than one-third of this board? We do not object to the placement of faculty and administrators on this review board but do take issue with the dispropor- tionate representation involved. We also raise questions as to the involvement of the campus trustees in the new system. Why have they not been included on many of the advisory boards in the proposed system? The question regarding their role as liaison between the Board of Trustees and the campus advisory structure should be addressed. We endorse the proposed governance report, ex- cepting a few p'oints of which we take issue and, in addition, praise the committee for its work in developing ideas for the best means of governing Union. We invite all members of the campus community to submit opposing and-or concurring viewpoints. In order for a final draft of this report to reflect the sense of the campus on the issue of governance, we are interested in devotiilg a portion of this page for the pl,lrpose of an open forum on this issue. <!lnnrur Editors-in-Chief Associate Editor News Editors Feature Editors Layout Editor Arts Editor Sports Editors PhOto Editors Copy Editor Finelines Calendar Business Manager ~f6'•, . .:::>r~·~ 17 {-\1~~·!~ 95 birnsts ?J~~.~'fl +/lLl.J~ ~ut\'\' David R1,1bin, David Sc.hmertz Matt Nagorsky Jim Davis, Doug Rosenfeld Donna Creeley ,.Sue Barnhart · Terri Moran Steve Monosson Matt Kayne, Mark Palomba Cary Feuerman, Pat Wright Sara Simmons JanDeoeka Melissa Cragin Andrew Wisoff Photo Staff Jonny Bamel.

Kappa Alpha ( 1825), Sigma Phi (1827) and Delta Phi (1826) were the first college frater- nities in the United States.

The social fraternities took intercollegiate status wh\!n a group came over the mountains from Wil.Jiamstown in 1833 and took back a charter from the Kappa Alpha Society. Tradition says, and with great .emphasis, that the Williams men made their expedition in hope of obtaining a charter of Phi Beta Kappa. The Union Phi Beta Kappa men received them hospitably, but expressed a doubt as to the competence of their Alpha chapter of New York to create another chapter outside the state bollhdaries. If the story is to be believed. however, they .pointed out that something '·'just as good\ could be obtained from Kappa Alpha, then eight years old.

OONOORDIENSfS, Februa;ry 1, 1979 ( ', Renovations To_ Begin Robert Rassmussen, vice president for college resources Get Away From Schenectady , byPAMRYAN Ever dream about trading a Schenectady winter for one in Greece~ Or maybe spending a fall term in Italy? Or the spring in Austria? Well, Union offers the chance to do· these and moJe. Union's Term Abro'ad Tuesday, Feb. 6, from 4:30-5:.30 p.m. in SS016. It is IM- PORTANT that aU interested students attend this meeting. At this time, applications and information will be made available, and questions will be answered. Applications will be filed at this time for ALL terms abroad offered next year, and acceptances for all programs should be determined by the en.d of winter term. So don't forget! If you think you might be interested in taking a term abroad:... if not this year, then next--be sure to at- tend the meeting on Feb. 6 ffom· 4:30 to 5:30 in SS016. by .JIM DAVIS With .$200,000· in funding ap- provecl by th.e Board of Trustees, the long.awaUed renovation program .for Union's athletic fields is scheduled to begin this spring. But this money covers only the first phase of the $1.5 million project, and there is no guarantee .ad- ditional cash will be allocated so that the program can be completed. Initially, Garis and Library fields wiU be refurbished. According to present plans, bids will be received for t)lis work in Marcll and ApriL \Work on· Garis coUld begin as early as April,\ said Athletic ~ Director RichardS. Sakata .. But · he added that these . \target dates\ are only tentative.·· He t10ted that ''it depends on what the costs.are·of the~bids we receive.'' For ex:;tmple, tile cost of improvements on Gads Field, which has priority over work on Library Field, c,ould be so much that no money would be l~ft for any additional work. Renovations of Garis Field;'- targeted for completion in late . August or early September of this year, in 'time for use by fall sports teams·, include the following: regfadation; removal of the old top soil and its replacement, sodding· and installation of a new sprinkler system. If renovations begin on schedule in the spring, the ~ite of the men's lacrosse · team practice would. have to . be shifted•-p.robably to Daley Field, according to Sakata. However, the .work Would not affect the fieJ~'s fall tenant, ~}}e. women's field hockey team. The varsity soccer team woul4 also play some of its gam¢s there, as was intended in the original athletic field reconstructiQn. plan ( see Concordiensis, April 26' 1978), Explaining why the soccer team will only play on Garis Field when weather conditions are good, while remai.ilingJ on Daley Field for foul weather starts, Sakala said that \we don't want to tear tlP Garis again, Its use Will, be controlled so that~ the ·playing field's condition remains good.'' Presently, the condition ~of Daley Field, where· the· soccer team .has played all oUts home games through this season, is so poor that·players' injury risk is sign;iftca-ntly increased. This consideration alinost forced the sit'e-of last fail's NCAA pla~off · ga·me, on Nov.· 1r ag:;tinst Glassboro State College, to be shifted. That contest was allowed to take place here. But Sakala ad~ed that \the NCAA rulmg body told us no fw;ther playoff games can be played on Oaley until its conditionJs improved.\ If,. after money is allocated for revamping Daley Field, enough is still available for ·work on Library Field,.the bulk of reconstruction there . will begin after commencement, allowing t_he field to play its traditional role as the. site · of most · of that event's -ceremonies. Plans c~ for Libr~ry Field to be graded .aqd seeded. In ad· dition, its storm drainage will be inilproved. However, Sakala. noted 'that tfiis pl~rr ~ 'pres:e:nts some _ ... > • - ~ problems.'' Most important, Libr~:try Field would be put out of service next fall. That' would mean varsity football practice would have. to be relocated- most likely on Alexander Field. Club rugby, :games, which also take place there, would also have to be moved. ''We're going to have to proceed with· caution on renovation of Library Field,'' Sa~ala said .. The most imp.ortant con- sideration about the present plans, which only call for the refurbishing of some of Union's outdoor - athletic facilities, i~ tha~ 'it is \just a first step,'' according to Sakala. ·''I'm encouraged,'' he said. ''':l;'he $200;00(1 allocation ~Y the Board of Ttustee.s · at their meeting in January shQWS that they realize a pr-oblem exists: Our ~sports fa.cilities .must be updated.\ , · But refurbishing Garis and. Library Fields ''doesn't really solve any problems. They would be in better shape, but the . burden of use woUld just be shifted to Daley and Alex~nde.r Fields, which aren't in · any better· condition.'' / Discussing project funding,· \. Robert B. Rasmussen, vice president for College resources, agreed that . the Board of Trustees had felt a \sense pf ~urgency\ about the condition of . Union's sports facilities. , \We'll be alert for funding . Qpportunities,\ he said about fi'na_ncing the project. \But this won't divert resources from - regular ~oUtbes, like the anpual ftir.id ·or-the. endowment!',, ,_. ·~ . programs offer students the opportunities to travel and to study- ~~FJ>~d in ~a , munbe~ of coun~nes. The vanous programs co\tel:- a wide spec- · trum and offer a variety of courses. They also cater to a mixture of experience. While some programs require more extensive knowledge of a foreign la.nguage than others, most have requirements that can be satisfied in one or two terms (the. term in England has no language requirement}. Governance Report Released The programs are open to all students, regardless to class or major. Students who are ac- cepted may take as many terms abroad as they like, as long as it fits with the individual's course requirements here at Union. All of the classes offered in ·the program carry liberal learning credit, and all finan- cial aid, including Regents Scholarships, applies. The total cost of the program, including air fare, is comparable to a tenn at tLnion. Professor William Hendricks, chairman of the term abroad program, calls it \one of the best programs .that the college offers.'' Approximately 200-250 students take advantage of the various programs yearly. Next year, the college will qe offering eight programs, as follows: Fall term in Bath, England, with Prof. William M. Murphy; FlQr~nce, Italy With Prof. Ruth Stevenson; and Rennes, France, with Prof. Allen Roberts. Winter term (1980) in Athens, Greece, with Prof. Peter Heinegg; Seville, Spain, with Prof. Judith Ginsberg; and Israel with Prof. Stephen Berk: Spring term will be in Austria under the direction of Prof. Hans Freund. There will also be a program in the summer of 1979, offering the study of socialized medicine in three, countries, with Prof. Robert Baker~ ~ In past years, application for these programs has been on a rolling basis, with students- applying the term before the program took place. This year, however, the method of ap- plying is changing. Students will applf for · all terms abroad offered for 1979-80 at one time. This will be done on Continued from page 1 recommendations to some larger body for discussion and revision; they have final jurisdiction, as far as gover- nance deHberation is con- cerned. The one exception concerns the relationship between the Academic Affairs Council and the General Faculty. We have proposed that any formal policy recommendation made by the Council be subject to the veto o'f the General Faculty if such a vote is requested by at least 10 percent ofthe faculty. We have proposed this -because we think that the General Faculty must re-assume its fundamental responsibility for curricula-r and academic policy. Although · · · we foresee that such a vote will be called for only infrequently, we believe -that such an op- portunity must exist if the faculty is to be held seriously responsible for the quality and orientation of . the academic program at the College. Details of this mechanism are given below. A preliminary word should also be said about the Administrative Affairs Council. Essentially, ·we view the rolp of this Council as making possible the work of the other two Councils. The tasJ®'.of budget- making, maintenance · of buildings and grounds, etc,, are au necessa~y respon§ibilities for tj:J.e implementation ·of programs in the ctirricq~um and in student life. They ~1 -involve making priority deqislons which cut across the entire institUtion. It is in this area where ad- ministrative participah.or1 in governance must be the greatest and where the Council should report directly to the President. It will be quickly obvious in reading the details of each Council that the responsibilities given to each of the three Councils are extens-iye--and probably beyond the capacity of the time and energy of its participants. Therefore, we are also recommending that each Policy Council be empowered, to create as many sub-units (called council · adj\incts l as necessary to deal with specific issue areas and to staff those adjuncts with individuals not on the parent Council. We 'have alse stipUlated that: (a) .these adjuncts normally be chaired by a member of the parent Council; (b) adjuncts. have responsibility £or submittirig proposals to the C~uncil for deliberation and action but cannot for.m~lly recoJ.l).ll1end policy themselves;· and (c~) all adjuncts expire automatically at the -end of every calendar year (i.e., a sunset clause}. THE PERSONNEL REVIEW BOARDS. Essentially three groups · of individuals are reviewed within the purview of the governance system: _ members- of th~ faculty, students, -and prospective students applying for ad- mission. (It should be noted that the l.\eview of administrators is completely removed from the gov·ernance system in our report.) Accordingly, we bave recollliilended the creation of three separate Boards: the ,Faculty Review Board, Student \Review Board (for Academic Standing and Conduct), and the Admi~siqns Board; Because a .f!lpecial Sub-Committee of the Board of Trustees .is currently reviewing the _ entire ' Admissions !Jrea, we have not, included any recommendations ,.,. . of our own concerning the Admissions B'oard in this preliminazy report. Whf3n the Trustee_ Sub-Committee completes its. work (sometime during ·the Winter .Term), \Ve will then issue a supplement· to this report incorporating our recommendations based on their review.

.... OONOORDIENSIS) Beb.ruary 1, 19i9 Page 5 New Trends: Infirmary Engages P.A. by DONNA CREELEY In response to the nee(i 'for changes in the College's in· Hrmary, Head Nurse and Director of Health Services, Doris Richards; and Dean of Students, Robert Kellett have drafted a proposal to be presented to the Student Life Committee. ~· Dean Kellett . explained that full utilization of the College· health services ~s lower than it s)lould ·be, partially due to the fact that, while 105 hours a week are devoted to nursing, a physician is available less than 15 hours per week. In attaining this increased accessibility, Dean Kellet recognized several possible· methods, but the present draft he feels to be the best, .·as ''it wUl be able to ac- complish our goal-:; while at the same time possibly saving 'US some. money.\ One of the alternatives being ·considered is for one .physician to be supplemented by Nurse Practitioners and Physician's Assistants as well as registered nurses. The doctor will most li:)tely be expected· to be :Boardcertified·or Board eligible in Family Medicine as this will increase the number ·Of cases able to be handled directly by the infirmary. Ifhited on a part· time ba$iS, the physician will be able to continue i11 the field of medicine elsewhere, thus remairiing up-to•date Qn current techniques. Dean K.ellet :fe~ls that this program will meail an increase in convenience for the students as the hours that treatment and - prescription ·will he available will be increased. He · also mentioned that by having only one physician for the staff to answer to may develop an in· creased ·coUeagqeship an.d continuity as well as a .better capability to foll()w up the medical problems of ·the students. · In filling a recently vacated position .among the staff, Ms. Richards began . this progression tuward improved services.

I ' ' This two year program consists of one year of classroom study at Hudson Valley Community College followed by one year at Albany Medical School and a preceptorship.

Page 6 OONCORDIJJJNSIS, February 1~ 1919 art6-. Eric Clapton Still Plu ___________ __ by DOUG SIDVERSTEIN Once again many pe()ple who call themselves knowledgable and informative will say that the Clapton is not the Eric Clapton of old. And, then there are those who will say that E:ric Clapton is back. The case is that he never left and this album supports that fa(!t. Comparing the Clapton of the present to the Clapton of the siXties when he headlined with such groups as the Yard birds, Cream and Blind Faith js really quite Wlfair dqe to the lack of a supporting cast comparable to that of Clapton's preceeding groups. Tnere is the ever pr.esent desparation to re- establish his supremacy as a blues performer and arr un- precedented desire for Eric Clapton to prove to his listeners that be's not burned out or over the hill. ''BacklesS;'doeswhat most of Eric's latest albumshave done, blend the pure blUes sound with a touch of . the severe mellow sound and an added dose of pop and jazz. The band is .sup- portative and its strength lies in backup vocalist Marcy Levy, . who has her own album due out soon. The band adJJ diversities and individUality to many of the · songs which would otherwise be in some parts mWldane and commonplace. As usual, the blues . sound dominates most of the cuts on Two VIewpoints: the disc. There are only a couple of mellow tunes on the album. The .single ''PromiseS'' and the out ''Golden Ring\ are the most eloquent .Songs, on the album and probably t}\e most ap- pealing to the new breed of Clapton listeners who have become attracted to Eric Claptons . soft sounds. \Promise•• does reveal El;\ic''s strained voice in which Clapton tends to swallow his words in parts, or chunks. In ali honesty, onedo.esnot need to understand Clapton's mu$ic, just sit back and .feel ft. The cuts ''Watch out for Lucy\ (Sally's sister) and ''Tell me that you Love Me\ are both perfect examples ·Of\ Clapton 's unprecedented ability to blend contemporary pop tock with sixties blues. ~ver present are those ingeniaus gUitar riffs 11,pon wh.ich Glapton established his earlier fame. Their steady beats and r!tythrrlic harmonies blend to form C()hesive com- positions that are typicai of most of the sangs :~n the album. Unlike many of · Clapton 's albums, this one is designed beautifully and begins and ell_ds on a high note. 'The hard rock . songs, that .is hartl for Clapton, open and cl()s~ tlte album and tie a neat bow for d~Uvery. The cuts ''Walkout intbe Rain\ and ''Tulso Time\ lend exhilaration and vivacity to an already energetic album. And if there are still a few of the staunch blues supporters, the songs ''Roh. It'', sung by Marcy Levy, and \Eai!ly in the M<;>tning'' give the album mc;>re of a. blues image. _ This not just another Clapton album, saying that supports the mistaken theory that Eric Clapton has no d.irecti()n of desire. This albUIIl forms a preci$e bridge· between tbe popular music of today with-the mellow and blues expertise of Eric Clapton. The ability to unite different styles of musjc and incorporate toem in an · album. of memorable and en- joyable songs is what .separates Clapton from the pac~. Jl:ric ClaptQn continues to be blues· steady 'rollin' man. Top Ten Hits Of 1978 Pure Bob Blake Picks ... In compiling this list of what I think are the top ten albums of 19781 feel a little opening note is necessary. First I know that my musical taste runs a bit left of center, so someone is bound to say; ''Well why c:lidn't Bruce Springsteen or Chicago make tbe list?'' All I have to say to that is I personally don't like Bruce Springsteen or Chicago, and besides this is my list and not yours, so you can just bug off. Second I know that mY infamous roommate, the arts editor, wanted me to list these in a one to ten preferencial order, but I think these are all fine albums, so I've listed them alphabetically, which means you can bug off too, Steve. 1. Alive on Arrival-steve Forbert: Along with the Roche Sisters and George Gerdes, Steve · Forbert is considered to be one of the top artists of the New York folk scene. This first albmn shows his music to be faithful to the traditional folk idiom with lyrics that are perfectly balanced between the serious and the satirical. It is touching and abounding with charm. 2. Cheap Trick at Bud«~kan­ Cheap Trick: This is one of those wildly -expensive live Japanese import albums that CBS-SONY puts out. If you have not yet heard of Cheap Trick they are best described as \power pap\ and are a band of many influences with something for everyone. It has been said that they are at their best live, and this album amply demonstrates that statement. 3. David Jobansen··David Johansen: This is the premier albwn by the former lead singer of the New York Dolls. My only complaint is that the production tends to obscure the melodies, but it is still a great rock album. 4. Dire Straits-Dire Straits: Yet another debut album on the list from a band that is growing in popularity daily. I'm glad to see that there is still a market for tasteful and intelligently restrained music. 5. Misfits-The Kinks: This· is possibly the best studio album of their career. Ray Davies is in top composmg form with the title track and \Rock and Roll Fantasy\ being among the best songs he has ever written. 6. More S'ongs About Buildings and Food--Talking Heads: Producer Brian Eno has brought out the best in this band. The album is extremely witty, creative, full of drive, and totally Wlique in its sound. I will be very impressed if their next album can equal the quality of this one. 7. Pure Pop For Now People- Nick Lowe: Here is a title that describes exactly what the album is; pure, funny, unadulterated pop. There is not a bad song on this album, I also owe the nick-name Pure Bob to this album, but that is another story. 8, Some-- Girl~-The Rolling Stones: I had long ago written off the Rolling Stones as a band that fame and fortune had spoiled. I never thought they would be able to come up with an album as creative and warm - in feeling as this one again. It ranks among their very best efforts. 9. Street Hassle--Lou Reed: Avant-garde, honest, ugly, breathtaking, immensely pravocative, and throughly haunting, this is a totally un· commerciaL L.P. only for those who are open minded enough to listen to it and give it the time it deserves. Reed uses the avant· _garde elements of his former band the Velvet Underground to explore themes of escape, alienation, and emotional frustration. I believe hindsight will show it to be his best and most· important. work. 10. This Years Model-Elvis Costello: A far more bitter album than My Aim is True, is imagery is often odd, yet amusing. Who .else would ex· plore sexual frustration by writing a song called ''Pump it Up;' about getting unneeded erections? Nick Lowe: Top Popper Orie,ntation Com-mittee A I . . . pp 1cat1ons Applications for the 1979 Orientation Committee will be available from Joe Zeiner in the .

Nevertheless, I still contend that thiS is the best, most painstakingly made rock and roll being presented to the public today; and that it is the victim of gross misperception by the record buyers. Those who enjoyed Delta Chi's Punk Rock party this past Saturday Will have to agree that (>nee one is prepared to accept this stuff, pleasure inevitably ensijes. So, for all hardened cynics and mellow fellows of this campus, read on and be incensed. 1. The Clash: Give 'Em Enough Rope. 'I'hrashabout rock done with flair and in- . tegrity. A sonic treat for those in far an honest, raucous work. 2~ Elvis Costello: This Year 1 s Model. Last year's . record suggested greatne!>§.. :this year's record proves it. Sixties in- nocence meets :seventies in- sensibility to pr.oduce pop masterwork. 3. Nick Lowe: . Pure Pop For Now People. ThE catchiest record in history. Bring the ~whole famUy. 4. David Johallsen: David big rocker's world. Unequivocal exuberance, it's hard not -to like thisman or his·milsic. Solid thru and thru: · · , · ,; · · 5. Shoes: Black Vinyl Shoes. Living room recorded refrains that take a bit to set in. Mellifluous from start to finish; three listens and it's yours for .good. -s. Lou Reed: Street Hassle~ The \godfather of pWlk\ gets off his crutches and sizzles once again. Tbetitletrack is never to 'be forgotten .. Dark and deadly, but strangely endearing.· 7. Wire: Chairs Missing. Eni-gmatic melodie~ set . to lyrics of baffling beauty. It's mystique is habit f()rming; Some call it the .Pink Floyd. of prink; in fact it has a style au of its own. 8. Neil YI>Ung: Comes A Time. Aback to folk roots effort that's so pretty to hear. \Motorcycle Mama\ ruins the second s~de; near flawless otherwise . 9. Devo:Are We Not'Men? W-e ~ Are Devol! .

Leonard Ifbnoy has little trouble adapting tQ the role of hwnanoid; and with a minimum of awkwardness he carries off his role as tile de- psyched psychiatrist. In short, the action, as a whole, is neatly played an(! developed as could be expected. Ver:na Lowe reads a part·from \The Robber Bridegroom ... Re-makes of Classic feature films, especially cultish,. sleeper hit like Invasion of the. Body Snatchers, are supposed to be cheap, exploita.tive ven .. tures with all of the originality and integrity left out for the sake .of appealing to a mass audience. How could the scene, where the heroine finally succornbs to sleep . and is . transformed into one of ''them\ whilelying·in the hero'~ aims,.· be recreated? flow coUld this film . effuse the incomparably · hort:ible feeling that one has just watched the Ia~ person on earth turn into a cybernetieally minded pea pod person; and that now this thing wants you to be the same? Never,. in a million years .. That's what I said until I saw tli.e film. . Invasion of the Body Snat- chers, this time around, treats the viewer with a much more despe.rate vision than the original ,Halfway through the action, there appears to be no conceivable way of stopping the invasion of these aliens who use these giant, body forming pods to absorb hliman. beings and turn them into impassionate drones. Three quarters of the way through, one knows there is no hope of defeat. When Mat .. thew Bennell, the San Francisco Health inspector . (expertly portrayed by . Donald Sutherland}, makes Pearl Harbour out of the alienS' seaside pod growing .factory, the result is much like that of an anarchist knocking out one light . Set in the big city, instead of the rural locale of the original, Body Snatchers is. a m~taphor for increasing dehi1J1lanization in modern society and that this aura emanate$ from the urban areas. The messa~e is as. simple as that, and there needs to be little else here or in the film to augment it. The .film offers no ;solutions; and when. •the . Saturday night, packed house audience moaned at the final scene (where the aliens finally get Bernell), it was such action which went beyond mere disappointment. It was a moan which the filmmakers intended to evoke, and it was a moan that was meant to stick with the vieWi!t. The aliens do not have to come from without. On the technical side, there is little to complain about. Director Philip Kaufman keeps the W.D; Richter screenplay moving in a brisk, straight line fashion. There were very few instances where this reviewer found himself disengaged from the proceedings. Donald Sutherland-is one of America's finest a~tor.s today, and there is nothing about his performance in this film to refute that claim; The_ part of Eliz,abeth Driscoll, the girl who shrivels up ill Bennell's arms to emerge from th~ bushes as a very changed woman, is playec! by Brooke Adams with no particular grace or memorableness. Ms. Adams, who is also currently appearing Donald Sutherland portrays a health of the · lbdy Snatcher$.\ · Cabaret News ·~. ·.

Bo(iy Snatchers is currently playing at the Center l and 2 in Colonie, in the rear of ~acy's. by RANDY KLEIN Cabaret is under new leadership that promises to bring new people, new acts, and new ideas _to an age old Union ·College tradition. The reasons for all of these seeming changes are not to make Cabaret any different than it ever was but to get more people involved. In heading up Cabaret, Katie Abrahms and Liz Catalano would like to see more people involved in both the performin~ and production ends of Cabaret. According to Katie, \The Cabaret is an student run and · that's what makes it so great. · Too often though, it's t11e same people aomg all the things.\ On this point, Katie emphasized her concern over getting more ·People involved-specificaUy .underclassmen. \Half of the Freshmem don't go so their friends don't go.\ The resUlt is that mariy freshmen don't go to a Cabaret after Orientation.\ Cabaret is something speci&l at Union and it's a great way to take a break in the week. In order to get more people down to the Cabaret, several specials are in the works. One possibility that was mentioned is bringing back game night on Tuesday nights: Also in the workings is an all-Freshmen Cabaret to be held some time in the Spring tenn. Many underclassmen hesitate to get involved in or perform at Cabaret because it seems too cliquish. Both Katie and Liz are trying to end this image and they invite anyone who wants to become involved in any aspect of Cabaret to \come on do}Vn\ or call them anytime (Katie-. 6511, Liz~837).

FacUlty. , UNITED TECHNOLOGIES The second kind of advice pertains to the operation of the 'governance structure itself. The Steering Group is responsible for advising the President on the status of decision-making machinery. Specifically, we propose that it be responsible for recommendations con· cerning the following issues: (a) which structure should have responsibility when a new issue arises; (b) resolving disputes between two structures when their actions conflict; (c) the creation of ad hoc task forces w)ien an i~sue or problem goes beyond the scope of any existing body (e.g., proposals con· cerning a calendar change). Moreover, we recommend that this Steering Group monitor the course of decision-making once issues have been brought to the attention of various structures to ensure' that action is taken It is important to note that we are also promising that certain minimum qualifications be met by all candidates standing for election to the Councils and Boards. Most importantly, they must agree to serve a full term (unless they are elected specifically to fill a vacancy) and must agree not to take a leave of absence from the College dUring the . term for which they are elected. A faculty member may be elected to only one C-ouncil or Board at any one time and may not be re- elected immediately ~o the same Council or Board. Finally, only regularly elected members may attend meetings of the Councils and Boards as voting members; no ''proxies\ or substitutes will be permitted. With two exceptions; aU studentswill be appointed. to the Councils, Boards an<l ·Con ... sultati()n Groups by the Student Appointments Committee. The two Exceptions are the Student Affairs Council and the StEering Group. Student membersJI!p on the Stndent Affairs Couneil will consist of the President '()f the StudEnt Body, the Trea.surer, ' and tl\e President of the Senior. Junivr, and Sophomore classes (a com}Jlete revision of student will be February 13 ·to interview candidates tor attractive opportunities in HIGH TECHNOLOGY Consult your Placement Office for degree and field of study requirements · with deliberate speed· and ef- ficiency. We envision that the Steering Group might meet briefly (fifteen minutes or so) once or twice a week. ELECTION OF MEM· BERSHIP. In the case of the Policy Councils and the Review Boards, faculty membership will be determined by election by the General Faculty. In two cases, the Academic Affairs Council and the FacUlty Review Board, some specific slots will be reserved for representation by faculty coming from spec,ific Departmental groupings to insure that the concerns of different fields are represen- ted; however,. an positions will be elected by the entire General Faculty. In an other cases, election will be from the facUlty at large. We propose that nominations will be put forward by the Executive Committee of .,the Faculty (see below), .·but We are proposing that the faculty membership on the two Consultation Group&, be as follows:' on the Steering Group, the Chairman of the Faculty and the SecretarY of the Faculty · will represent the faculty so · that careful coordination is possible between the Pres~dent of the College· and faculty leadership; on the Ombudsman Group, two faculty represen- tatives shall be appointed for staggered two-year terms by the Executive Committee of the · government will be propo~ed by the Student Forum so~aetime this tenn). Membership em the Steering Group will consist of the President and Treasmrer. of the Sttulent Body, thus aqding the tv.~ highest student officers to tltE\()fficers of the Fac.Uty in advising the President elf the College about the functior1ing of the governance system.

Hope to see you there! ·Little .Sisters by STEVEN MILES and MIRABELLA CUSMARIU In last week's Concordy, the article pertaining to Little Sisters contained information which we thought may have peen misleading. To clear ·up aqy questions, we would like to explain exactly what our -Little . Sisters program is and how It .functions. ~ The .Phi Sigma Kappa Little Sisters was the first organization ever to formally affiliate a group of women With a Union fraternity. The Little Si~ters are Union College women, .presently munbering seven, who had become ver~ close friends with the Brother~, of Phi Sig an(i wanted tc maintain that close attachment. Together they formed the Phj Sig Little Sisters, an auxillar} gr()up socially integrated with the house. The women are not ritual members, however, and Ppi Sig is in no manner a co-ec. . fraternity. As a group, the Little Sisters. share most of their activitief with the Brothers. Together they hold social fWlctions., fiel{J athletic teams (already they've won one college intramural championship), work for charities and promote frater· nity functions. In addition tcr having social rights and use of · ·the house facilities, many of thE · women also eat meals with th( Brothers. But they also pride ·them- selves on having independence as a gro\lp. They elect their own . Cifficers and are not controlled by the house. They alone decide their activities, functions and duties for the term and then . coordinate them with Phi Sig. · Dues are detennined by the Little Sisters and become part of their own treasury. Finally, the Little Sisters pride them- selves on having their own constitution, bylaws and, most importantly, secret initiation·. ritual. It's taken a long time and !}lot·· of hard w,ork putting the first · Little Sisters group together. But so far it's been a lot of fun and we're excited about the future. · $ociology Dep~. · 1 . Voted Chapter . Union's sociology department has been voted .a chapter~the . Omega Chapter of New Yor~f' Alpha Kappa Delta, the national sociology honor society. Faculty advisor Ilene Kaplan, instructor of sociology, said that the initiation of the first members will take place this spring. In order to be eligible for membership in their junior'- year, sociology majors must maintain a 3.3 grade point 1. average in sociology courses, be in the top 35 per cent of their class, and complete four sociology courses by the end of their junior year winter term. · Seniors are eligible. for membership by meeting s~ilar requirements and b) completing sociology majol requirements by the end of the· senior year. In applymg for membership in Alpha Kappa Delta, the . sociology department had tv . submit information about tht: professional p~fblications and research interests of facult) members, course offerings and requirements for majurs, : numbers of students majoring in Sociology, and special ac· tivities sponsored by the department.

On The Agenda The following item has been placed on the agenda for the .student Forum meeting to be held this Thursday n~ght, Feb. 1 at 9 p.m. in the Hale House Dining Room: Resolution: Resolved that, the Student Forum regards the College's efforts to remove snow and ice from the campus's roads, sidewalks, and parking· lots this winter term as grossly inadequate. The Student Forum calls on the administration of this College to remedy this incompetence immediately and to see to it that the perilous conditions which have prevailed for a good part of this term will be absent in the weeks to come. Rationale: We believe this College, and in particular the Maintenance Department, has been grossly negligent in the Clearing of snow and ice from the campus's walkways and driveways. It is true that the inclement weather which has prevailed throughout much of this term can be termed an \act of God\ but we believe the College's efforts to improve the conditions on campus following these storms were just plain ineffective. Unsafe conditions have lingered too long. Sponsors: Steve Richards, Brien O'Toole, Mark Burnett, Lisa Katz, Murray Levison. Presents JEFF AMATO and · Karen- You oughtto be havin' Deb P.

Students in the Preceptorial are given a reading list which covers a broad range of topics, frotn politics to math. Students are eiq>ected to read, discuss and write papers on these books.

After each paper, the individual students have conferences with their Last Thursday,,Feb. 1, during a closed session of the student . forum, the student holding the dual position of Vice President of the Student Forum and Chairman of the Committee ·on Committees, rdr.

Having been elected last year for the post, the tenn ()f which is designated as th.e academic year 1978-79, Felc:bnan now feels that he must resign for a variety of reasons~ Concordiensis, in an. effort to present fairly Feld- man's views, rrqllested that he include in this article a letter explaining his decision, a letter which he otherwise would have submitted to the paper as ··a letter to the editor. Feldman both willingly a11d guaciously acceded to this request. preceptors to discuss their .papers, and then often rewrite Dear Students: them. :- Not only are students offer.ed a broad e:x:perience through the reading material, but through their preceptors. Contrary to what most expect, only two of the professors in the program are from the English depart- ment. Professors from the History, Philosophy; Math, Biology, Chemistry. and Modern Languages depart- ments in addition to the English department make up the program's staff. Students see professors involved in areas other than those of their ex- pertJse and are themselves encouraged to dabble in a variety .of fields. other than their major. - In a student evaluation of last term's Preceptorial, response \ This is a very difficult letter to begin; I know, because I have been trying to do so for weeks now. I am re~igning from my dual positions of Vice President of the Student Forum and Chairperson of the Committee on Committees.. I ha:\re been contemplating this decision for quite some time now. It is a major decision ill my life, and yet a simple one, for I know that I am doing what 1 feel is right. At the risk .of being accused of psychological reductiorii~, I feel that people nun for off1ce to satisfy personal psychological needs. Of course, the intentions of most people,. including my own, for getting involved in student goverlllnellt were to attempt to imprr.ve the quality of life for students. However, I must admit. to you and myself that the underlying motivations for myself, and perhaps others to a greater or lesser degree, who run for office, ts to fulfill psychological needs. This is not necessarily bad; in many cases politics is a h~althy outlet for fulfilling these needs, and at the same time, their participation can lead to an improvement of student life. I speculate though, that since elected officials may not understand their motivations; once they have become imbued in the gover- , ning process, they tend to forget the very intentions they may have believ-ed spurred them to initially run. What has become apparent to me is that my overemphasis and subsequent over~ involvement in student government rio longer fulfills my personal needs. As ·a con- sequence of this realization. I now know that I 'must achieve my .potential in another area, academics, to . be better satisfied and take a step Closer to personal fulfillment. If-.is of no coincidence-,. then, that I now enjoy my classes and find them much more interesting · than ever before. Moreover, I now find student government capturing less of my attention and interest. For these reasons, I choos.e to resign from office. I have en- joyed student government and am grateful, for it has helped me fulfill my perceived needs. ~· Hence, I hope nobody interprets Q this letter as \a shot'' at st~de!lt i · government or the people ,m It, for this is not its intention. The reat'benefit I have gained from student government in· volvement at Union has not been the acquisition of knowledge concerning government functioning, but rather the insights into myself that I have gained. Perhaps I could learn more about myself by staying on in office, but I cannot do so for the following reasons. First and most importantly, it would not fulfill my personal needs and, conseq.uently, could never provide me with a feeling of ultimate satisfaction. Secondly, I .feel I can learn much more about the world and myself by experiencing other aspects of life. I feel thc(lt I have given much to student govern- ment, .and it in turn has given much to me. Nevertheless, I now know that I no longer have the motivation or need for student government and, therefore, feel it is the ap· propriate time to leave. I do not want to linger on, as this would be unfair to myself, my colleagues, and to the people Continued on page 4 Former Student Forum Vice President Randy Feldman. -- '

All of us have had the same experience as fresh· men. We attempt to talk to an attractive girl (or even a not so attractive one) and before you _can even begin to cut through the \superficial conversation\ she brushes you off. After the tenth time that happens (or the fifteenth or twentieth) you begin to lose some confidence and your d.esire to try. I'm not speaking only from personal exJ)erience. Every Union male I know bas experienced the same thing. Why do the girls brush us off? Perhaps it's insecurity, but I think it helps to know that in a few minutes a more desirable male might eome by to talk, since there are so many more of us around. The-ratio takes away the edge that most males are used to having. Here the girls have the edge. At Skidmore, Union males can retain that edge. If ·you think that everyone who goes to Skidmore gets easy sex you are mistaken. ·However, they can receive the attention they do not receive at home. Still I think Skidmore i3 a cop out by the men~ a good reason not to try for love and sex at Union • (uneven ratio, serious at- titudes). . To remedy tbe situation is difficult. The men are finally turned off after being turned away so often,.and the women are too shy or stuck up to help heal our wounded egos. I think asking for boldness only on tbe part ()f the men is not fair. The women need to be bold, and show us that they are truly interested. Believe it or not, some of us men have opened up and been crushed. Union women can open up just as easilY. as we can. I tend to think, though, that many are satisfied wiUJ the attention they receive now and see no need to change their \attitudes.\ However, you two are ex- ceptions to the rule. You're attractive, vivacious, and ready for action. I too am attractive, vivacious, and as modest as you are. So if you'r~ looking to share your \experience I'm ready to $hare mine. But in typical Union co-ed fashion, you left without leaVing your names. That's all right, I'll leave mine. Bruce Shennan Classof'81 I believe the basic problem p lies nmt with Union men or . USSycafS women. but with them both. Both sexes are too uptight for mueh to really happen here. The fact is Union College is serious business and that at· titude flows over into the social arena. It is hard for both men and women to find easual sex at Union, because everyone takes every thing, including relationships, so seriously. OutBid~ of the college is dif- ferent because that is not where your life is, and it is easier to relax. That is why many men go to Skidmore and you went wherev-er you. found your men. A more easy going attitude is needed, but it is not easy at a sellloOl where is so The BrothErs of D. U. would like to thank all those \BOlD people for making our party a huge success.

Animals To Union College Males- specifically those of you who attended Delta Upsilon's \B( Bold\ party. c-o the Editors Concordkmsis. Hi. We were there Saturday night. We saw you. We wert invited to the party on the premise that we should be open, friendly-bring our \lofty noses out of the air.\ We did just that We went into the fraternity anticipating meeting \new friendsn. and possibly finding someone with whom we could fonn a meaningful relationship. Instead, what we found was the typical Union male-the animal that the &riginal \Be Bold\ girls complained about. The party was a meat market -in its traditional sense. Most of you guys who initiated conversation with us did so only with the hope that it would land you between the sheets .of one of Union's eds. Of course, we prefer that approach to the others you used- pinching, grabbing, sneering, and being crass and rude. Y know=:-if we complied with wishes, at the very next party you'd be in a corner with your friends pointing us out as \easy marks\ girls that no nice guy would take anywhere but bed. Why don't you just cut out the pick-up trappings and be yourselves. We aren't prudes, we just don •t like the games. We aren't into marriage cer- tificates either-we're out for good time, just like )'OU are. Only, we have a little class. At the next party, instead Union Views:. Hockey by Jim Davis - The red light flashed on and the cro.wd, in enthusiastic acknowledgement, rose to its feet, applauding. With less than a minute to play in the second period of last Friday night's hockey game against Colby, senior defen~ · seman Mike O'Connell found the net with a goal that tied the contest at 1-1. And; for that moment at least, Achilles Rink resounded with cheering every bit as con- centrated and Wlrestrained as during the contests of just a few years ago. Maybe the present Union squad iS a couple of years away from any championships. But that doesn't mean that the brand of hocke~ they play isn't every bit as exciting as Union hockey ever was. , Even before the game began, there was a kind of electricity in . the air. You could. sense that, . whoever won, the game would be a thriller, the kind that keepS fans on the edge. of their seats.

'· ' ~ I j i ' I l ' i I Silent Movie To the Editor: On the evening of Saturday January 27, I paid one oollar and twenty· five cents to witness what for all intents and pur- poses was a silent version of the movie SlapsllBt starring Paul Newman. W'rult 1 anticipated to be an enjoyable evening turned out to be a struggle to decipher what r can only describe as \static emanating from the mouths of all the characters in the film. It was almost as if they were all speaking with mouths stuffed full of cotton. Con¥ sidering that t}lis is far from the firsJ; time that I have been exposed to such intolerable conditions for viewing a film at Union I feel that an appeal to the Film Committee is in order. What good is a schedule of · really excellent films for Winter Term if it is impossible to follow the soWldtracks? Part of the problem may be attdbuted to what appears to be out-dated equipment. However~ I think that another more im- portant part to tl)is problem is a defmite display ()f apathy on the parts of the members of the committee who are present at the shows. About forty~five minutes of the movie had gone by last Saturday night when the inaudible sound turned into very audible silence. After about five minutes of lip reading under the assumption the person in charge of the film was correcting the problem I left my seat to find out what the problem was. When I opened the door to _the projection rOC>m l found two people engrossed in con- versation having nothing .to do with the problem at hand~ Needless to say it came as a complete surprise to these people that the audience had been watching a movie without sound .f()r the last five minutes.

System Dear Editors, In light of the misun- derstandings that have arisen regarding tbe new plus-minus grading system, I would like to make the following clarifications: 1. When The All-College Senate approved the new plus- minus grading system last year, it was intended that the use of plusses and minuses would be optional. That is, just as it bas always been left to the discretion of a faculty member to use (or not to use) each specific grade (say a \DH an \Fu or an \A\), the faculty is under no obligation to use all of the allowable grades in the new system. 2. At its ·January 17, however, l men CQP out? All of us have had the same experience as fresh- men. We attempt to talk to an attractive girl (or even a not SQ attractive one) and before you can even begin to cut through the \superficial conversation\ she brushes you off. After the tenth time that happens (or the fifteenth or t wentiethJ you begin to lose some confidence and your desire to try .. I'm not speaking only from personal experience. Every Union male I know has experienced the same thing. Why do the girls brush us off? Perhaps it's insecurity. but I think it helps to know that in a few minutes a more desirable male might come by to talk, since there are so many more of us around. The ratio takes away the edge that most males are used to having. Here the girls have the edge. At Skidmorei Union males can retain that edge. If you think that everyone who goes to Skidmore gets easy sex ycm are mistaken. However, they can receive the attention they do not receive at home. Still I think Skidmore is a cop out by the men. a good reason not to try for love and sex at Union. (uneven ratio, serious at· titudes). To remedy tl)e situation is difficult. The men are tmally turned off after being turned away so often,.and the women are too shy or stuck up to help heal our wowtded egos. I think asking for boldness only on the part of the men is not fair. The women need to be bold, and show u.s that they are truly interested. Believe it or not, some of us men have opened up and been crushed. UniDn women can open up just as easily as we can. I tend to think, though, that many are satisfied with the attention they receive now and see no need to change their \attitudes.\ However, you two are ex- ceptions to the rule. You're attractive, vivacious, and ready for action. I too am attractive. vivacious, and as modest as you are. So if you•re looking to share your \experience I'm ready to share mine. But in typi~al Union ro-ed fashion, you left without leaving your names. That's all right, I'll leave mine.

Hockey by Jim Davis · The red light flashed on and the crowd, in enthusiastic acknowledgement, rose to its feet, applauding. With less than a minute to play in the second period of last Friday night's hockey game against Colby, senior defen· seman Mike O'Connell f01md the net with a goal that tied the contest at 1·1. And, for that moment at least, Achilles Rink resoWlded with cheering every bit as con- centrated and unrestrained as during the contests of just a few years ago. Maybe the present Union squad is a couple of years away from any championships. But that doesn't mean that the brand of hockey they play isn't every bit as exciting as Union hockey ever was. , Even before the game began, there was a kind of electricity in the air. You could sense that, whoever won, the game would be a thriller, the kind that keeps fans on the edge of their seats. One of the spectators sitting behind me was Jan Ludwig, a philosophy professor here. He's a knowledgable hockey fan, appropriately enthusiastic and angry, as the situation dictates. He had a lot to say as the action progressed from end to end. One of his comments was particularly memorable. At one point he observed, after a missed pass or some similarly sloopy play, that ''this sure isn't the kind of hockey the Bruins play.\ He said it disappointedly, after the Dutchmen had missed a scoring opportunity.

The Dutchmen may not be facing off against national powerhouses, but they're playing some quality teams and are making quite a respectable showing for themselves.

Page 4 Sowa ·Heads Committee on Student Life ·~ byDEBBE DAMRELL and MATT NAGORSKY As part of its accreditation process, the College has set up several self-study committees .. One such group, chaired by Prof. John Sowa of the Chemistry department,. is considering Student Life and Student Affairs. The ultimate goal of this committee is to draft a report; describing the state of student life and student affairs at Union, both now and what it is hoped to be in the future, as well as possible suggestions to attain these goals. The committee is not considering purely academic issues such as course selection, the liberal learning program, etc., as these will be discussed by other groups: Since its · foi:'mation in late November; the committee has met with a diverse group of people, including students, faculty, administrators, sta£f and clergy. Topics of discussion nave included the followin~: College traditions; student morale--attitude and per- ceptions; fraternity-sorority- independent· relationships; the effect of faculty attitude on · student morale; the role -of the Resident Advisor;· the influence of the many preprofessional--- career-oriented students on campus life; the College Cen- ter; ·the food service, health service, counselling center, maintenance, housing and security offices; and specific problems and situations faced by minority students at Union. As a result of these discussions, many perceptions have surfaced repeatedly. First and foremost, Union is basically agoodplace, though not without its problems. -It is believed that life here could be improved if students had more pride in the College; its traditions and themselves. In addition, new facilities and the expenditure of vast sums of money would aid in improving the quality of student life.

Feldman goes on to say that \what's wrong with education heve is a lack in the amount of learning that students get from each other, via discussions -of pro b 1 em s , em ot i o n s , philosophy, thought.'' Noting the decline into virtual oblivion of the intellectual cabaret in particular, Feldman says that \the intellectual activity here is minimal.''

The exhibition, •;•American Art Works on Paper\ is composed of artwork by Elbert Weinberg, Charles Steckler, Arnold Bittleman, and Nina Rosenblwn LeClerk. Elbert Weinberg's portion of the exhibition includes not only drawings, out also scUlpture. As he says, \In the process of making my sculpture, drawing has played a secondary role in the nature of tool.\ Indeed, one of his drawings appears elsewhere in the eXhibit as the sculpture \Maria !\. Many of his drawings appear to be preliminary sketches for sculptures, and few of his drawings are very formally done. One of my favorite works by him was \Bird Studies\ a collection of sketches done with a ballpoint pen. Charles Steckler also took a casual approach to many of his draWings. In fact, most of his exhibit consisted of carbon copies of his notebooks. Steckler'~ art ranges from a humorous spell of \Not- tomania\ to stage designs. His ''Nottomania'' consists of sketches of various items based on the Nott Memorial; Nott beer mugs, biki~is, earrings and other imaginative ideas. Some pastel drawings of bizarre masks and costumes are also included . with ··His work. Steckler's portion of the exhibition is certainly the most varied of the fQur sections, with even a design for a sink shelf on the pages of his notebook. Positioned between Steckler's and Weinberg's portions of the exhibition is the art of Arnold Bittleman. · The highlight of Bittleman's section is the Owlkill series, consisting of pastel and charcoal works. There are four items in this series, and each of them is a l~e canvas which, as he says, • • • • . .

Her portrain of i the \Jazz Si11ger\ was a per- : sonal favorite of the eXhibition. i Her dra\01\limgs · are mainly ! portraits tllat capture not only ! the visual image of the subject, : but alSo tlae subject's emotion.

Following this event the iced' obstacle course event will be held at 2:45p.m. Each team will be allowed one entry and the winner will be chosen on the basis of completing the course Almost every student at Union has had the experienc~ of rushing to the bookstore after \ the first day of class to fight With classmates over a 11Iilited · nwnber ·of available books. Another frustration for professors as well as students is the bookstore's inability to st<l\Ck1i required book. in the fastest time. Akeg :of beer and additionnal POints will be awarded to the team with the most rowdy and original cheers. As a part of the Friday festivities the Social Committee will co-sponsor a traditional Friday evening Coffeehouse. It will begm at 7 :30 in the Old Chapel.· A new event has also been added to this year's schedule of events. The Black Student Alliance is sponsoring a disco fashion show in con- juncti(m with are~ merchants, The show is slated to begin at 7 p.m. in Memorial Chapel. Admission is $3.{10 and a disco party will follow immediately after the show starting ap- proximately at 10:30 p.m . For .those who don't like disco and find. some good ole coUntry music ·is their thing, Friday c night holds a special treat. ~· Banjo Dan and the Midnight a. Cowboys will feature .foot- i stomping music in the Pub from l; 10:00' p.m. to closing. Come out 11 and enjoy a type of en- ~ tertainment unfamiliar to the if typicaLUnion student! Holley Greene, manager of Union;s Book Store, says the open registration at Union makes it alinost impossible to supply ·an accurate number of bo_o~s. In some courses there _,' >-- ' has been up to a forty percent change in enrollment from pre- registration to registration. · In addition many students acquire used books or, if a course requires several books, may share them to save ex- pense . The bookstore uses· past average purchases as well as pre-registration lists tQ estimate the ntimber .of books needed for a course . Books are usually ordered five weeks in .advance. Additional books, ordered as needed, take four or five working days to reorder. Overstocking is not a prac- tical answer to book shortages. ' In most. cases only twenty percent of an order can be returned. This involves ship- ping and handling costs. Storing leftover books fot future use is . also costly and ties up bookstore funds and space. This is usually because there .are cases where books are not available at aU due to the fact that the professor placed his order too late or the publisher ran out of stock. The latter happen~d this term when an ordered book was not available because it was being revised. - ' ' . ......._ ~- Occasionally, a desired book is out of print. A few used copies of the book were obtained but the condition of the books was poor and students had to share them. As one student put it.. \In an already competitive at- mosph~re like Union not .being able to locate a book only makes me more uptight.'' Book. shortages are an in· convenience to professors as well. In planning a course most professors hope to combine classic . works on the .subject with recent writings. Infor- mation on the availability of hard-to-find old or new works is unreliable . Publishers usually carry large stocks of big-selling texts often used in lar:ge university courses. As a small school, Union aims to provide more specialized sophisticated works; because th~re is little market for this type of work stocks are often low . When a professor finds out at the last minute a book be was depending on is unobtainable there is not much he can do . _ Hasty adjustments in often months of planning must be made . In this case the professor and students must make do with xeroxed copies of text readings and additional outside reserve reading materials . The fun continues into Saturday where the first event of the. day Will be the cross country ski race. Each team will be allowed to have one ~ember compete and the event 1s slated to begin at noon . Rolley Greene, manager of the Bookstore, comments on recent problems • Though the library has been very helpful a xeroxed reserve can not replace an individually owned copy of a book. and a viable solution to the problem of book shortages is becoming a growing concern as the new term approache~.

Any student who wants more information about the two courses can contact Prof. J. Board or Prof. S. Berk .. In addition, a series of public lectures is tentatively planned. Details will be announced later. Since 1965, Vatikiotis·has been Professor of Politics. with reference to the Near and Middle East at the. University of London. He has been visiting professor and iecturer at a number of universities and institutions, including The Johns Hopkin·s University, American University in Cairo, University of. Michigan, University . Qf California, llarvard, Stanford, Penn- sylvania and Toronto. In 1973-74 he was distinguished visiting professor. and visiting senior fellow of the Council on the Humanities, Princeton University. Last year he was academic director of the Center for Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Studies in Athens, Greece. He has won a nlUllber of fellowships,· including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1961- 62. .Scqnning Device A new addition to the Science and Engineering Center is a scanning electron microscope. The microscope is the property of Dudley Observatory who will share operating costs with the College. The scanning electron microscope has the potential to examine a surface area which is 200,000 times smaller than what may -be seen by the con- ventional microscope. It also features a special X-ray dispersive unit which will allow · , one to zero in on a specific area and read out concentrations of elements in this area. Army Reserve Featuring the backbone of the unit, a heavy equipment grader, dwnp truck and rough terrain crane, the 464th Engineer Battalion, US Army Reserve, will host an ''Open House\ on Saturday, February 17. The . event will be held at the · Sergeant Horace D. Brandt United States Army Reserve . Center, 1201 UiHside Ave., Schenectady, from noon until 3 p.m. Other displays will h~ghlight coiill1lunications equipment, maintenance and Shop facilities and individual equipment and uniforms. ''We want the 'Open House' to show our neighbors What the Reserve program · is about,'' said Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) John S. Jones, Battalion Commander. \Currently. our unit has openings for women and men With or without prior military service.\ . Job training available through the Reserve program varies from heavy equipment construction positions to skilled construction and clerical vocations. \Our 'Open House' is a family affair and refreshments will be served throughou~' the af~ ternoon,\ LTC Jones added. Women and men witho11t prior military service, ages 17 to 34, may enlist-in the Reserves for six years. The only age restriction .of prior service applicants is that they must be able to complete 20 years of service by age 60. For high school seniors, college students and seasonal workers, the split trainin-g, option is available. Under this .program tlte enlistee- can take basic training, return to school or job, and complete advanced individual training at a later time. Grcint~To . . . Wier Prof. P .J. Vatikiotis, con- sidered to be one of the English- speaking world's most eminent authorities on .Middle East politics, will serve as visiting professor of history and politics at Uni()ll College this spring. The scanning microscope · works by recording the 'angles Larry M. Wier, visiting assistant professor of chemistry }tere has been aw~rded a $10,000 grant from the Petroleum Research Fund of the American Chemical Society. Vatikiotis will teach two courses. One is \Modern History ofthe Middle East\ (PS 187), which will examine problems in the political, social, :md economic history of the Middle East in modern times. The other course is a seminar on \Contemporary Politics of the Middle East\ (PS 149), . and directions of electrons . bouncing off the surface of a sample. Tllis information is collected and a .picture is for- med of the surface charac- teristics of the item being · Studied. · Use of the scanning electron microscope will be limited to Dudley Observatory staff and the Union faculty.

Page 11 Swimmers SwluDped the Norwich mentor, as Union _prevailed 61-50 .. In a series of masterful strategk moves, Coach Magee utilized his swimmers to the fullest, which completely bafned the Norwich coach. Even ·~ disputed disqualification of Phil Heubner did not daunt the Union mentor. Assured of Ms swimmers' abilities, he calmly watched them pick apart the Norwich squad. The Garnet natators took alm.ost every ,first, and often swept events by placing first and second. J. V. HQopers Even Record by DAN MARCUS . Although Union's Swimming team is only .2-4, this record is hardly indicative of how the. team has performed. Faced with a difficult schedule and forced to use a decadent .pool,. the Dutchmen mermen have sparkled time and time again. Most recently, the Dutchmen have boWed to a .poWerful Trinity squad, 70-38, were edged · out. by Kings Point 61-43., and then blew away Norwich 61..00. In each of these meets, the Garnet natators turned in ex- cellent times; i;tnd in many cases are coming dose to breald.ng school records. . The clash against the Trinity Bantams in Hartford on January 24 was highlighted by the stellar performance of Capt;:~.in Doug Richardson; freshman sensation Chris Meyer, and veteran natator Mark Peronto. Brightening an otherwise bleak day, these Skiers Sixth· by ALLAN MOLHO To the surprise of everyone .except to the team themselves, the Union Ski Team finished 6th out -of 15 teams in the Alfred- SUNY Buffalo Meet this past weekend. Union competed against teams from ex- ceptionally large schools, with varsity status and extravagant budgets, such as Cornell, Buffalo, Clarkson, Colgate, and Army. · Fred Thimm ffuished first (1:06.9) in the grueling giant slll.lom, .faster than his rival from Cornell, Steve Blauvelt. Freshman Eugene Kliot finished 12th (1:11.9) in the same event and was also 12th in the _ slalom competition later that day. Other fine per- formances in the ·slalom were turned in by Rich Przysinda (18th) and freshman Brad Kline (21st). Thitnrn and freshman Jeff Ince posted among the top five times after their first run 7 but both caught a gate on their second run. Neither finished and, therefore, could not be counted in the final results. In the cross country event the next day, Ed. Hourstmann, Brad Fisher and Phil Jones all produced excellent efforts against very tough and ex- perienced teams in the 15 km race. Union shined in the 20 m ski- jUmping competition which was the final event of the meet. Eugene Kliot was a very im- pressive sight as he flew through tbe air and outjwnped all other individuals by more than 20 ft. His best jump was 96 ft. and his style was extremely good giving first place for the event. David Johns and Brad Fisher who jumped for their first time, finished among mDre exp.erienced jumpers. With the important ex- perience of their first moot under their belts,theteam looks ahead to the Clarkson meet-with · confidence that they can ·cdn~ tinue to improve and confidence that they can become a force to be respected in the remainder of the season. · three gave the D\ltclunen hope - as they returned to snoWy Schenectady to take on the . Merchant Marines of Kings Pqint. In the last few ye~ts, the · Dutchmen have always had nip and tuck affairs w'ith the sea- toughened cadets. This meet was to be no different. The lead see-sawed hack and forth until tlte .final diving competition. However, the Union team is not blessed with a diver, and therefor.e was forced to give up ten points. Taking this into consideration, it was amazing that the team did so welf. Spartan efforts by Cnris Meyer, _who snagged two firsts, Mark PerQnto, and Wes Jakovic spurred the Dutchmen on in this \ confrontation. J The Union Swimming team is now peaking; Upcoming home meets with traditional rivals H:amilton on February 10 and RPI on February 14 should prove to be tbrillers. However, the team does need your sup- :port. Come on up to the pool flnd watch your swimmers in ac· tic;m! by BILL CURTIN The Union JV basketball team overcame a last minute onslaught by a gutsy Albany State squad to .prevail in their only game last week. The Dutchmen seemed to be in control with a bulky55-40 lead at halftime. Union built tliis lead by playing one of their finest halves of the season. They played very well offensively led by the playmaking and ballhawking of point guard Mike Canning, who made several key plays, and also by the rebounding of Bruce Jakiel. Thi$ was complemented by an agressive defense. The second half was a different story though, as the Dutchmen ap- peared to Jose their poise whUe Albany State regained . their confidence. The Great Danes almost overtook Union but the determined Garnet squad sank some key shots in the closing seconds. Union had a very balanced scoring attack with four players hitting in dDuble figures but were again plagued by foul troubles as three star• ters fouled out. A secon-dvictory was added to the Gamet ledger when the aquamen travelled to Nor- thfield, Vermont, to/ do battle with Norwich University. In an amazing .meetmg of the m-m~.

The second half was dominated by sophomore Dan Koubek who pumped 1n 10 points in the first few minutes enroute to 16 points. for the game. He was 7u10 from the field. Sobocinski added 15 points. The 79 points and 47 rebounds by the Dutchmen were both season bests. In addition, the defense allowed a season low 52 points. It is this kind of performance which will be necessary for Union to remain .competitive the rest of the season. Union still faces formidable foes Hamilton, Rochester (twice), Yale, Hartwick, and Tufts all within 20 days along with three other games in that time span. 'Last night Union faced Division III biggie Hamilton in an away game. Hamilton is once again the Division Ill power in Upper New YorkState with a 13•1 mark as of last weekend.

As well as conducting the ·search for a candidate within the individual depart- ments, outside applications have also been solicited. candidates alon·g with con- sidering department members in order to have a diversity of candidates, and interviewed several candidates· at the Modern Languages Association Convention in New York City. The strongest candidat~ was brought to the campus and had a chance to talk to the various . members of the department immediately considered unacceptable. The two ac- ceptable candidates were a former Union 'structures' professor now teaching at another institution, and a full professor at another universi.ty. However, the former Umon professor is not eager to accept the position, and the other candidate recently . turned the position down. One of the main problems faced by the depart- ment is that professors who already have full tenure at another institution are reluctant to give that up.

The department did advertise outside the College for Money for~ the outside search had not been guaranteed by the administration, however, and when the department was in- formed that it was not available, it was determined that an outside search could not be pursued at this time. According to Prof. Stevenson, there had not ·been a strong consensus on the one candidate who had been brought to the campus, so the decision, although not met with en• Another problem faced in the search is the fact that fewer and fewer engineers are going into teaching, and many of those who do teach are returning to engineering. Teaching salaries can't compete with engineering salaries, so the demand for professors is greater than the supply. None of the professors within the department are eligible at this time for the position of chairperson, so the search must continue in spite of . U.~ .. $h!!J1age_ •. Engin~ering Changes Approved by~,STEVEGlt~L and DES:BED.AMRELL Major changes in Union's engineering curri'Cul~ were passed at last Thursday's All College Senate meeting. · At a mid·October meetiilg ot the Educati()ilal Policy Com- mittee, proposals forwarded by Prof. Edward J. Craig front the Division IV faculty were presented for deliberation as a result of the engineer~ng department's concern over a recent report from the Engineer's Council for Professional · Development (ECPD), the national' ac- crediting }Jod:y for engineering. This evaluation expressed the need for modification of Union's engineering currkulum in order to more closely meet ECPD's requirements. · Since this meeting, the EPC has studied this issue, and has come • iip with the three proposals which were discussed at Thursday's meeting of the ~11 College Senate. _ .Before discussion of the in- dividual proposals ensued, Ptof. Robert V. Wells of Division II offered a substitute proposal which would have instructed the EPC, Dean of Faculty and the facUlty of Division IV to undertake a comprehensive · study of the entire engineering program at Union and to report its findings backtotheSenate in six weeks. It was then brought to the at- tention of the Senate that a study of . the engineering curriculum had in fact already been tackled by the EPC fall term, as outlined in the minutes of EPC meetings, and that an all-encompassing study was not f!ecessary or of immediate concern. The substitute· proposal was voted sown. The· first proposal, although not pertaining eJ~;clusively to Union's engineering depart- ment, ar()se from EPC discussions .of the engineering curriculum. It read as follows: 1. Proposal from the EPC: i. tbat it shall be the general cu.rricular policy of all departments at UniouCollege to Hmit tbe area of concentration required for their inajors, in- · eluding required cognates in other departments; to no more than two-thirds of the to~l course work taken for the ES 03 Higb•Level Language thusiasm, was not challenged. baccalaureate degree; Programming•·The use of The appointment will now ii) that all undergraduates computers in problem-solving definitely be within the l i h h h department. sball be advised to take at east w t emp as is on t e The search for a new chair- one-third of their course work in pro,grantmiug languag.e -. · . disciplines not directly related FORTitAN IV Two hours per personforthe Civil Enginee~mg week. · · • . · · · department, currently chall'ed to~ t~tJ:l~tl!~~~iice:. ef·,.the:· :ES, ... lM'. ~ginemsg--.- ..

A new chairperson should b~ chosen in the near future. The Civil Engineering depart- ment, however, has no firm prospects, and the search may continue indefinitely. At a liberal arts college, even the weightiest major field ·req~iremeilts - should leave at least one-third of a student's course work for application in areas· beyond the field of con· centration. Final Candidates Chosen Prof. Schaeffer of Chemistry stated that part (i) is valid and necessary, but that parts Eli), (iii) and (iv) should. be deleted. His rationale concerning (if) was that advising should be left to the individual advisor, and his reasons for neglecting (iii) and (iv)· were that these tasks are administrative and therefore not necessary for the Senate to legislate. Another Senator stated that part (ii) should be include!{ because it can be v:ie:wed as a statement of an ideal of Union College. A., substitute proposal which only included part (i) was voted d()wn. Subsequently a propOsal by Steve Richards deleting parts (iii) and (iv) was . then passed with a minimal amom1t ·Of discussion. The second proposal, per- taining to course changes in the engineering curriculum, read as follows: 2. Proposal from the ~!::PC: that the engineering depal't· ments be permitted to sub- stitute their proposed half·Unit courses ES 02, ES 03 and ES 04, in appropriate combinations of two, for ES 14 or ES 16, which both would in turn be dropped.

• t Editorials Majors and Minors It has recently been proposed to the Educational Policy Committee that Union adopt an educational sy.stem requiring a student to cGmplete a minor in addition to a major. (see artlcle on Page3.) The system as presented increases the req ui:rements for .graduation by roughl:y four courses (this results from having to take a minor--about six courses--two of which could fulfill Liberal Learning requirements). The major rationale behind this proposal is to require students to take upper level eotuses outside of their major. It is obvious that, for the most part, the Liberal Learning program does not fulfill this goal. Too many times, Liberal Leamtng requirements are satisfied by \gut\ courses, courses not open to departmental majors, or lrttroductocy courses. This change is in line with a general nationwide movement to have more restrictions on academic programs. Although many people are opposed to this, it is important to realize that times have changed drastically since the 60's when educational requirements were reduced. It is no longer the case that the average Union student is here to maximize his education but rather is here to maximize grades. This is not necessarily a conscious effort and is probably denied by many., but at some point virtually all students have participated in this practice. The minor will force students to take a somewhat indepth look into another field; sorlnething that is not don~ now and often regretted when it is too late. Utmost, if is· important to · reme:rn.ber that this -proposal is subject to change. In fact, the EPC ac- tively solicits constructive criticism on this issue specifically, as well as any other issue affecting educational policy. New Elections I This coming week, the Student Government of Union College will accept names in nomination for the position of Vice President of the Student J.i'orum, and thus will attempt to fill the gap now existing resultant from the resignation of Randy Feldman. We urge the student community to ·express true interest in the coming eiection together with its preliminary campaign. Though many within the College community are cynical of the student governing body, the position of Vice President, in many respects, more important in its function ~n either the President of the Forum or th~ student representatives on the Board of Trustees. The Vice President, in perhaps his major role, serves as the Chairman of the Committee on Committees, the body is charged with the duty of appointing studC:mt members to the College standing committees. To that extent, the .office of Vice President is one of the most -powerful positions available to a student at Union. This spririg, the Committee will begin the long; yet . essential process of sb&ping the student government for next year. We hope that, by the end of this week, the Forum will have in its possession, a long list.of capable and sincerely interested students vying for the position.

Big Jack slapped his friend heartily on the back \Ah c'rnon Pete. Slush monster? Hundred feet tall?\ The others at the table laughed, continuing to drink Angelo's finest ale (purportedly brewed in the Black Forest several hundred years ago, but in fact processed and packaged in Oswego), intermittently ex- pressing their disbelief with loud belches and snatches of rugby songs. \Look Pete continued, \it's a huge sucker and it's headed towards North College.\ Big Jack threw his beer down, and wiped a greasy sleeve acrQss his mouth. \Look if you want us to check it out, we will, but it seems kinda dubious-\ \Please snuffled Pete, sobbing audibly, his breath now coming in ragged gasps, his eyes puffy and streaked. \I'm scared to go by myself.\ \Okay guys, let's check it out,\ ordered Big Jack, putting his Security coat and hat on. \Someone call Cliff and tell him we've got an intruder spotted by Officer 'fomalli near North, and we're investigating.\ Nobody moved. \I said, somebody call- \ \Could we call him after?\ asked Pete. Big Jack pushed his hat back rakishly, and scrat- ched his chin. \Yeah I guess so. Okay, you guys ready?\ The other officers grunted in unison, each chuckling to themselves what a dope Tomalli was and how dumb he'd feel when they found nothing and Big Jack made him write up a report anyhow and how mad Cliff would be when he found out what a dope Tomalli was. The grey patrol car inched around the turn at North College, its four eccupants pale and grim in the pale yellow searchlight. \Hey watch it Tomalli!\ bellowed Big Jack, \you almost hit that snowbank! \ \What the hell's a snowbank doing in the middle of the road any . . . uh oh,'' whispered Big Jack hoarsely as he saw just what was attached to that snowbank parked before them, oblivious to their existence. \Slush ... monster,\ moaned Tomalli as he fainted with a kind of liquid ease across the passenger's seat ·and onto Big Jack's lap. The car shot into reverse, scudding across the unsanded ice (\I'll kill those Maintenance bastards,\ Big Jack cursed to himself) into Bronner House, flipping over in the process, and summarily flopping back down again on four wheels. Big Jack, who had taken over the wheel, slammed the transmission into low, spun the car around, and drove the accelerator pedal hard into the floor. The car popped forward with a nauseating lurch, banged into the monster's left foot, crum- pling the front fender and sending the car skittering into a sickly-looking pair of evergreens, spraying brownish needles across the road. \Jack he's gonna step on us,\ whined Officer Starkly, terrified. \I know, I know; just shut up and let's get outta here!\ When the car passed the Harriman exit on the Thruway, Big Jack pulled over to a shoulder and sat back heavily in his seat, exhausted. \I think we got us some trouble, boys,\ he said quietly.

Alan Rutkin, <;hairperson of the Tax Colllff).ittee., presented .this year's stud·ent activity budget, with the exception of six organizations which have not yet met with the Tax Com- mittee; He explained that allocations were 111ade on the basis of each activity's submitted budget, assuming that the requests . were legitimate and that they Were aimed at fulfilling the purpose of each organization. There was discussion as to the . best method of approving these · budgets, and it was decided that the Student Tax Committee shOuld meet with th~remaining organizations, and then return · to the Forwn for approval of the total package. The Forwn then turned to a discussion of the elections for Greek System Examined. byPAM RYAN ThJ~ 17 frate.rnities and sororities at Union play an important social role in the lives of many students. Their effect is even more significant to the large numbers of students wbo are actually members of these societies. An Ad Hoc Committee on Fr~ternities and Sororities was formed ln October by the Stud.ent 'Life .Committee to examine the role of the Greek societjes at Union and to try te come up with some broad policies and guidelines. The ad hoc committee has thus far met with fraternity and ·sorority presidents, Director of Housing {)av\d Wood, Director of Security CUffoiid Wood, and some independents, in an at- tempt to look into the Greek situation-as it stands at Union .... It has also been looking into. the fraternity and sorority systems of various other colleges, such as Dartmouth and Hamilton, and comparing them with the system at .Union. The idea behind · all this is to try -and determine the strong and weak points of the Greek system and to determine what changes, if any, are needed. One area being examined by the committee is the housing situation. This includes the tights of independents living in Greek hauses, the procedure by which independents are placed in houses, and what recourse independents and Gree·ks · should have~ Also being examined are the pros and cons behind the creation of a \house manager\ position., criteria for deter· mining use charge figures, bousing contracts,'maintenanee responsibilities, and procedlires for members returning frorn leaves of absenc-e or terms abroad. It must also be determi'ne-d whether or not separate policies must be ap- plied to the private fraternities because of their- different contractual arrangements. Also being/ examined are aspects of tlie Greek system itself. Among these are the best structure for the PHC, the idea of a PHC Conduct Committee to regulate Greek group behavior, the best \rush\ philosophy for Union,: and the most ad- vantageous '_'rush\ schedule. ··Administrative affairs, such as the collection of debts owed the college by the fraternities and sororities and difficulties witli the pledge meal plan are being discussed, and -policies considered. The possibilities of ex;pansion or contraction of the system, along with the feasibility of an alumni advisory council to the fraternity - sorority system are also being considered. At this point the committee is simply.. _examining various aspects of .the . Greek system. Committee members -- are meeting with Fraternity and sorority presidents and members, independents, and various administrators, to get feedback on the various issues being ,examined. The com- mittee has been given a broad charge by the Student Life Committee to look into various areas, examine alternatives, and make recommendations. For students interested in contri'buting input to the cormnittee, members available to contact are Joe Zolner, Assistant Dean of Students;. Bob Heron;. students Mike Squier, Charles Dexter, Lori Walter, . Nancy Gagliano, George Redder, Mike Marrone, and Richard Roth. Input to the committee would be much appreciated by the members.

There was a brief, mai·nly explanatory and clarifying discussion of the preface and introduction by ·steve Richards. Discussion then tur.ned to the membership of the policy councils and review boards. In the new system, these groups would consist of students, faculty, ad- ministration and staff. The councils would recommend policy in areas of student af. fairs, academics and finance to administrators. The review boards will be responsible for hearing cases of academic matters, conduct, tenurability, etc. In the report, it is stipulated that some of the student terms would be for a duration of two years. ConGern was expressed by several members of the Forum that this might limit the ap- plicant pool because it might exclude otherwise capable students who wish to take a term abroad: It was also mentioned that the new system would only include 20 students as opposed to the present system involving 78 students. Discussion then turned to the Student Review Board found in the governance report. This b -;1y would be responsible for reviewing matters of student conduct and academics, whereas this year thse functions are carried out by separate groups. Ol)jection was raised con- cerning the content of the board; in the proposed .system, faculty members would have the majority over student members. It was expressedthaf this does not fulfill the assumption of peer review as stipulated in the introduction to the governance report. It was felt by other Forum memb-ers that faculty members should serve on this review board, and should be involved in both academic and co.nduct decisions, as they woulcl add a measure of credibility to these deCisions. At this point an alternative to the structure of the Board was proposed, but tabled until further details could be presented to the Fortlll] on paper. Andrew Mitchell, representative to the Forum from the EPC, spoke next on the engineering req 1.1irements passed that afternoon by .the All College Senate. He also presented an academic ad, vising report which EPC has begun discussing. This report identifies certain problem areas in the present advising system and. suggests possible solutions. A copy of this report is available in the Student Activities · Office for review and comments. Murray Levison then ex- plained that the Committee on Committees has set a policy that any committee member · appointed to the Student Tax Committee must resign from their former committee position. _ Murray, a · member of the Dean of Admissions . Search Cominittee, also informed the memi;K!rs.of the Forwn that the next Dean of Admissions candidate, Francis B. \Spike\ Gummere, will be on campus Feb. 19 and 20, and will be available for an open meeting with students at 2 p.m. on Monday, Feb: 19 in Hale Ho~e Lower Lounge. What's Your Minor? by GEM MITCHELL Educational philosophy has come full swing from the liberal, 'design your own program,' days of the 1960's. Harvard has reinstated a core GUrriculum, and Union has abolished its Comprehensive Education. Liberal Learning represents a bold step towards creating an institution which will produce educationally well;. balanced minds. Recently, another program was conceived which supports Union's trend towards more rigid academic requirements: Mike Arato, student metnber of the Educational Policy Committee (EPC), has proposed that each \student be required to complete a minor concentration in a department which is outside of their division of major concentration.\ Engineers and ACS chemists may be exempted from this re<(uirement due to the already rigid _ natures of their curriculae. Arato's proposal justifies this action on the grounds that \liberal learning falls short of ensuring adequate com~ petence\ because it only serves to ••introduce\ students. to different disciplines. Ideally, liberal learning should generate an environment in which each of us woUld assess our academic needs and interests and, ac- cordingly, satisfy them. - He cJtes increasing com· petition for graduate school and job openings as the culprit in a System whlch \reeks of per- sonal expediency. What is needed is some regulation of this academic freedom. Let the student decide what the best path to pursue is, but require that a specific path be taken.\ Specifically, the proposal stipulates: I. That interdisciplinary majors be permitted to combine two disciplines from a single division. All other combinations will be considered as \organi theme majors •' and must be submitted to the Associate Dean of Faculty for approval. - II. That each department be asked to create, and then to state officially, a pattern of courses J some required, some elective) which it would deem a suitable and coherent minor. The minor should consist of approximately six courses. III. That each student be required to complete a minor concentration in a department that is outside of their division of. major concentration. The above is a proposal for an academic major·minor program that is currently under consideration by the EPC. Although the proposal is in its infancy, the committee would welcome student input in the form of constructive criticism during the course of their consideration' of the program. t •

OONOO:RDIENSIS,' February 1$, 19\19 New Trends At UC: - - . . ' ' 6- Year Med Program View8d · \ ' \ . Dr. Willard Roth--chairman of the Biology Department. by NEAL CABRAL All of us rememl>er that noxious nerve-rac~ing .process of applying to college. And surely we can recall that first interview wbere we aU tried to be as. refined and articl,l]ate ·as William F. Buckley and more often than not come across about. as definitively as Charlie Brown. Somehow we survived. Perhaps because · the in- terviewer showed at least some vestiges of humanism a·nd sympathy. Yet there are some forty students at Union College who can recall having been Internships Offered by SUE BARNHART This spring term the Sociology Department will again be offering its Internship in the DeUvery of Social Sciences. The program, which has been in operation for the past t'Wo years, is under the direction of Professor Frank Carlile. In the past fifteen to twenty students have par- ticipated in the course which places them in a wide variety of social service intern positions throughout the Capital District. The program, conceived two years ago models a similar program set up at Duke University by Professor Eugene Schneller. The program aims to place students among the workings of community seFving organ~tions in order for them to · receive a pictur.e of the workings of these organizations. Among the agencies· currently involved in the program include the Schenectady Health Depart- ment, P~anned Parenthood, the United Way, Wli;IHT-TV, and the Schenectadv Probation Department. Students accepted to the program are expected to spend between fifteen to twenty hours . a week at the agency they have been assigned to. Although the duties of the students will vary from agency to agency, generally students will study the agency's general operatims and problems. Once the student · is familiar with the operation of the organization he or she Will usually be assigned the task of researching or performing skilled tasks for the organizations. In addition students will be required to participate in a seminar in which his ex- periences within his organization will be discussed. . A final report will also be required of the student in which he will discuss his overall ex- perience within.· the organization. How are students accepted into the program? According to Professor Carlile students applying for the internship must meet the qualifications of an organization participating in the program. There are many organizations in ne..ed of interns and it is hoped that most ap- plying can fulfill the quali!i~ations of ort~ of. the available or.ganua.tions .requiring interns and receive acceptance into the program.. However due to the difficulties in r.unn!n_g an internship program tt Is necessary to limit t~e. n~ber of students par- hctpatmg . to approximately twenty students. Professor Carlile stated \We have enough internships to give interested students. Usually there are more agencies wanting qualified students than there are qualified students.\ Students applying or in- terested 'in doing so should attend . an orientation meeting on W~dnesday, February 21st at 7:30 p.m. in the lounge on the second floor of the. Social Science building. Applications ar~ due February 28th in the Sociology · nepartment office.

OONCORDIENSIS, February 15, 1919 6-Year Med Program Viewed \ ® * t~ Dr. Willard Roth-<:hairman of the Biology Department. by NEAL CABRAL AU of us remember that noxious nerve-racking process of applying to college. And surely we can recall that fi:rst interview where we aU tried to be as refined and articulate as WilHam F. Buckley and more often than not come across about as defmitively as Charlie Brown. Somehow we survived. Perhaps because the in- terviewer showed at least same vestiges of humanism and sympathy. Yet there are some forty students at Union College who can recall having been Internships Offered by SUE BARNHART This spring term the Sociology Department will ~gain be offe~ing its Internship m the Delivery of Secial Sciences. The program, which has been in operation for the past two years, is under the direction of Professor Frank Carlile. In the past fifteen to twenty students have par- ticipated in the course which places them in a wide variety of social service intern positions throughout the Capital District. The program, conceived two years ago models a similar program set up at Duke University by Professor Eugene Schneller. The program aims to place students among the workings of community serving organizations in order for them to receive a picture of the workings of these organizations. Among the agencies· currently involved in the program include the Schenectady Health Depart- ment, Planned Parenthood, the United Way, WMHT-TV, and the Schenectadv Probation Department. Students accepted to the program are expected to spend between fifteen to twenty hours a week at the agency they have been assigned to. Although the duties of the students will vary from agency to agency, generally students will study the agency's general operations and problems. Once the student is familiar with the operation of the arganization he or she will usually be assigned the task of researching or performing skilled tasks for the organizations. In addition students will be required to participate in a seminar in which his ex- periences within his organization will be discussed. A final report will also be required of the student in which he will discuss his overall ex- perience within· the organization. How are students accepted into the program? According to Professor Carlile students applying for the internship must meet the qualifications of an organization participating in the pregram. There are many organizations in need of interns and it is hoped that most ap- plying can fulfill the qualifications of one of the available organizatians requiring interns and receive acceptance into the program. Haw ever due to the difficulties in running an internship program it is necessary to limit the nwnber of students par- ticipating ta approximately twenty students. Professor Carlile stated \We have enough internships to give interested students. Usually there are mare agencies wanting qualified students than there are qualified students.\ Students applying er in- terested in doing so should attend an orientation meeting on Wednesday, February 21st at 7:30 p.m. in the lounge on the second floor of the Social Science building. Applications are due February 28th in the Sociology Department office. St11dents will be informed before the end of preregistration whether or not they have received acceptance into the program. asked such .pertinent questions such as \Who is the present Poet Lauerate?\ or \Do you think y:eu could really kill somebody?\. And at least one of these select students recalls having spent tl\e first twenty minutes listening to the in- terviewer try to talk him out of of applying to the college. Though this may so1:1nd somewhat extraordinary it is aU part of the elaborate screening process which determines the twen.ty students, aut of 500 plus applicants, who will be ad- . mitted to Unions Six Year Med Program. This rigorous selection process is one of the key factors in allowing Union to proudly boast lhat not one of the forty students admitted to date has opted to quit the program. In the words of Dr. Willard Reth, who chairs the department, the program has been \far mere successful than we had any right to anticipate\. The six year students apparently concur with Dr. Roth However, .. they stress that the program is certainly not for everyone aspiring to become a doctor.

These sacrifices include taking four courses for each of two summers at Union. In additi()n extra-curricular ac- tivities. course selection, and spare time are severly limited.

One student felt that \in the first year I had no idea how much r would miss my summer vacation and once I made it through I felt I had gone to far to quit now.\ Parenta.l pressure, money, and the mexorable f1mneling of the program were also cited as major reasons for net leaving the program. It would appear that getting aut of the program is as difficl:llt as getting in. The program has many positive aspects however, one·of which is the required second major in some field other than the sciences. The six year students supported this requirement vehemently. They felt that amengst other things it made for a well rounded person. In terms of extra curricular activities as one student put it \you can make your own time if you really want to.\ It is the integration of these six year students tnto the · cellege that has pleased Dr. Roth with the programs progress. He feels that the students are actively par- ticipating in all facets of the college such as theater, clubs and of course the social life, despite their heavy· course load. I:n fact the only proposed change of any scope that is being considered for the ·program is an extension from six years to seven.

In a recent interview, Mr. John Hauser, who is in charge .of Union College energy con- se.rvation pro:gram, offered · some briefhistory and statistics on Uriion College energy use. Energy usage on campus was not of any concern \Ultil the early 1970's. Up until this time energy costs were, · for tl)e school as they w.ere for ever;vone else, quite minimal. The second method listed was .increasing the efficiency of the energy management system. Toward this· end., a· com- puterized monitoring unit .has alreac;ly been inst~lled. At present, it is only hooked up to the fire alarrn system. Con- necting the heating system t(;) this monitoring system would cost as mucb as $50,000, .but the ·savings would more than make up for the initial cost in a matter of yeats. Miscellaneous modifi'ca:tions, such as conversion in lighting from incande.scent to fiourescent, also have large cost outlays, but would pay for themselves w:ithin thr-ee to four years. The problem with each of these conservation techniques is that they require a large initial outlay of money that the College cannot easily afford. In Order to Form a More Perfect Faculty Since tne Arab oil ern:b~rgo of 1973, however, costs have skyrocketed to the point where the college .n()W spends $750;000 per year on f,lnergr. Th~s is an increase at 10 percent to 20 percent per year. . To see this. number with a little better perspective, this breaks down to about $300,000 for electricity an~ $450,000 for fuel oil totalling 25 percent of all maintenance costs. If we were to trace this money:b~,~ck .to the student~. then each Union College .'student. is paying almost $400 a year for energy. At the current rat~ of inflation for our im}><)rted fuel oils, this figure would double in as little as five years. Obviously in these times of growing . consciousness over energy, cQnsumption, even the smanest. savings make . a big difference. The two questions on the consumption of energy at Union rel~te to what the· College itself is doing to improve energy efficiency and what the student can. do to essentially save himself money. · · With regards to the College, a study- was authorized by the College and was performed last year by a member of the Saratoga Associated.

The dean- tl)en clears this with the provost, and the department head is given the go-ahead to begin the recruiting process. The position is then advertised, as required by law, in various [}rofessional journals and affirmative action sources.

As is the case with most colleges, Union pays for the applicant's transportation and accommodations in Schenectady. Once on campus, the can- didates ga through what De~n Brownless referred to as a \strenuous day\ or two here. The applicant is interviewed by the dean and the provost. He or she speaks with department members, takes a campus tour, and is taken out to dinner with the department members. The candidate also speaks at a colloquium which is attended by the department faculty, student representatives, and any in- terested observers. This · presentation is weighted heavily. , According to Martha Huggins a new sociology professor at Union, there is a tendency to feel nervous and 'watched during the .selection process. However, she said that she felt at ease at Union, and was treated kindly by everyone. Prof. Huggins, in addition to the standard parts of the interview process, taught an introductory sociology class. Dean Brownlee fpels this is a good idea, wlthough it is very unusual. The dean also said that because of the strain involved it would not always be a good indicator of the candidate'steaehing ability. After all of the candidates have gone through the selection process, the department members and student repres.entatives make a decision in an open-discussion format. The chairperson in· forms the dean of the decision, and sh~ usually agrees with the choice. If there is strong disagreement the search may begin again.

Slle feels that Union has a serious need to address this problem. However, she made it clear that a minority or woman candidate will not be hired simply because they are part of a minority. A special ·effort is made, though, to find these candidates and to let them participate equally in the selection process. This is the way that Union and most other colleges choose professors.

It's the sort of thing that takes years and years to develop. So when the S()cial Com- mittee, in its program of events for last weekend's Winter Carnival, made &references to the event's \traditional flair,\ there was reason for skep- ticism. After all, this year's was only the fourth Winter Carnival here. Compared to similar, more venerable and well known activities elsewhere--most notably at Dartmollth in New Hampshire-that makes Union's Winter Carnival a mere infant by comparison. Hardly the stuff of which traditions are made. Looking back niJW on the weekend, a couple of im- pressions are particularly vivid. First, the weather was tremendous. Sure, it was cold. But the crisp, clmulless days are an example of the best this area has to offer at this time of year. The pleasant weather was everyone's good fortune, but it's not something any particular group can take credit for. The Social Committee m~y have set the date for the -'Winter Car- nival-and having it during the fifth week of the term does a nice job of breaking up a win- tertime that'.s too lomg, cold and dreary for most people's tastes- ·but they couldn't have had the foresight to know what the outside conditions would be like. Rather ,they were responsible for the activities that made up the event. And saying that many of them were --a little ragged around the edges is probably being kind. That's not to say that or,ganizing this kindofevent is a simple task. Most of-.us realiz~ that it requires plenty of preparation, in addition to the work that's necessary to carry it off. In fact, if any blame is to be laid, it must be equally shared by the vast majority of the faculty and student body-- myself included--who-didn't bother to show up for most of the goings-on. No matter, how well planned . an event is, it's going to fall flat on its face without some active support. And citing as a reason for .non-attendance that something bas no prior track record--and therefore might turnout. to be a waste of time-is no excuse at all. Those who hold to this alibi would do well to remember an old axiom: Nothing ventured, nothing gained. . Happily•-especially, as it turned out, for the participants-- some 500 students decided to take a chance on the carnival ball Saturday night at the Ramada Inn on Nott Street. Especially considering . last year's disappointing -ball, people had more than ample reason to be wary· of the chances for a good time this time around. Put simply, the odds are distinctly notin favor of such an event's running smoothly. Arranging and carrying out such a function for so many people Is a major feat in itself~ And its difficulty is corn- pounded considerably by the lackof nearby facilities that can handle such ·a gatbering. The area surrounding Schenectady is hardly a noted convention center, and many who attended last year's ball have not•so.:fond memories of traveling via schoolbus to a £acUity that clearly wasn't up, __ to the challen!!e· · The S(!henectady Ramada Ir:m is hardly the kind of place that's worthy of any great notice, but it did quite well to meet the demands placed ·upon it last Saturday nigfit. The dinner part of the dinner- dance didn't do anything to annoy patrons, but it was the latter portion that .most people will probably long remember- and quite favorably. Good dance bands are all too few and far between, making Synod, the group that per- foimed Saturday night, all the more unusual.- For three-and-a- half solid hours they played a variety of tunes, almost certain to please anyone's tastes, with commendable skill. · It all added up-to what for this reporter was one of the most enjoyable evenings Union College has' had to .offer. I'd- think most others in attendance would agree. In calling th~ ball \truly the highlight of the weekend,'' the Social Conunittee could have been setting up a huge disap- pointment. But it was, in the end, an accurate description. Th~t's got to please just about everyone. For it's thatkind of event that builds the feeling of tradition that makes such an activity as Union's Wint.er Carnival • something that causes people to stop what they 1 re doing and stand up to take notice. 1 'Bani.o Dan and the Midnight Playboys~• ~erformed in the Dutch Hollow Pub Friday night to a standing room only orowd.

etk We- ... is \a a CONOORDIENSIS, Feb'MU),ry 15, 1979 Page 7 On And Off Broadway by StEVE MONOSSON - The darker side of the struggle of existence has been considered by playwrights for <if> long :as tnere have been plays; but there is a rather novel trend In approaching. the matter Which is being pursued by several contemp.orary dra·rnatists. This approach .. involves the use of ex- traordimtry situations and characters to express ideas concerning the triumph over or defeat by obstacles whi:ch face us throughout the course of our lives. · Although Wings, the play by Artbur Ko.pi:t currently showing at the Lyceurn Theatre onBroadway,.concerns a stroke victim, it is the effect -of the stroke on the woman's character which is the essential focus gf the piece . .Seduced, by Sarn Shepard at the American Place 'Theatre on 46th Street Off-Broadway 'til February 25th;examines the last days of a Howard Hughes type millionaire-recluse and at- teiT!pts to ma'ke a number of statements which transcend the physical interactions. of . the play. E:n:periencing a stroke or becoming .so rich .that it hurts may -not be. commonplace oc·eurrences,- but there are truths revealed in each case which are .inherent in the humilll condition. 11m plight of Emily Stilson, the former biplane ''wing walker'~ of Wings, is a fascinating journey from the mordant conflll!ion of the stroke · to recovery and back to near death again. As exquisitely portrayed by Constance Cummings, Mrs. Stilson's strqggJe to overcome her af- flicti<m is symptomatic of any bUll1an struggle. Her frus• tr ation ·at breaking through mental barriers; her lapsing into escapist fantasies; and her joy at the progtess she. does make are ·happenings not l(nique to cases of brain <lamage. - 1 The play itself is a highly taut, bnpressionistic near monologue by Miss Cummings. The sup- porting characters' presence is kept at a minimum in order to- focus attention on Mrs. Stilson. James Tolkan_ does a memorable bit. as Billy, a man with a brain tmnor. The beauty of his portrayal is that it is not a gross par(}dy of such brain damage.; but rath~r he demonstrates how the person affects the illness--not vice versa . The cUrection by J'ohn Madden keeps this ·precise, relatively · short drama energetic amf suffused with spirit. Deserving of equal ·-recognition is set designer Andrew Jackness, whose set, of doors which constantly open and dose, visualizesthe thought processes of Emily Stilson, Tom Voegli's .sound e-ffects and Tom .Schrader's righting round out a crew whose efforts are essential to the production, for without them half of the show's imagery would be lost. - AU in all, Wings is an unqualified success which should' run for a very long time. Seduced, on tbe other hand, . which is set to run untU FebruarY 25th, attempts. to accomplish more than it ac- tually does. The action centers on one Henry Hackarnore, who lives ·in selMmposed exile and ·e~ibits manyfraits identieal to those of the. late Howard Hu:ghes. He is incessantly sanitary; he has financed and built an expensive airplane which turned out to be a miserable flop; and he refuses to put his name to anything ln, fear of \signing his .fife awa:y .... Hackamore asserts that life has \seduced'-' him, and to a certain extent this is true. Life has shown him aU of its riches, onty to leave bun in a paranoia<!, bro~en state. Any attempt at returning t«> normal life, such as when he invited two of his fonner \ to visit him, become ridiculous ventures which only serve to highlight his incapacity to deal . with the outside world. When he is finally asked by one of the invitees why she has been brought down to the island, he honestly has no answer for her. Unbenownst - to · him personal guardian . has been determining his life and its appearance to the outside world for the past fifty years. For a man who is· supposed to have everything, the ·impression left is of a man with nothing. The affectations of excessive wealth do not serve as well as . those. of mental health in- making a statement outside \:of the literal one. The viewer is more anxious to see what aspect of Howard HugheS' life will he demonstrated next rather than being interested in any sym· holism or connotations of the material. The question, \Is there satisfacti9n, even at any cost'!\ is one which does remain; and .it is for that reason, along with the per• formance of Rip Torn as Hackamore, which make thiS play stnl only slightly memorable, If playwright · Shepare:t's intention was to speculate on the life of Howard Hughes, then he is successful. Yet, if this is the case, why _not call it \The Last Days of Howard Hughes?\ Director Jack· Gelber's pacing is solid in most in· stances, and Henry Millman's set admirably portrays the- bareness of the landscape known as the life of- Henry Hackamore. They, as well as many others involved in the production, do their best with the sometimes · lacking material. This is not a bad play, just one that could do more than it actually does. But, as is the history of Sam Shepard's fine current drama \Buried Child,\ a little reworking cc;uldturn this show into a highly worthwhile production. ''Buried Child\ ran a year earlier in a somewhat different form. Next season We just might have a very fine Sam Shepard drama to enjoy. Serious drama, today, is looking for exceptions to serve as examples for the ·conunon man. Stroke victitns, alienated millionaires, disfigured freaks of nature (from \The Elephant Man'') and cancer victims (from \Cold Storage\) are populating the modern stage with a degree of success. Perhaps modern man has become more concerned with those who are not blessed with wnat most take for granted in their everyday _lives. It also can be argued that modern man has become one-dimensional and uninteresting to write about. Whatever the case may be, it is a meritorious device; and as long as the device does not bec9me -more important than the character, an ·intriguing prc:~duction will rrwst alway~ result. ---·-c Area Calendar-· - MUSIC Feb. 17...;This ·saturday enjoy an evening of poetry and jazz .in celebration of Mro-American History month, with the Albany Pilb1ic Library.

For those Who need some in- spiration, the theme of the yearbook deals with the changes of Union College through the seasons or, more generally, \transitions.\ In addition, Union Book is asking for general submissions of photography, literature-- short stories, essays, poetry or critical letters-and any and all drawings or sketches you would like to see incorporated into the yearbook. Please direct all literary artistic and photographic works to Debbe Damrell, · Box 686, or Fran Davis, Box 200, or leave them with Mrs. Marra in the Student Activities office. The staff is also desirous of more photographers. If you are interested regardless of ex- perience, please contact.

Continued from page 1 baH-courses and, indeed, noted that the pedagogical aims of extended absorption time between class meetings and, in this case, the availability of computer time, were well served by, in effect, spreading the substance of a single course over more than one term. Mr. Schmidt informed the com· mittee that fractional courses cause no significant problem for the Registrar and that such courses already existed in the offerings of lAM. Finally, the proposed half-unit courses, to substitute in pairs for single less flexible courses, stru~k the committee as a reasonable approach w \fine-tuning\ the curriculum in engineering. This proposal passed after a short explanation by Prof. Craig of the new courses in comparison to those tieing replaced. The final proposal, increasing the number of course requirements for an engineerihg major, read as follows: 3. Proposal from the. EPC: that it be Union's policy tG require up to thirty·eiglt1 courses for the baccalaureate degree in engineering, provided that no student be required hi carry an overload of more thaD one-half course (.or its equivalent) In any given term, and provided .that tuition be charged for all courses. JUSTIFICATION Although not au members of the EPC are equally persuaded that a professional engineering program is the kind best suited to a small college, tbe com• mittee nevertheless accepts the notion that, since tbe engineering faculty at Union is wholly committed to this kind of program, the most reasonable course of action .for the EPC is to help the established program w become as strong as pl)ssible. In the judgement of. the engineering facqlty, as well as in the judgement of the agency which accredits · professional undergraduate engineering programs, tbe number of class hours devoted to technical material in the engineering program at Union is marginal. In order that one or even two · electives could be added to the major requirements in engJneeriog without violating the spirit of proposal No. l; above, it was .proposed that the total number .of courses to be required. for the bachelor's degree in engineering be per- mitted to increase, at the option of the engineering departments, . to thirty-eight. With the stated provisions concennng tuition and loading, the EPC saw no educational reason for rejecting the proposal and indeed, m view of Union's ewn past precedent for· requiring slightly more course work for engineering students (until about tw.enty years ago) and in view of policy at. certain. other strong non-technical . institutions (notable Brown ·Mass. The men also visited Smith College in Northampton, Mass., and attended an or• chestra coneert conducted by Donald Wheelock (Union '62). and held there in John M. Green Hall on Friday evening. Family ,Lecf:ures A series of lectures, open to the. public, on ''Special Topics on the American Family\ is being offered by the .sociolQgy department and Union's chapter of Alplla Kappa Delta, the sociology honor society. 'rhe series started Jitn. 30 with a talk: by :Sonnie Tem- pleton1 director of the · parent aide program, Child Abuse Neglect Council, Inc., on ''Child Abuse:· Victims and Public Respense.\ Future lecturers include: \M.arital Conflict: The Extreme Case o( Wife Abuse,\ Sandra Gerrish, crises and referral coordinator, Crises Interv~ntion Project, Tuesday, Feb. 20. · - ''Family Break~up: Legal Aspects and Contemporary Trends,\ Judge Howard A. Levine, Family Court, Schenectady County, and ad- ministrative judge for family court, fourth judicial district, Monday, Feb. 26. All of the above lectures will · · start at 4:30 p.m. in Strauss Lounge, Carnegie Hall. Admission is free. This is the first lecture series sponsored jointly by the sociology department and the newly-created chapter of Alpha Kappa Delta, said Ilene Kaplan, sociology instructor and chapter adviser. \Each lecture is open to the public, and we hope that each will be well attended. ''The current series should be of interest to many people both • • University) which_ also require the equtvalent of -two extra courses· for engineering students, the EPC .regarded the propos~! as a reasonable move toward strengthening Unlou's englneering ptogram. · There was no dispute as to the desirability of requiring ad~ ditional courses for an engineering major. Members of the Senate were, instead, more concerned with the matter of additional tuition. After some discussion, Prof. Schaeffer- proposed that the last line (. . . and provic:led that tuition be charged for all courses) he deleted, believing that levying tuition charges should be left to the administration. Using an example from several ye~rs ago, a precedent was brought· up that in fact the Senate can legislate matters concerning tuition. Considering this point, the substitute proposal was defeated and Proposal No.3 as originally presented was passed. . These change& were designed to improve Union's engineering curriculum so that it may better meet the requirements of the ECPD. Ill addition, labs whicb have been incorpOrated into several lower-level courses and the new liberal learni·ng - program satisfy certain .parts of the ECPD evaluation.

Ski Team by ALLAN MOLHO Once ,again paced by Sophomore Fred Thimm, the Union. College Ski Team produced an excellent showing in the Division II Regional Ch·ampionships hosted by Clarkson Col1ege. against such strong teams as Cornell, Colgate and Army, Union placed sixth and just missed gaining a chance to compete in ·the Division II Championships Baseball coach Dick Sakala . at Norwich Vermont. Union was only 12 combined event points short of 5th place, taken by RPI, the final qualifying spot for the Norwich meet .this weekend. Baseball News:: Sakala Interim Coach lJyST£VEN G. SINGER . J . Almost two months ago, Uni9lfs varsity baseball coach, Tom Cahill, was operated. upon. The doctors performed what .is called a \coron~y. bypass.\ During his recuperation 11eriod of 60 to 90 days, his doctors recommended limited activity. . . As a result, in keeping· with the doctors'· orders, Cahill's colleague, Richard Saka.la, director of athletics here, ''felt it would be proper to assume the duties of temporary VC\rsity baseball coach.\ · Sakala willbe assisted by Bob Driscoll, Union's assistant hockey coach, who has worked With the baseball team for the last two years under Coach Cahill. Sakala himself has C()nsiderable coaching ex- perience as the former varsity baseball coach at Colwnbia University in New York. Sakala coached at Columbia for five years. While Sakala was unwilling to comment on how the last- minute manuever will effect Union's oil-field performance this year, he did state that the team is ''unified\ and will begin wor~ing out today, as scheduled. Sakala was strong · in his assertion that CahUl' s replacement is merely a temporary move. Said Sakala, \I don't want him worrying about baseball when he shouldn't even be involved in that type of acijvity.\ Continued Sakala, \This is an interim thing Tom Cahill is still the baseball coach at Union College whenever he's available to resume his duties.\ Cahill, who would normally handle both the b~seball team and recruitment for the football team during this time of year, will still be needed to take care of the latter. \After being out for a month and a half,\ Sakalanoted~ \he'll have plenty to do around the office • especially with so many recruits coming in around this time.\ Sakata is presently talking to each .player individually, a~­ tempting to get to know them and find out· everything about them. And while he is adinittedly ''looking forward to\ his new, but temporary, position, Sakala welcomes any help Coach Cahill can give hem. . \I'd like to see him gradually come back into things.'' As for Coach Cahill's.future at Union, Sakala stated unequivically ~hat Cahill will be at the helm of both the baseball and football squads next year, \and hopefully for many years to come.'j In the Alpine events held in sub-zero temperatures, Thimm was theqUicke~t in the-grueling slalom as he too~ first place. Then in the giant slalom he was m.ore than a second faster than Cornell's best John Skinner, again finishing on top. Fresh- men Jeff Ince determined to improve on his performance from the week before had a fine day as he finished 17th in the giant slalom and 20th in the slalom out of 60 racers. Eugene Kliot also did extremely well in the giant slalom as he finished 14th. Also notable in ooth races was Brad Kline as he placed better than more than half of the other racers. Due to this combined effort Union finished 4th in the Alpine events. · The next day in unimaginable cold weather and stiff com- petition, the Cross Country tearn braved both these elements and continued their improvement. Ed Hortsman , Steve Matuzak andBrad Fisher finished 25th, 29th · and 3oth respectively iJt the 15km race out .of . 63 competetors. In the meets final event, Eugene Kliot who won the week before at the Alfred meet, this week dueled with Mike Dunham of Cornell for .first place ill the 35m ski jump. Both were far superior to the rest of the jumpers and each promoted gasps from spec- tators as they sailed toward the bottom of the hill.

Wome:n Cagers 5-2 The womeni's basketball team · went 2-2 this past week defeating New Paltz twice and losing to RPI and Skidmore. The Dutchwomen travelled to Troy to face a tough, well balanced RPI team. Union trailed most of the game, but a tenacious .press and some hot shooting by Carol Wrenn {10 pts.) and Debbie Downey (12 pts.) sent tbe game into over- time, where RPI capitalized on two trips to the foul line to d~feat Union by a heart .. breaking score of 61 to 59. Union botinced back later in the week to beat a flu- beleagured New Paltz team 79 to 22. Union played an aggresslve defense and got scoring' help from all ten players. Junior forward Patti Hamilton tumed in a super performance scoring 12 pts. and grabbing 17 rebounds. Deb Downey .and Deb Sears assisted the effort with 10 points each, while Liz Yager, Sears and Sandy Key hauled down 10, 13, and 11 rebounds respectively as Union completely dominated oile boards. Travelling north to play in the 1st Skidmore invitational Tournament the Dutchwornen received an icy rec.eption from . the host team in an even icier gym. The Skiddies were hot in this frigid environment, playing a tough defense which forced many turnovers which they were able to convert into baskets. The warmhearted, but coldhanded Union women were unable to defrost their game plan in what proved to be their most frustrating game to date. Deb Sears and Shelia O'Donnell led Union scorers with 15 and 14 pts. respectively. Patti Hamilton grabbed 11 rebQ.unds and added 10 pts. to Union's total, f'Or a disappointing 66 to 49 loss. On the following day Union met a healthy New Paltz team. Although snow was expected, the Dutchwomen quickly ac· clomated themselves and broke the game open in the second half shooting 43 per~ent from the floor and holding New Paltz to only 11 pts. Deb Sears led Union with 18 pts., 16 rebounds and 6 steals. Shelia. O'Donnell . and Patti Hamilton also were · hothanded scoring 12 .and 1l pts. and grabbing 8 bounds a piece. Union's victory enabled the Dutch women to bring home the consolation round trophy, the first tournament tropny ever for a women's team at this school. J.V. Hoopers Win Two by BILL CURTIN · The Union JV basketball team had an outstanding week beating highly regarded Hamilton c College an then disposing of a surging Albany Junior College. With these wins they raised their record to 5-3. The Dutchmen were hosted at the Clinton, NY campus last Wednesday and posted a somewhat easy 91-83 win over the HamiltonJV's. Union was in control from start to finiSh. The Continentals were using a zone press for most of the game and the Dutchmen were very suc- cessful in breaking the press resulting in many converted two on one · breaks. They combined· these breaks with a tough defense which was keyed by the tenacious board play of the Union front line to open up as much as a 22 point lead midway through the second half. The front line was led by . Seth Mendelowitz who pulled down a number of rebounds. The Garnet were led in scoring by Joe Uvegas, Jeff Peters and· Bruce Jakiel with 22, 21 and 18 points respectively. The Dutchinen returned home to face Albany Junior College who had been . on a six game winning streak. Union got off to a slow start trailing 9-2 but quickly tied the score at 12 and from there on were 9ever really threatened as they hit the century plateau for the first tll,ne this year winning 10().83. The Dutchmen moved the ball around very well with a con· trolled fast break and a patient offense. Mike Canning played an outstanding game scoring 22 points and had many assists and steals to add to his sterling performance. Bruce J akiel had a strong game on the boards while hitting for 16 points and Jeff Peters threw in 19. On Tuesday night Union faced what will probably be the most formidable opponet on their schedule in Division I Yale. They return for two home contests this week.

The losses dropped _.their season record to 7~11 with seven games remaining. Last Wednesday against the Continentals of Hamilton College, the Dutchmen played well, losing by a score of 70~0 .. Hamilton is ranked 8th nationally in the Division Ul polls and holds a 44 game home win streak, the longest such -.treak of any 4-year college in .he nation. Not surprisingly, 3- time ·All-American Cedri·c Oliver led 16-1 Hamilton with 28 points and 12 rebounds. Union had the lead four times in the first half and went into the lockerroom at halftime down only 38-35. Dan Koubek was instrumental in Union's first half attack with 12 points and 5 rebounds. HamHton got off to a fast start in the second half and raced to 49-39 lead. But the Dutchmen, led by the rebounding of Jim McGhee who snared 10 carems in the half, rallied and pulled to within four. 61-'57, With 6:20 left. Union, however, managed just 3 points the rest of the way and Cedric Oli~er had 5 and John MaGee and Bruce Weir added 2 each ftorn the charity stripe for Hamilton to make the· final 70- 60. Greg Sobocinski, Joe Car- dany and Koubek scored 16, 12, and 12 respectively for the Dutchmen. John Jarosak dished out 7 assists. Hockey Game Tonight Friday night in Rochestef. the Dutchmen failed to come up With the clutch shots when they neededthemas UR pulled away in the waning seconds to Win .82- 75. The contest featured 11 ties and 14 lead changes, truly in- dicative of the closeness of the game. John Jatosak's 14 first half .pQints helped the Dut- chmen to a 4()..38 .halftime lead. In the second half, a 10-4 spurt by the UR Yellowjackets gave them a 70-65lead with 4;26 left to play. But a 6-1 Union spl,II't keyed by sharp shooting reserve Frank Miller, (pressed into action because of foul trouble to Kn;tm and Koubek) Union College's hockey team returns to Achilles Rink tonight following a four-game road series. The 5-16 Dutchmen will meet Cortland at 8 p;m.-a team which they number among their five victims this rebuilding season. Following that garne Union returns to the highways playing at Holy Cross on Saturday and at Lowell University next Sunday. They conclude the season the following week with .a home stand against Merrimack Feb. 24 and Colgate Feb. 28.

The dinner was sponsored by the Friends of Union Athletics, a group of about 200 prominent citizens of Schenectady that promotes our sport's program, The team would especially like to thank the members who attended: Mr. Clinton Braid- wood (President of Schenectady ·chemicals), Mr. Abba (S-uperintendent of Schools in Schenectady), and Mr. Dick Roberts (a well-known at- torney). Also attending were Dick Sakala, Director of Athletics, and coaches Bob Magee and John MacNamara. The speeches given had nothing but praise for the outstanding achievements of the soccer team last season. A fine record of 9.,3 was topped by a bid for the NCAA play-offs, in which the team went as far as the. quarter-finals ..

Litwak said the asbestos contamination in most buildings was probably due to flaking of asbestos used in ceiling tile for acoustical ptwposes or aprayed on steel beams to .prevent buckling in case of fire. In 1973 the United States Environ- mental Protection Agency banned the spraying on of asbestos. Walter Hang, a NYPIRG specialist on the subject, agreed that the OSHA standards should be lowered due to the possible scarring of lung tissue as a result of inhaling asbestos.

Dean Kellett explained that the flaking consists of ''plaster and perlite.\ Despite the information obtained; more tests were performed in Sept., 1978, and again on Nov. 20, 1978, as the former tests were taken before stud~nts occupied the dorms and thus weren't accurate samples of the air. by SUSAN BARNHART Educational trends in recent years have shown that part- time education is on the up-. swing. Unbeknownst to many daytime undergraduates at Union, the College is also a part of this growing tr.end. Operating out of Wells House, the Office of Graduate Studies and Con- tinuing Education is playing a large role in the lives of those students who are pursuing their degrees, whether graduate or undergraduate, outside the norms . of the daytime unm dergraduate, The office, under the direction of Dean Aaron Feinsot, is in charge Of overseeing the educationof approximately two thousand students. This is comparable to the present nu:mber of daytime un- . .....dergraduates who presently number approximately two thousand. The Office of Graduate Studies and Con- tinuing Education shoUld be looked upon as a vital part of the Union College community; its students double the present enrolhnent at Union. groups. There are those pur- suingan undergraduate degree, those pursuing a graduate degree and those students in- terested in taking non-credit courses. Dean Feinsot notes that there are approximately five hundred undergraduates pursuing their degrees part-time at Union. There are from seven hundred to eight hundred graduate students, forty to fifty of these are full-time students. In ad- dition, there are nearly a thousand students who take non-credit courses. Course offerings for these students are of a varied nature. Undergraduate degrees may be pursUed in any field that Union offers its daytime un- dergraduates. Graduate students may .pursue a Master's degree in the following areas: There are a small number of Ph.D. candidates also studying at Union. These candidates are earning their Ph.D:s ineitherone of two fields. These fields are Life Sciences and Systems and Administrative Engineering. Dean Feinsot stressed that there are a limited number of students in this program. Currently only five students are pursuing their Ph.D's at Union. Continued on page 9 , .-r, :;:,, . There is no question that the Globetrotters are an American institution. The number of fans who have marvelled at their skill on a basketball floor is now closing in on the 90 million mark. They have performed their unique brand of basketball skill combined with hilarious comedy in more than 1600 cities in North America. This season the Magicians of Basketball will increase to 97 the number of countries they have visited, and for many of those nations, the Trotters were. the first look at the sport of basketball. Often, the Globetrotters' game inspired the formation of national teams, and many countries, including Australia and Israel, give the Globetrotters credit for the creation of Olympic basketball squads in their countries. In addition to spreading the basketball word around the globe. the Trotters have had a tremendous influence on the way in which the g~e is played. Even here in the U.S., basketball experts acknowledge that influence when they describe a tricky pass, or a crowd-pleasing shot, as a \Globetrotter Style\ play. Superb ballhandling, fancy dribbling, pin-point passes behind the back or through the legs, are all examples of the style created by the Globetrotters. The Trotters have even helped shape the charac.: teristics of players in basketball today. It was the Trotters who first asked that all their players be skillful ballhandlers, -even those big men who played on the front line. As a result, all top flight players are able to handle the ball with the skill of a guard. This year's team consists of many new, young ballplayers, all . possessing outstanding basketball skills, which they will use to thrill the Union audience as they take on the Washington !}enerals at 7:30 p;m., Monday, March 12 in the fieldhouse.

Page 2 OONOORDIENSIS, February es, 1979 Editorials Danger In The Air In a few days the College will release, in a report, findings in- dicating the presence of asbe~tos fibers, a known carcinogenic, in the air where dormitories' ceilings have been sprayed with an asbestos-plaster compoWld. The Fox, Davidson, Hickock and Potter dormitories have ceilings covered with the compound. Though the findings pose significant questions as to the safety of certain dormitories, the College community should not exaggerate the hazard to occupant well-being. The report found only a level of .025 fiberS· per cubic centimeter. OSHA (Occupational Health and Safety Administration), the federal agency that sets the acceptable standard for safe expo8ur:e to asbestos, perrnfts the presence of 2.0 fibers per cubic centimeter. Therefore, the level found in the Union dormitories represents only about one percent of the present standards considered safe and permissible. We do not mean to say, however, that the College can ignore the findings nor casually investigate the potential dangers to resident students. Though the level of asbestos poses no immediate threat to the health of dormitory occupants, the College has an obligation (one which we believe they are aware of), to act quickly. Safety standards that are acceptable today may not be so ten or even five years from now. Twenty years ago, the danger of asbestos as a possible cause of lung cancer was not even known. NIOSH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, recently released its report saying that \no level of asbestos can be con- sidered safe.\ Also, present OSHA standards, currently wtder intense criticism, are set at levels designed to prevent asbestosis, a disease iri which asbestos fibers eventually blanket the internal lung tissue. However, lower levels are believed to still contribute to the development of lung cancer. OSHA standards were not set, ,ac- cording to many critics of the agency, with the prevention of cancer in mind. We believe that the College should act immediately. Two prac- tical alternatives are presently available for the College's con- sideration. The ceilings can be completely stripped of the com- pound or the ceilings can be sprayed with a sealant. Becali.Se of the undue cost involved, we suggest the latter, but not without reser- vations. It has become apparent in recent years that the use of certain sealants causes more .problems than it solv~s. Two sealants, however, have proven effective in the past, .and should be considered before any action is initiated. Deeadex Flrecbeck, a bulorubber compound, and Cafco, a vinyl acetate, have been recommended by numerous envirnomental organizations. But, because we are editors and not engineers, we will not attempt to advise the College as to the best possible methods .of solving the present problem. We ohly urge the College Administration to act quickly and the community to cooperate in the effort by not overreacting to the findings of the report. When the question of hwnan health is concerned, immediate and decisive action is needed. Hesitant decision-making can often have disastrous long range consequences.

Melissa Cragin Be Honest the Unsatisfied Women Union College: I have attended Union College for the past four years and have remained silent until now. I lived through the days of the Xavieria, her im- ioo~:net~s. and now the two senior women who want Union men to. be bold. As y()U will see, this letter is not written in the heat of passion, nor in anger at social life at Union. This com· munication is written to the Union College Women from a person wllo could be classified as an expert in the areas . of companionship and love, both of the shallow physical and total commitment natare. Firstly, please don't put the blame on the Union men en· Davidson, and both sororities. I apologize to Smith and MeKean, 'rbe results have been very interesting, to say the least. The average UniDn woman gets caught up very easily in the playing of those tricky little games made famous by some . Victorian prude. Forget them, ladies, they are too easy to see through. Instead, try to mold yourself after the type of women that is now accepted as the leader in America, those that say \yes\ or \oo.\ A yes isntt a com-- mitment either, it is the only way of communicating an in- terest in another person. Most importantly, don't be afraid to take the initiative. I don't mean taking off your clothes inlhe middle of a party either.

Cut Throat Bits And Pieces by STEVE RICHARDS As many of you know, the first candidate for the presidency of Union College will be on campus this Thursday and Friday; the second candidate will visit next Monday and Tuesday. The candidates will meet with students on Feb. 22 (Thursday) and March 1 (Monday) at 4:30 p.m. We have an hour-and-a· half with each of the candidates. Every student is encouraged. to attend. Thmsda.y's meeting will be held in Strauss Lounge and Monday's will be held in Hale House, Lower Lounge. Some words from ot}ler campuses: The Board of Trustees at Dartmouth wHl decide tomorrow whether to abolish fraternities, as recommended by the faculty and a good number of students, or let them be. Middlebury will no longer allow their fraternities to offer dining services -in their houses in an effort to increase patronage of _the on-campus dining facilities. - There is a student labor pool at Duke which saves the university $130 1 000 a year While at the same time creating jobs worth .$200,000 for the students. The students do everything from cleaning up the football stadium aftei\ home games to changing light bulbs to helping a department with clerical work. Have you heard. about saga food services· at Florida State· University? They're roaming the campus with 10 food carts, one featuring fresh fruits and a blender for do4t-yourself liquid -concoctions. Residence hall students may also call in an order and have it delivered to their rooms. According to a . recent beverage indllStry publication, 84 percent of college students use alcoholic beverages (75 percent use distilled liquor, 74 percent beer, and 64 percent wine.) The surv~y says these are the hard li:quor preferences of students: vodka, 54 percent drink; rum, 48 percent; gin, 42 percent; bourbon, 39 percent; tequila, 38 percent; and scotch, 31 percent. A fraternity at Vanderbilt (the A TO's) and the Tennessee Women's Prison held a fraternity-inmate \Swap Dance'' last fall. One of the fraternity organizers called it ''the best dance we ever had.\ Now that's hard up. I don't know What's going on at obtirlin.

I lived through the days of the original Xavieria, her im~ posters, and now the two senior women who want Union men to. be bold. As you will see, this letter is not written in the heat of passion, nor in anger at social life at Union. This com- munication is written to the Union College Women from a person who could be classified as an expert in the areas of companionship and love, both of the shallow physical and total commitment nature. Firstly, please don't put the blame on the Union men en- tirely. Maybe there is some valid point to your argument that Union men fail to- stand up to narmal expectations, but I fail to see this point. Try looking at the admissions process at Union and the male~female ratio for some answers. Secondly, you must realize ·that the long tradition of in· VCJ\vement of . Union men with co-eds at other local schools is hard to overcome in 8 years. Union is a school that thrives on tradition, and probably will for decades to come. But, enough ot this type of discussion, as this is not my specialty. My specialty is love, and all that goes with it. During the past four years, I have \studied\ women in North, Richmond, Fox, Davidson, and both sororities. I apologize to Smith and McKean. The r~sults have been very interesting, to say the least. '1\e average Union woman gets caught up very easily in the playing of those tricky little games made famous by some Victorian prude. Forget them, ladies, they are too easy to see through. Instead, try to mold yourself after the type of women that is now accepted as the leader in America, those that say \yes or \no.\ A yes isn't a com~ mitment either, it is the only way of commwticating an In· terest in another person. Most importantly. don't be afraid to take the initiative. I don't mean taking off y()Uf clothes in the middle of a .party either. Try changing your seat in class t() the one next to the guy you've been dying to ' 1 Kn{JW.\ I'm sure you may be \known\ by him very soon. A smile and stimulating con- versation will help. (Dtm'.t talk about classes. ) Did you ever stop to think that maybe you haven't been making yourself available? How many times have I heard a Union woman say that she was not going to a party because she didn't feel comfortable with a certain crowd. What you missed was the chance to see that same guy you sat next to in class, who is now m~ving in with the girl down the hall. Where do I fit into the Union soeial scene? Most any place that I can get into. The key is the ability to adapt. If you want to com~ to my room for wine, cheese, and music, that can be . arranged. If you are like one Richmond occupant who asked, \Do yott wanna get rough?\ that can also be handled with class. My main point to you, the women of Union College, is that if you want it, ask for it in a tactful way. I realize that my size 3~ hat is now hung on a St. Rose coatrack, but I'm sure that I could handle a few more cases before I leave Union. You don't need to be bold, just honest, open, and ready. Cut Throat 'f.o the Editor, To the cut-throat who STOLE my notebook from the Library . last Saturday . • . Listen, if you need the notes from my; three courses~ why don't you just return it and I'll photostat· the entire damned notebook for you.

If your intent is to screw me, then why don't you just return the notebook and we'll think of a more imaginative way to do it. Chip Beaudet 215D. U. Bits And Pieces by STEVE RICHARDS As many of you know, the first candidate for the presidency of Union College will be on campus this Thursday and Friday; the second candidate will visit next Monday and Tuesday. The candidates will meet with students on Feb. 22 (Thursday) and March 1 (Monday) at 4:30 p.m. We have an hour-and-a- half with each of the candidates. Every student is encouraged to attend. Thursday's meeting will be held in Strauss Lounge and Monday's will be held in Hale House, Lower Lowtge. Some words from other campuses: The Board of Trustees at Dartmouth will decide tomorrow whether to abolish fraternities, as recommended by the faculty and a good number of students, or let them be. Middlebury will no longer allow their fraternities to offer dining services in their houses in an effort to increase patronage of the on-campus dining facilities. There is a student labor pool at Duke which saves the university $130,000 a year while at the same time creating jobs worth $200,000 for the students. The students do everything from cleaning up the football stadium after home games to changing light bulbs to helping a department with clerical work. Have you heard about saga food services at Florida State University? They're roaming the campus with 10 food carts, one featuring fresh fruits and a blender for do-it-yourself liquid concoctions. Residence hall students may also call in an order and have it delivered to their rooms. According to a recent beverage industry publication, 84 percent of college students use alcoholic beverages (75 percent use distilled liquor, 74 percent beer, and 64 percent wine.) The survey says these are the hard liquor preferences of students: vodka, 54 percent drink; rum, 48 percent; gin, 42 percent; bourbon, 39 percent; tequila, 38 percent; and scotch, 31 percent. A fraternity at Vanderbilt (the ATO's) and the Tennessee Women's Prison held a fraternity-inmate \Swap Dance\ last fall. One of the fraternity organizers called it \the best dance we ever had.\ Now that's hard up. I don't know what's going on at Oberlin. They have organized a \crisis committee\ to deal. with \an unusually high number of sexual harrassment and vandalism cases.\ And last fall a \communal moan\ found students, administrato..rs and townspeople alike gathering at near midnight to howl away their anxieties. The event was orchestrated by a conductor. Since many students at Penn State rent refrigerators, housing officials there are considering putting one in each room and raising room rates by $10 per term. The Gay Student Association at Dartmouth has asked the IFC there to pass a resolution pledging not to discriminate against homosexuals in the selection of members. Gays will be included for the first time this year in the Ohio State U. student government computer date -match. The highly suc- cessftd event normally draws s~veral thousand participants. They may be drilling for oil and gas on the UCLA campus soon. Word has it they're conducting an environmental impact stUdy on the effects of oil and gas exploration on campus. By the way, the third presidential candidate to visit the campus will arrive Thur- sday, March 1. Students will meet him that Thursday at 4:30 p.m. in Strauss Lowtge. I will remind you with posters and the like. Elections for the Editorship positions of Concordiensis wHI be held Tuesday, Feb, 27.

OONOORDIENSIS, February 2S, 19\19 Letters To the Editor, On Wednesday, Feb. 14t the organizers of the Dreadful Greed Party met to discuss the latest restrictions imposed upon . by the college at:J.. mirtista·atic)n Up to that point Dreadful Greed CtJrwoittee been meeting these restric:ti<ltl.S and regulations on ru>:l;riV a daily basis. We had most sincerely trying to the party running smoothly with the consent of those College authorities responsible for such activities as we had All previous con- cessions had been made in good spirit, although the financial burden was growing heavier with each requirement. . On Feb. 14, however, the people have very little. outlet for such creative1'ibilities at Union. There is no forum fo1· their expression here. Dreadful Greed was created with this in mind. These people sought us out and we sought them out. Besides the aforementioned talents, there were clowns, jugglers, artists, actors in the theater of the absurd, human marinettes, mimes, sound specialists, special effectS people, and many more. Where else. and through what other means could such creative talentS assemble? At Union Colleg~. with .its stereotypical cocktail pm:ties and beer blasts, one party runs into another in a seemingly endle:ss routine which can sometimes border on monotony. Dreadful Greed was not only an exception to this routirie, but was outside the routine -itself. tfle,;·.o:pinion,•of.;.,many: is, .' .• ,, eellwit!~i'td'fic~~rs,,tthlQf!'lin·· · \' - .·~tltJgttes~·· ttl,.··endure ·at .. Union, . involved with Dreadful \Greed feel that it is indeed an un- fortunate situation when the administration refuses to see the need for expression of creative thought beyond in- stitutional means. But it is n<Jt only their refusal to see this need that upsets us_ but their actual attempts and success at suppressing alternate forms of creativity. It is a sad state of affairs when a liberal arts in· sitution takes measures to suppress the very energies which it purports to encourage. We only hOJX! that the futtire will again bring a change and at least allow those with special creative abilities to express those abilities and allow others to enj<>y that expression. · Thankyou, The Dreadful Greed Committee Union Views: Please Help To the Editor: On February 4,1979, the home of Hal MacBride, a mechanic of Unim')'s Maintenance crew for the . past 32 years, was com· pletely destroyed by fire. He and his family of eight children are dispersed presently among several hon1es throughout the Schenectady area; their only remaining possessions are the clothes on their backs. Unfortunately, Mr. MacBride had .lo fire insurance on his house and has no significant savings accumulated. ..At this time, several people have initiated a fund drive on the Union campus for money to provide the MacBrides with food and clothing during this difficult period. In order to supplement the efforts Gf the Union community, Theta Delta Chi Fraternity and Delta Gamma Sorority have decided to donate the proceeds (){ our joint band party this Friday night in the Old Chapel to the MacBride family. We will charge a non1inal 50 cents fee at the door (additional donations will be accepted gladly) -for which we will provide all the beer you can consume and Union's own fine band. Sticky Wicket. We hope that the Union student body will join us in this effort.

Their involvement attendance, their eniov.rne11t by JIM DAVIS Probably the most notable aspect of the Union student body is its homogeneity. Some 70 percent of the students here call New York State horne and only a handful hail from anywhere outside of the Nor- theastern U.S. Depending on who you speak to, this fact is either comforting or distressing. Those in the former group point to the similarities that exist in students' backgrounds and add that this n1akes it far easier to strike up friendships. Those in the second camp note that the purpose of going to college is to broaden oneself, both intellectually and socially. Having everyone come from the same kind of neighborhood makes that tough to do. I'd put myself in the second group. But it's not out of any unsupported bias. I love New York as much as the next person. What upsets me about the distribution of Union's student population-which some people scoffingly compare to that of Nassau Community College and in fact probably isn't much different than most Union students' high schools-is that it seems to foster the same kind of fragmentation you found in high school. Back then, they were called \cliques and it's probably true that they're not nearly so rigid or well-defined here. But the fact remains that they do exist. From personal ex- perience and conversations with others, I've found that students here have a precious few n1onths at the beginning of their freshman year to cut an image for themselves-a mold that will detennine what people they will come in contact with and what experiences they'll have for the ren1ainder of their days as Union students. All of this has led some people to conclude that the students ';~re are an apathetic, unin· volved group. I don't agree. Son1e students here are quite talented. And through various campus activities such as Mountebanks, intercollegiate athletics, and the newspaper you're reading now, they display ttreir skills. When you come down to the bottom line, the problem is that students aren't very supportive of campus activities. As a V.P.Candidate Platforms MUR_RAY LEVISON As is usually the case, elec- tions to fill vacancies are mildly publicized and poorly attended. Yet the candidates still have the obligation to try to inform as many people as possible and get as many of those to the polls. I certainly don't want to be accused of sneaking by anyone, so read on. I have chosen to rWl for Vice- President of the Student Body. This is for one main reason-! want the challenge and responsibility the position brings with it. The Vice-President spends most of his time as Chairman of the Committee on Committees ( COC). As a very active member of the COC for the last year and a half, I know the move to chairman will be ac- complished easily and with very positive results. As I'm sure any current or past COC member will tell you, my dedication to hard work, to as fair a com- mittee selection process as possible, and to planning for the future, is second to none. I know I can handle the responsibility. This has been proven in almost three years service on the College Senate and Student Forwn, my time on the COC and my service on this year's Search Comn1ittee for the Dean of Admissions. The only added responsibility would be as chairman of the COC, a body with which I have ex- perience in its operation and in the formulation of its current policy guidelines. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone. I don't have to. I know what kind of work I'm capable of doing, and so do many of you. I believe I've proven n1yself time and time again over the last three-and-a- half years. I know I can do a first-rate job, and I will. At midyear, especially in a year like we're experiencing, . it's very difficult to spew out stands on issues. What I will commit myself to is doing what is best for Union College as a whole in planning for its future- in all aspects-with a special view towards seeing to it that students' interests are ar- ticulated and maintained. I welcome your comments and support on this and any other n1atter. Than you. - JEFF CAPELLE One of the more disturbing aspects of student government here at Union is the lack of a fresh perspective each year. Too many times students pass through the . ranks of the government system, with the only new ideas being brought in by freshmen. As a sophomore who has not been caught up in the inner workings of the school, I have had a chance to look at Union for what it is, and have been able to retain a real per- spective of student life and sentiment on campus. At this time, with the review of the governance structure it is especially important that new ideas are brought in, and potentially different viewpoints are heard. Obviously, the most im- portant function of the Vice President, for the remainder of the year, is overseeing com- mittee appointments as Chairman of C.o.C. Not being a member of the traditional power structure of the campus, I have few political ties and will hopefully be able to run a committee selection process with a degree of fairness that has not been apparent in recent years. In addition, it is im- portant to have an un- derclassman as Vice President so that next year, he can be held accountable for those com- mittee appointments. I still have more than two years left at Union, and if elected will do my best to make then1 productive and enjoyable for all of Union students. student here, it's em- barrassingly obvious to me-and I'm as much at fault as anyone. This lack of support n1anifests itself in a number of ways: in the ridiculously small audiences that usually attend a glee club concert or a football or basketball game, in the number of people who bother to read anythL'lg besides the personals in this newspaper, or in the general lack of a shared, common experience among the student body. I think the only way this can be explained is to cite a certain sense of uninvolvement among students. Apparently, most everyone is too concerned with either studying so that they can get into graduate school and get a good job or going ollt to parties. In short, people are too concerned with themselves to bother to spend some time to support other campus ac- tivities. I talked about this one evening last week with a senior who happens to be more in- volved and supportive of College goings-on than most. He said that while these things may be true now, they need not be so in the future. In noting this, he referred to the importance of the on-going searches for a permanent College president and Dean of Admissions. For it's the dean who will have the power to select the kind of student body that will be n1ore diverse and open to new ideas and endeavors. And it's the President who will be able to take the lead in creating the sort of conditions that will be responsive to at least giving these new direc- tions a chance. So the selection of these two individuals is a vital matter that all members of the Union community should take an interest in. Whoever is named to these positions will have a big job. They shouldn't be expected, however, to solve all of the College's shortcomings by themselves; that's the job of everyone who contributes to the College's functioning. But it's in their hands that Union's future direction lies. It's up to them to design the framework from which n1embers of the College com- munity can build the reputation Union rightfully deserves as ()ne of America's finest institlltions of higher education.

Page4 OONOORD.IENSLS 1 February 22, 1979 Student Life Committee Chairman Prof. John Sowa. byJIMDAVIS Irnagille a grain of dust in a Kansas wheatfield. ~ow compare it to tlle entire Umted States. In his lecture here last Thursday evening, Dr. J~ Allen Hynek, one of the world's leading authorities on unidentified flying objects (UFOs ), said that's the relatioBship that exists between the 'earth and the entire universe.· He noted that there are billions of stars in each galaxy. Many of these stars, hEJ believes, must have planets circling around them. \The universe is teeming with life,\ he asserted. \UFOS are a real phenomenon. We are not alone.\ Dr. Hynek told his audience, which filled about half of Memorial Chapel, that he \started as a complete skep-- tic,\ working for the Air Force in the 1940s. \I thought UFOs were a fad.\ he recalled, \But after awhile, l realized I coUld no longer call the people who reported them fools. I couldn't deny the volume of their reports.\ To respond to sightings, Dr. Hynek helped establish the Center for UFO Studies in 1973 to \serve as an international clearinghouse for the receipt and investigation of UFO reports.\ The center publishes its findings in a monthly newsletter, • the International UFO Reporter. . UFO sightings come in waves, Dr. Hynek said last Thursday 7 likening them to meteor showers. The last such period in the 1J.S. came in 1973., when hundreds of UFOs were sighted in the Southwest. ''UFOs are a global phenomenon,\ he said; \We keep track of the sightings reported to the Center for UFO studies and have about 751000 reports .. from, 133· countries. Among these are 1,300 physical sightings.'' The most recent wave of reports appears to be coming from around Australia, Dr. noted. Last November an aircraft pilot radioed that he was being followed by .a strange craft ~nd several minutes later he disappeared. Around Christmas, a number of UFOs were sighted by pilots and tracked on radar around New Zealand. . Dr. Hynek served as technical director of the 1977 film ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' Although he noted that it was · produced \as entertainment, · not a docllmentary,\ he also said tbat a number of events depicted in the film, such as. beams .of light eminating from strange objects and mailboxes shaking in their presence, have been reported. \I was impressed with the technical knowledge the producers of the movie showed about UFOs,\ he said. Since its release, Dr. Hynek reported that people don't seem so reluctant to · report UFO sightings. \It's not a socially repelling thing anymore.

We also have Nina Stengle, Demetra Pontsakes, Natalie Barandes, David Van Wess, Chip Baker, Ray ~asse, Melissa Gold, Judy Rosenthal, and Randy Klein to complete the. ensemble af bizarre characters. For a change of scenery, we have covered Nott Memorial's arena area- witha floral design. Charles Steckler transfers the design of an 18th century cir- cular tableau of American needlework to the floor. · The characters walk and -dance on history as they flash back in time. This traditional work. of embroidery _ is_ nillned ''Wreath of Flowers.'' The life and joy of our semi-histo.-ical spoof is expressed right down tQ the grpund the characters walk and d~nce on. The floor has been plotted and designed by Judy Kottke, and Sue Teitelbaum, who have contributed a good deal of ar- tistic e~pression to their technical execution. The stage set transforms from a public inn, to an ostentations ·plantation, to the backwoods during the course of the play. The ensemble por· \ trays the scene changes hy i posing as background scenery ~ with the help of various props, ~ ''The Robber Bridegroom\ is o:: coherently organized down to E the most minute detail.

A scene from ''ltle Robber Bridegroom.\ Left to right: Nina Stenge-l as Raven, Geqrge Ward as Little Har.p, Char:les Sommer as Big Harp, the Beatles by PURE BOB BLAKE Well, I personally had a greflt time last weekend going -on a date witb my girlfriend Betty Lou to the Slea2;y Lane motel in Niagara Falls; .for their first annual \Why Don't We Do It In The Winter\ Weekend! Despite the swell time I had doing un- mentionable things with Betty Lou, upon my return my roommate, Hans Lipshitz, a transfer -from Nepal, told me of a great new group that some radio station was plugging. He told me be thought they were brand new,.and he liked them.so much be went out and bought their first album. Ever since, he has been playing this record non-stop and he wanted me to review it. So, Hans, here it is. Tbe alb11m is called \Meet the Beatles\ and 1 must say it sucks'! I mean it really blows! I mean you can take this albQm and shove it in one orifice and pull it out another, and it will still sound just as good. The ·only thing I can compliment this band on is that the're narned after an insect that is as an- noying and repulsive as their music. Musically these guys not only can't play their instrwnents, butthey _can barely write a song that -:lasts ov.er two minutes. Besides .the music being awful (and I use the term ''music\ loosely) their lyrics. are just as bad. Their songs are all hedonistic odes to their girlfriends. Furthermore, they're so unbelievably op- timistic that these guys must be on drugs. The four degenerates in this .band all hail from Hollywood, California, despite what the sleeve· credits say. They per· form in these hideous sport jackets with no collars that not even the Salvation Army would . take. The only .previous ex• perience they have had is that they all played. at one time or another on the · new defunct I ·can not help being ~used And a trifle bit .surprised Those things yousaid to me ... I knew they all were lies. Klaatu. In my final opinion this is just another piss .. poor punk band with absolutely no commercial potential. So no matter what anyone else says, this group stinks because I said so, and I am NEVER wrong. Why can't people play like Benny Good· man anymore? What perfect excuses our minds can find For doing what we do wring \The Lord 'i'hefe is an inherent problem with making a film based on a fantasy; if yog make it real by puttingit on the screen, then, by definition, it's no longer fan- tasy.

Certainly there are the usual difficulties with animated characters that previously existed only in men's minds. You get used to that after t~n minutes.

All students are encouraged to attend. by PEGGY O'ROURKE Yes, Trivia is back! That all- time UC favorite is here once .again to lift your weary, winter term spirits · to an incredible high; Trivia h::1s\ · become a tradition here at Union, and this year will be no ex;ception. There will be three shows' from 10: 00- 12:00 p.m. on Monday, Feb. 26, Thursday, March I, and Monday, Marcb 5. All you have to do to participate is organize a team from your floor, frater- nity' .. sorority' or off-campus crowd and call in your answers. It's easy, fUQ, and there's no registration to bother with. During each show 100 trivial qu~stimons will be asked, each of which your team will attempt' to. answer by calling 370o6151 or 370-6154. And while you fran- tically dial the phone, there will be mu51c played to encourage, entice, and entertain you. The first t.eam to ans.wer the question correctly wins l point, Wlless of course, the question is, in trivia terms, a 'stumper' which no ontns able to answer. at the end of each game the points aretallied and each team is notified of their standing. Aiso, a 5-point bonus question is announced that will be the first question of the next shOw.. An industrious team can research the question and be assured of victory, if they are quick with their fingers on the dial. There ~ate motives to playing Trivia . besides a cleiUl, wholesome, g!>od time and that is beer. Yes, that's right; if at the end of the third game you are the winning- team, you will receive as your due two lh-ke'gs. And if you · come in second place the reward is one ~-keg. These kegs are being donated by Dean Kellet, the Dutch Hollow Pub, and WRUC studio. Ifyou're a new hand at Trivia or if you had some problems last year, here are a few time- honored hints to success. First, and most important of aU, keep trying! Even if you don't know ·the answer when you dial, divine _inspiration may in· tercede whiie you talk to the operator. Another good idea is to keep a lot of books aroWld. For example The Gufnness Book of World Records or even a dictionary can be helpful. To r~ch the station mote quickly dia16-1-5 as the question is being read and then add the 1 or 4 after it is finished. The right answer is no good if you tell it to a busy signal. If you are wrong, get off the phone as quickly as · possible. to give others a chance; Cheaters never prosper. And the last recom- mendation - enjoy yourself, have a ball, and remember you're no.1 if you're havin' fun! Triv·ia has always been welcome at Union College winter term, so get psyched if you played last year and try it out if you're a newcomer. Organize your teams, leave your books for a couple of hours, and tune in to WRUC, 90.9 on your FM dial, this Monday night at 10:00 p.m. It's what you've been waiting for - Trivia. •

Student Life byPAM RYAN The Student Life Committee is now evaluating the programs and services currently available to students at Union. The purpose of this review is to determine which programs and services are deemed most important by students and how they rate the quality of these programs. From this evaluation the com.mittee will assess the needs of individual programs . and services, and determine where the committee should direct its energies. . The committee has compiled · a questionnaire that has been . given to RA's and fraternity and sorority presidents to distribute . to on-campllS students. Off- campus students will receive the survey in their campus mailboxes. All students are requested to carefully reaa- and · fill out the questionnaire and return it to the Dean of Student's office or the Student Activities Office .by Feb. 29. The purpose of the questionnaire is to evaluate student affairs programs, not student affairs personnel. Students are requested to rate the significance of the various programs and activities, and then separately rate the quality of each. The results will then be computer scored and evaluated for more efficient tJSe of the data. Information gathered from the questionnaire will be used for a number of purposes. It will be sent to the Middle States Committee on Student Life and used to develop recom- mendations for future policies · and programs. The data will also be used by the Student Life Committee and various other coriunittees to determine to which areas energies should be directed. The Dean of Student's Office will also use this information for budgeting purposes by helping to determine wh~re resources should be directed. The information gathered from this questionnaire will be used to make decisions that will affect the entire college com· niunity.

IFC Update byDAN BOOTH Fifteen members pf the Interfraternity-Council, for- merly the Pan-Hellinic Colli1cil, met on Feb. 13 to discuss a new . constitution. Hitherto the council had no written con- stitution. The proposed constitution -and its by4aws are a combination of laws from other college council's constitutions.- The major change will be the for- mation of a conduct committee, which will discipline its own members ''and recommend discipline to t)le appropriate body for fraternities-sororities that violate these rules.'' , The committee will have Six members: the Assistant Dean of Students, the President Qf the IFC, the Vice-President of the IFC, and three other coun~il members. The IFC will vote on whether to accept this new constitution on Feb-: 27. Also included in the proposed constitution are provision stiffening requirements for members' attendance at weekly Council meeting-s. - Concerning the body's .name change from the Pan-Hellinic, Council back to the IFC, which had been its name until last · year, Vice President Carmen Saginario said, \We did it to ·conform with the national bodies.\ He explained that the PHC is the governing body for sororities. \When two sororities were charted here, we thought the national PHC would gain jurisdiction. But the IFC also · sets policy · for colleges with~ . both fraternities and sororities.\ The creation of the Council · Conduct Committee, he added, \should help clea~: up problems in a lot of areas - both among Greek groups and between them and independents~', The next meeting of the IFC will be Feb. 20 at 7:30 p.m. at the IFC room in Carnegie Hall. PREPARE FOR:· Our· · 4·1stJ] by CAROLE REINIG The past few days have been unusually busy . at the . Placement Office, This week . was the · start of the one-day . internst:tip program, whic;h · began yesterday. Yingwa Min of the Placement Office termed -student reaction . a 1 'success.\ The turnout totalled 51 students who have been assigned to spend a day with 22 Unionealwnni volunteers in the Albany-Troy _area. The volunteers came from career backgrounds such as business, art, health, .govern- ment, mass media and law. According to Mrs. Min, the - Qne-day internship program offers students an excellent opportunity to s-pend a day · observing. the career of tb.eir choice. This provides a hvo-foid purpose: first, it allows · students to gain exposure in the field 41. which tlley may pursue a career, and second, it allows students to develop personal contacts outside the College. The iaea of the one-day in- ternships is gaining popularity at other colleges as well. The response to tl)ese programs has been one of greatenthusiasm .as college students, past and present, are brought together in a \realistic appreciation'' of the true meaning of different careers. In a recent Union College news bulletin sent to alumni to solicit their time and aid in thls program, it was noted that the - alumni \are far and away the best resource the College has at its disposal for helping Union students develop this ap- preciation.'' Pending the success of· this year's program, it is hoped that another will take place in the near future involving members of the Schenectady alumni. Placement Director, Betty Goodman outlined the tentative plans for sometime in March. If held, she hopes that as many or more students would be able to participate. Mrs. Goodman stressed that the program is open to all students. · Modern China Students interested in lear- ning ..:..more about Chinese history and culture will get a chance.to spring term, when a course in modern Chinese civilization will be offe~ed. The course, which wiU study ·China during the period beginning in the 18th Century until the 1950s, will be taught by Prof. Sam Chung-Sang Suen who begi:m teaching here this fall and is now teaching a course in ancient Chinese civilization. He said that his spring course will concentrate on the study of Chinese civilization through literary debates.

KIMBEBI...EY Less senior Pete Felker, undefeated in the 167 ;pound weight class. with a record of 8- 0, wrestling coach Mi,ke Paquette and histeam will head this afternoon for New York Maritime, site of the qualifying match for the Nationals to be Mld March 2 and 3 in Humi>oldt, California. Saturday night the team will return to Schenectady having competed against 18 division III teams, and bearl.ng, if Paqpette's expectatio11s are fulfi.lled, five or six triumphant seniors. ' Felker, out with cellulitis. will enter the hospital_ on Friday to have an abcess scraped The injury·is the result of a mat burn won in practice which later became ·infected. Paq11ette expects Pete to be out of action for three-or four wee~s. For the third year in a row Felker will miss the Nationals due to in- juries; two years ago a bad knee was the spoiler, last year a cauliflower ear, and now this. Dave Ward, 3-2 on the season, will replace Felker at 167. \He's in really good shape, and he pushes all the time. George is looking real good.\ \George\ is George Redder, who, with an 11-1 record, Paquette favors to represent Union at the Nationals in the 142 potmd weight Class. Cliff Farrell lost his first match ofthe season, never to be beaten again (Farrell defeated the very same opponent later in the season.) Indicative of Farrell's talent is a match which he neither won nor lost,. but tied: against Division I Colgate, he forced Joe Belllchi, who carried a 17-2 record at the time, to a stalemate. Farrell's season record for the seas()n is 11-1-1 in the 158 polind weight class. Although Cliff missed a couple days training last week because of a back injury sustained in practice, Paq11ette suspects that his condition \ ... should be good enough to carry him through the Qualifiers 1 have him .do well there, and by the time the Nationals come around, he'll be in really good con- dition . . . maybe place in those, too.\ With an 11-1 record at 177, and a second place finish behind an opponent from Division l Rhode Island University in the Springfield Open, captain Josh Salzmann looks sharp. Says Paquette of his man: \Josh has been wrestling really tough, really well. He does alot of work on his own, too, as .far as lifting and runniRg. Before the season, he used tC~ .run seven miles every day.\ Accordi.ng to Paquette, when in early season, Salzmann cut his mileage to four per day, the members of the team who followed the leader complained about running even the reduced amount. Salzmann must be sharp. With 4 wins and 2 losses, previous experience in the Nationals, and 190 pounds, Matt van Benthem gtyes backers reason to expect fuig things of him. Coach Paquette touts van Benthem, saying that Matt \wrestles really hard in practice,\ and that in league competition, \ . . . he's beaten some really good kids.\ Van Benthem won three matches in the Nationals last year, beating an opponent from Humboldt College, who, in turn, beat the New York State champ. Matt lost to him earlier in the season. Recounting this anomaly prompted Paquette to conjecture that \You get good competition. You really don't know who's going to win tmtil the day of the match. It's who's tough that day, who ~s feeling good ... It doesn't matter who won earlier in the season.\ Dan Tannenbaum, 7-4 this year, will represent Union in the Qualifiers in the heavyweight slot. To train for the qualifying match, Tannenbawn has been running twenty sets of stairs - daily in addition to· the usual practice rigors. \He could be a sleeper,\ Paquette says \ . . . and de really well in the Nationals.\ . Also competing this weekend are freslunen Fred Brown and Jack Donahue, wrestling at 126 and 118 pounds respectively. Brown tends to be a strong candidate for a wild card spot - the coaches of the 18 teams choose to go to the Nationals a wrestler who did not win, but S'PORTS QUIZ Name the Union hoeper who holds the .single season· assists mark? ·~L-vL6L u1 9tL 'ApowJe::> 11!8 :·sNv 'cmt Farrell, 11-l-1 looks toward the Nationals. who nevertheless deserved to go - at the Qualifiers.

Leading scorer, Sheila O'Donnell Women Cagers Go To States by KEVIN TAYLOR and JAY MacDEMOTr February 16th marked the beginning of a strenuous four game set for the women's Varsity basketball team. Having soundly beaten RPI the previous Monday, 53-40. the Dutchwomen anticipat~d an exciting match against North Adams on Thursday in which the Dutchwomen triumphed 53- 47. Both te.ams were well- matcl}ed and due to confident shooting by Sheila O'Donnell, Carol Wrenn and Debbie Sears, in addition to Union's domination of the boards, particularly cleaning up on the offensive· rebounds, Union took the match. This success carried the Dutchwomen into a Friday evening match with Elmira, making the first game of a 3-day weekend tournament at Siena. Defensively Union was sharp and aggressive in. a zone, causing a low Elmira score. Unfortunately the field goal success for Union was not as dependable. But Sears and O'Donnell carried the scoring effort with 10 points and 16 points, respectively,' and Liz Yaeger and Deb Sears con- stituated the power under the boards with 10 and 11 rebounds. Union topped Elmira. com- peting a 3-day winning streak securing & 10-3 record. Saturday, the D11tchwomen attended. their usual team meal at the Pub at 3:00, and over a dessert of cling peaches, prepared themselves for one of the most challenging matches ever to be played\ by any Uniq,n women's basketball team in J. V. Hoopers Up Record To 6-4 by BILL CURTIN Again Union's JV basketball team played very well this past week. Unfortunately they suffered a heartbreaking defeat at the hands of Yale last Tuesday and then subdued Albany State at Memorial Fieldhouse on Saturday. The Dutchmen, playing the best they have this year, went to New Haven, Connecticut hoping to pull out a big win against the Division I Elis. Union went up 35-34 at halftime behind the strong play of Mike Canning. The second half was a nip and tuck battle with each team exchanging the lead several times. Union went up 65~1 with just over four minutes left. but could not hold off Yale's final surge losing 74-68. The hack line; facing the tallest op- ponents yet this year, -did a fine . 464 State St. we deliver job during most ()f tbe game limiting the Elis to one shot. Union was led by Joe Uuegas ~with 25 points. The Garnet made it a sweep of Albany State for tbe season with a dominating 80-70 win. The Dutchmen came ()Ut and set the tempo right away as they went up by 10 in the early moments and were never really threatened throughout the contest. Again the front line of Union had an outstanding game. They were led by Bruce Jakie! with 28 points while Seth Mendelowit~ and Joe Uvegas chipped in 16. Two nights ago, Union hosted another Division I school in Siena. Tonight they play at Albany Junior at 7 :3() and will conclude the season on Tuesday against rival RPI. Be sure you catch that one! Schenectacly 374-1S88 history. It was to prove to be a most disturbing encounter. Since 'benefits reaped from such a contest are often im- measurable, incapable of being fully represented by the language of statistics, we have sought to avoid public deception and have withheld the final score of this humbling ex- perience. Union's .only post- contest remarks were, \Siena's club has seen some im- t \ provem~n ... Arising on Sunday morning with 2 percent of energy remaining, the Dutchwomen returned to the scene of the previous night's debacle with the intentions of playing a strong game of basketball against a tough club from LeMoyne. For those who had missed Union's performance against Siena, the Union women provided a 20 minute repeat performance against LeMoyne in a consolation game, demonstrating 101 ways in which one can turn over the ball. At halftime the score had a sobering .effect on everyone in maroon as Union found themselves down by 24 pts. to a less-than-great team. The . Dutchwomen returned the secon~ half with a highly ag,gressive man-to-man defense. This effort afforded· several turnovers which the Dutchwomen were able to capitalize on, combined with much better pass-work and movement up top, the Dut- chwomen creeped the score up to 46-48, losing only by 2 pts. High scorers were Andrea Bowers, Sandi Key and Deb Sears with 14, 10 and 10 pts. respectively. The Women's V~rsity Basketball Team has · been given a bid to participate in the Division III NYSAIA W State Basketball Tournament, to be held at Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y. New York State is one of the first states to have a Division III basketball tournament for women. Thirty-two colleges claimed a Division III status this year. Out of these 32 schools, 8 were selected for the tournament. Union has been seeded 7th in the tourney, to be matched against 2nd seeded William Smith College on Friday, February 23rd at 9:00 p.m. ' other colleges participating Will be Manhattenville College, St. Lawrence, Russell Sage, Buffalo State, Stoney Brook, and Geneseo.

. ' Page 12 OONOORDIENSlS, February 2~, 1979 5port5 Skaters In losing Skid by MATT KAYNE The Union College Sk_ating Dutchmen squared off against the Red Dragons of Cortland State in an FCAC Division II hockey game here at Achilles Rink on this past Thursday, February 15. The crowd, though vociferou~ at times, was a meager and unimpressive 1,019 .. The Red Dragans, sporting a pre-game record of 1-11 in Division II and 3-15 in overall play, seemed to be an even match with the Skating Dut- chmen, whose record prior to the game was 5-16 in Division II play. In the nets for Cortland State was second-string goalie, Tim Anderson; for Union Dave Josephson was making an at· tempt to better his record. As play began, it was end to end action by both sides, but typically sloppy play by the Dutchmen. At the 15:52 mark of the first period, the Red Dragons managed to squeak a rebound shop by Union Goalie Josephson--Dan O'Sullivan from Matt Corkey and Steve Crabb. ·The goal came while Union was shorthanded. The teamswent into their respective dressing rooms with Cortland ·up 1-0. The second period was full of action-both teams flew out of their dressing rooms much like horses fly out of starting gates. Play was quiet and tempered at times, but at others it was fast, Feb. 22- 28 VAR.BASKETBALL J.V.

The loss put Potsdam at 19-4 for the season. The Dutchmen started off slowly and trailed·28-13 with 10 minutes left in the first half. The Golden Bears were repeatedly getting open underneath for easy layups and employed a stiff zone defense which the Garnet could not figure out. Despite this, however, Potsdam guard Jack Bisseta was ap- parently not happy. Shortly after Joe Cardany blew by him for a floating jump shot, the hotm headed Bisseta suddenly punched Cardany in the face. Bisseta was immediately ejected and the incident seemed to spark the Dutchmen and the crowd, especially after Greg Sobocinski hit the resultant two free throws, the consequence of the flagrant technical foul. The Garnet were down· only 44-36 at half. Cardany had 15 of those 36. Union continued to play catch-up ball in the second half and still found themselves down just 2-4 points most of the way. It wasn't until diffiinutive Mike Canning connected on a 20ft. set shot and followed that up by forcing an errant pass ·by Potsdam, picking up the loose ball and racing down court with a layup that pulled Union to within one, 65-64, with 5:45 remaining. Potsdam im- mediately employed a stall game and it wasn't until there were just 41 seconds left that Union fouled. The Bear's Terry Hunter hit both ends of a one- and-one to put Potsdam back up by 3. But Greg Sobocinski quickly canned a 23 ft. bomb from the wing to pull the Dut- chmen within one. However, Union was forced to foul; and with :09left, Potsdam's leading free throw shooter, Ed \Disco\ Jachim was sent to the charity stripe. Jachim, sporting a T- shirt underneath his uniform ala Dale Shackleford of Syracuse, missed the front end of a one-and-one, the first free attempt he had missed· in his last 49 tries, including 8 str~ight in the first half. The rebounded foul shot was quickly outletted to Joe Cardany who dribbled the length of the court, and in storybook fashion tossed 'in the winning basket as time ran out. It was Union's biggest win of the season. Cardany finished with 27 points and Sobocinski not- ched 12 markers. But it was the inspired play of Chris Walsh, Steve Abba, and· Mike Canning that made the real difference ..... Between them they shot 8-13 from the floor, had nine rebounds and 3 steals. The victory was truly a team effort. Several team members thought the crowd was the key motivating force behind their Herculean effort. Encouraged by a free keg of beer offer to the most spirited cheering group, the crowd, certainly the loudest of the year, continually supplied the decibels needed to rattle the opposing team and give our players added incentive. Earlier this past week Union lost to division-! Yale 78-54. The Gamet played well the first half, but the much taller Eli's, featuring two 6 feet 8 inch starters, wore the Dutchmen down in the second half. , Last Thursday at Hartwick, Union again played good ball. - But the division II 6th-ranked nationally Warriors pulled away from a 34-30 lead with 8:21 left to win 61-40. · Union hosted Rochester Tuesday night and .travels to Boston this weekend to take on Babson and Tufts.

While Cortland State scored three times in the period, Union tallied twice-the first a pretty one by Sophomore BiU Mason from Mark Haley, and the second, scored by Jim Anderson from Mike O'Connell and Bill Wall. The score at the end of two; Cortland State 4, Union 2. The third period began where the second had left off-end to end play with many scoring opportunities, but no goals. ~ Midway through the .period a .t 2:00 penal~y was slapped on ~ defenseman Brian Campbell of t' Cortland for interference on ~ Union's Bill Wall. The Dut- ·,.. chmen fired at will at the ~ Cortland net, but when .the l -. penalty was up, they had falled ·~· to score. Three minutes later Mickey Locke scored a breakaway goal-l]is third goal of the night-lifting Cortland to a 5-2 edge. Frosh standout Jim Josephson The game finished with Cortland on top, 5-2. One bright spot for Union was the shots on net that the Skating Dutchmen did manage to tally. They fited 39 1 while Cortland managed only 28. In the game Brian Shea, Mike O'Connell, Dean Mathewson, Bill Mason, and Jim Josephson continued their strong~play. In other games this week the Dutchmen lost two heart- breakers.

Track: Team To Beat by MARK CHADORJIAN and ALLAN MALHO Over the past five years, the Union College track team has proven to be one of best in New York State intercollegiate track. Friday night Union established themselves as being the team to beat this year by defeating archrivals Albany and Plattsburg, raising the season's log to 10-2. Coach Chuck James was impressed by his team's desire as well as the fact that this years team has shown more depth than in previous seasons. James, singled out Darryl Logan (5. 7 in the 50 yd on a sore ankle), Bryan Liss (1st place in the 880 yd, 1:59.6), Dave Rohwasser (2nd in the 880 yd, 2:00), John Smith (1st in the shot put, 40 feet 7 inches), Henry Wright ( 43 feet 9 inches in the triple jwnp, 20 feet 6 inches in the long jwnp both for third . place), Peter Vielkind (2nd in the 600 yd, 1: 16.7) Jack Conner (4:34 at his first attempt at the mile run this year) as well as shot putter Bob Pavacic and burkler Marc Nazon, who both finished second in their respective captain Kevin Scheuer In the l,OOQ yard run. events . Union dominated the meet as Cliff Rodgers won the high jump with his final attemp at 6 feet 4112 inches, which was his personal best for ·the season. Earl €hilton continued his unbeaten . string in the triple jump with a leap of 46 feet 8 inches, and came in second in the long jump with a 20 feet 11 inches distance. The Columbus, Ohio senior then displayed his versatility with a six: foot effort in the high jump. Another un· defeated performer is high hurdler Matt Blum, who won his specialty in 7.1 seconds. Also undefeated, Matt Guilfoyle set th~ pace from the start to finish in the 440 yd with a 51.4 second clocking. Guilfoyle has been running well all season, determined to avenge his disqy.alification in last year's state meet. .Finally, captain Kevin Scheuer produced yet another out standing effort in 1000 yd event. Attempting to qualify for the Division I indoor nationals, Kevin was challenged in the early part of the race but' then pulled away to set a new Union College fieldhouse record with a 2 i 11.3, which was just shy of qualification. Next week the Putcbmen travel to RPI, and in two weeks 'host the Union Invitational. As the state meet (which also will be held at Union on March 171 approaches, ten members have already qualified While others still have good shots at qualifying. Four Dutchmen (Scheuer, Blum, Guilfoyle and Chilton) have also qualified fotthe prestigeous IC4A meet at Princeton.
