The task is one we do not relish, :for statement of ideals is like1y to set a standard which the new board may be unable to maintain, and comparison of ideals a.nd accomplishments is too often odious. Some statement .of what we shall attempt to do, however, is necessary to enabl~ the Student body and other readers to interp:r.e,t and understand our actions.

H. F. K. COOPERATION THE work begun upon the land north of Alexander field in· order to level the spot and convert it into an additional athletic field marks the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the faculty and the Student body to improve Union's athletics .. The process of grading is already well under way and, with proper student assistance, will soon be finished. President Day's announcement of the plan was a shock to the Student body, fo1· the initiation of any plan to better the college's athletics has, herE>tofore,. been left to the students.

The drea.m of an organization that might compete on equal terms with. college dramatic socie- ties, with financial hacking sufficient to eiJable them to present perfoTmances unhampered by poor theaters, started years ago. Taken up spasmodically by the student members of the Mounte~ banks, but allowed to lapse hy the graduation of the more active members of the organization, the campaign was finally carried to its climax by the theless labo:~,· of those members of the faculty who have worked with the uiJde1:graduates solely in th€ interests of dramatics and of the college. ffitimate success~ howev~r, has not as yet been reached. The Student body must prove th~tt it deserves the better dramatic productions that the new theater will make possible.

Continued from Page One months and gave a list of the various intra-mural champions. . William W. · Roper, coach of foot- ball at Princetan university, gave th<\ main speech of the evening'. He began with a statement that it is association with young mel) that keeps one young. A gra~eful tribute to his friend, George Daley, followed. Mr. Roper then referred to the crisis in foot- ball which occurred in 1905 after a. number of serious accidents in games had aroused the antagonism of legis- latins and faculty members of t.Qe colleges. Fo(}tball was then a game for no lightweight, but only for the toughest, hardest, strongest man. The agitation. to abolish the game reached such a height that Presid~nt Roose- · velt sent for the coaches ·Of Yale, Harv-ard:, and Princeton to urge them to clean up the game aml its rules, that the game :might persist in a bet- ter f()rm. Fit:t Presented Gift Since that time the progtess of the· development of football has been con-· tinuous. 'l\oday it demands a. maiL!!! . speed and b.mins. The game is nol one of 11 individuals, but of a co- ordinating team whose elements may · be of mediocre ability; but whose. power to work together is unstinted. The membeTs of any team must be of .first class physical condition if they hope to succeed, a fact which he . proved by several instances~ Football does not demand l}.Ilusual ability, but merely the capadty to concentrate. Learn the lesons of concentration young and you win all be million- . aires, was his prophecy. Following this forceful speech, President DeLong of the Student body presented to Ed Fitz the two. twenty dollar gQld pieces contributed by the undergraduates in apprecia.tion of the continued friendship aild ser- :Viees .of the trahie!:· You will find th~ fin~st leatlu~rs and most corr~ct lin~s in John Ward shoes.

We have come to the conclusion that all tl1e bally-hoo last year about the lack of spitit was nothing but bally-hoo, despite · the fact that we joined in with others who were deploring tpe situation. It was also pleasing to hear George Daley~ popular alumnus who conceived the idea of such a banquet in honor of our athletes, admit that he had to toss the sermon he had pre- pared it1to the waste basket. .We have an idea, and we think it is well-founded,. that he intended to pitch into the student body hot and hea''Y and offer some typical alumni advice on the revival of the \Spirit of Old Union\. He said as much when he stated: \I thought spirit was lacking but I was wrong.\ It should bring us to our senses with a jolt. A banquet such as the one last night shows that there is plenty of spirit and that all it needs is an occasion for letting it loose, The band played as it has never played before. The gymnasium resounded with the first REAL cheering we have heard since Union scored its touchdown against Hamilton on Alexande1· field last year. It was a real exihibition of true collegiate spirit. .And then when we come right down to it, 'what is spirit? George Daley gave us the right idea when he said it was belief, Belie:f in Onion College gives birth to Union spirit. Wlmt could be simpler? We do not need winning teams. We de not need a lot of rah-Tah, hip, hip, hooray yelliilg• All we need is belief in the college and if there is one student who hasn't a profound faith a;nd belief in Unicm College, he doesn't belong here.

That's one reason why so much of the Herald Tribune's circulation is composed of college men and women now living in and about New York. They have found that the Herald Tribune give~ them all the news without being dusty or dnb or sensational about it; they have found,. also, that their own interests, (sports, the theatre, business and finance, society's ac- tivities, music) whatever they may be, are chronicled faithfully and well in the Herald Tribune by a band of experts who take their work .seriously and themselves lightly. That's why the Herald Tribune is winning so many new readers. That's why we'd like to have you tty it, say, next Sunday.

At the same time Coach H!trkness is in an optimistic mood about the chances o£ his team. No matter who wins it will not be a walkover fm.· either team and the game will he worth a one hundred per cent turnout of the student body. REMEMBER THE BLOCK \'U\ DINNER Which h1·ings us to another matter. It takes us back to ··' the Block \U\ dinner when George Daley and others remarked on the enthusiasm of the undergraduates. It was the result ef cooperation between the undergraduates and the faculty joined .. , together. They joined to hono1· the athletes. It would be a great sight to see this same cooperation tomorrow afternoon when the Gamet meets the Crimson. A CHANCE FOR THE KICKERS TO EXERCISE Three days have been ~e.t asi<le for the first punting and (lrop-kieking contest ever to be Htagecl for the undergraduates at Union. Henry Laurenee Achilles who occupies a two-fold position here a.~:~ director of religionH work and assistant coach of hockey organized the plan at the football meeting this winter to hold a competition this spring to di,srover the best punters · and drop-kickers in the college. He is donating what is to he called the Union College 1\:icking Trophy, a cup to be inscribed with the namcR of the winner:-; in the contest each year, and several other prizes will be o lfe.n·d. ;This plan w:u; <'oneeive<l with the idea in view that ·it would not only stimulate .an early interest in the succeeding football season, hnt also bt·iug forward any unclergraduates with exceptional punting or drop-kicking ability who may hu.Ye been hiding their light under a buslleT. As there is no spring' io.otballi practice at Union the contest is C'ertninly the first step in thaV direction. It will start the kiel<ers pradicing dm~ing the spring a.i1d the practice will subsequently develop new ones and improve those who have already exh:ibitcd their ability. Perhaps in the coming yeal's these individun.l practice w01·lmuts might develop into an organized spring JH'adice for all the football men. Although tllis may seem far fetched we must admit that the possibility remains and it is well worth thinking about. 607 Liberty St. Phone 9778 COM£ TO ALLING RUBBER CO.

Thr.ee hours weekly during the year. M:r. Wainger. '!'his is a Survey Course in American Literature, b\lt the emphasis will be givel:'l to the principal writers, such as Tlhomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Webster, Emerson, F.I<llwthorne, L0weH, Poe, Melville, Whit- mar:,. and Henry James. Throughout the Course the religious, political, and social background will be stressed. The literary development of the later periods will be traced with the aim of •throwing Hght on contemporary writers and tendencies. Lectures, cl<J;ss disc.us13ions, and colla:ter.al.l.'\eading are included. English 7; 'l'he Novel. Elective for Seniors in the AB Courses. Three hours weekly throughout th.e year. Professor Hale. Th,is is a course on the 1;1ovel in England. and America, beginning with. the nineteenth century, with a casual survey of the earlier history of fiction. ;t:.n the first semester the work is given on the basis of .a &tudy of: St<Jt>t's .. \Ivanhoe\, Jane Austen's \Pride and Prejudice\ Thackeray's \Vanity Fair\ Dickens' \Bleak House\ Hawthorne's \Scarlet Letter''., George Eliot's \Adam Bede\ Charl~tte Bronte's \Jane Eyre'•, Meredith's \Ordeal of Richard Fev:eral''.

Arnold Bennett'.s \Old Wives' Tale\ John Gals worthy's \The Country Bouse\; J ose.ph Con- rad's \ViDiory\, Mrs. W'harton's \The Age of Innocence\ Joseph Hergesheimer's \Java Head\. The work consists of lectures and dis- GUssions, much as in the first semester. English g:: Advanced Coinpo:;ition I. Elective for Juniors and Seniors in the AB courses. Three hours weekly during the year. Professor Herrick Dull writing, however clear and aq:urate, is discouraged throughout the course. During the first semester the art of interesting, as applied to expo's~tion, is studied. To achieve the most effective mans of ex- pressing individual thinking, a series of assignments are given which afford frequ.ent and varied praotice in compositon. 'Phe class work consists of a critical discussion of student essays, o.f a kind of Socratic method of asking questions, of lectures on the principles c;>f literary expression, and of analysis of literary models, studied in connection with certain problems o£ style on which the class is working. The second semester resembles the first, .except that the course deals with the poetics of rhetoric, that is to say, with the more imaginative aspects of writing, particularly narration. Individual conferences, however, are the most importa..n1 part of the work throughout the course. During these conferences special difficulties of the student are carefully consid- ered and faulty passages are polished and hammered into shape. English 10: :Modern. Drama. Elective for Jun•iors and Senio11s in the AB courses. Three hours weekly during the year. Professor Herrick This course deals with the beginn~ng& of the subject in France and traces its development irt Norway, Swed~n, England, Russia, Germany, Austria, ~angary, Italy~ Spain, Ireland, and America. It deals with modern Eur<it~eart. ~ild American dr~:rp.a;tist.s. from fi ugo and Sc. ribe in France, and Ibsen tn Norwa·y,. to 0 Neill m Amenca. It stresses not so much who· they are but what they are, showing; their significance and their C()nttibution to the Art of the ·theater. By lectures and by a kind of Socntic method of asking questions, problems of art,. technique and contemporary life are discussed a.s they arise in the study of the plays thems.elves. From 'time to time,the chronological dcv~lopment of the course is halted in order to discuss the recent ·Outsta.ndmg· con- tributions to the theater by the New York stage. Moreov~r,. students · in the coune are strongly urged t0 see the best co11temporarY plays, · because, aLthough a good play loses little or nothing by being read, it · was originally written to be acted. English I:J:: English Literature of the Eighte~nth Centary. Elective fot juniors and Senior~ in the AB courses. Three ho\1rs weekly throughout the year. Professor ·Green. This course consists largely of a discussion of selections from the prose and poetry of the time. The chief authors considered Defoe, Addison, Steele, Swift, Pope, Gray, Collins, Johol).son, Boswell, Gold- smith, Burke, and the writers of \Go Romance\. The point of view from which these writers are studied is the opposition between Aristoc- racy, Toryism, Classicism, and Sa.tire on the one hand; and Dem.ocracy, Whiggism, Romanticism, and Humanitarianism on the. other. A knowl- 'edge of English history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries will ·he found useful for this course. This course alternates with English 8 (Chaucer), which will not be given again until W30 .. I931. English u: Advanced Composltion II. Three. h<mrs weeldy throughout the year. Professor Herrick. This co1.1rse may be elected b:y ortly five men who have taken English 9 and who have done distinguished work. It is planned for men of marked ability who seriously intend to take up writing or the .teaching o.f v;riti11.g as a profession, and it aims to give greater freedom and practice in writing under direct supervision. The meeting~ of this group, whith are held in Professor Herrick's study, are most mformal and are devoted mainly te the reading and discussion of the litera.ry work of the numbers of the class. Discussions in the Socratic manner are .frequently einployed to solv.e individual problems of style, to st~<Ly vattous types of literature, to d11'ect the course of readmgj and to gtve furth~r training in the principles o£ literary expression and of literary criticism, English 14 and xs: Junipr and Senior Public Speaking.

Indoor baseball has been suggested as an excellent substitute for outdoor base- ball. We have discovered that there are three main reasons o:ffe1·ed for substituting indoor baseball for the present system. Inasmuch as we see two sides of the question, we will proceed to take. each one separately and try to give the opposite view. The first one is that the main reason why the fraternity men do not want to participate in the outdoor game is that it requires a greater skill and technique. We may not have been listening very attentively, but we have not heard \so many fra- ·· ternity men\ complain about the outdoor game. As for the. skill and technique, we had an idea that skill and technique are the aims of every athlete no matter what his sport may be and the higher we place om• goal, the greater will be the resulting improvement. Are intramural victories to be based on the slogan, \May the worst team win\? That is what this argument seems to amount to. Tl1e second one is relative to the lack of equipment among fraternity men. Perhaps there may be a lack of gloves to go around, but we may have not seen any of the teams pla,y g1oveless yet, so we imagine that there must be some way to acquire the equipment if it .is lacking. :The athletic department supplies· the bats, balls, bases, and catchers equipment. What eiS'~ is necessary? Spiked shoes are not vitaJ to the success of the game as played between fraternities. I:f, as was suggested, fea1· of inj.ury may scare some, spiked shoe·s could be prohibited in the outdoor game, thereby doing away with one of the most dangel'OU$ of injuries. And then, ... baseball is baseball, why try to make a tea party out of it? . The third main reason is the possibility that an ineligi:ble. va1·sity man can play and his fraternity team will be benefited · toe greatly. in the past we have seen men who were ineligible for the varsity sport compete in othei· interfraternity games .. Why shouldn't they? This argument -can be applied to every other intramural activity. We.,.have thought of other suggestions for next winter, such .as the substitntion of :ping-pong fo1· interfraternity basket- hall and the game of tag for touch football. ·. The suggestion for introducing indoor baseball does not fi:nd' • favor with us. We mu~t remember that another aim of intra- mutal activity is to uncover prospective va1·sity material. In- door baseball falls far short here. We would like to l::rave some· comment from othe1's on this suggestion. Any letters received which are signed by the sender will be published with or without the signLtture; t\S desired. ST. REGIS PHARMACY Cba.rles R .. Carey, Prop. GOO 'UNION ST.

The organization has achieved a success that surprised even its most hopeful backers and it has proved that it entirely deserYe!5 the suppoTt of the whole Student body. Although full undergraduate subscription to the l\Iounte- banks' financial dri'l'e has not as yet been obtained, contributions art- steadily being received and the sum needed to repay the loan which made it possible for the organization to buy its new stage will soon be reached. The other object of the drive, how- ever, to obtain one hundred per cent undergraduate subsci-i'p- tion, regardless of the amount each student contributes, is still in the distance. When that goal has been reached, the Mounte- banks will have attained complete success in theit efforts to give Union a better and worthier dramatic organization completely backed hv the Student body. H. F. K. NE'\iV E. E. LABORATORY A gift of $150,000 has been donated by Harold Russell Ryder of X cw York for the erection of a new Electrical Engi- n~ering laboratory. :Mr. Ryder has also given about $50,000 · for the maintenance of the building. The plans announced by President Day are that the laboratory w1ll be erected on the site of the College Union. '\'hat will be done with old E. E. laboratory has not been decided upon. This new laboratorv will fulfill a need which has long been . ~ felt by the Electrical Engineering department. It will be one of the best in the country and will certainly .make the oppor- tunities offered by this course superior to others in colleges of our size. Modern equipment for instruction will be only one of the manv advantarros of the new laboratory. Classrooms for . e . the electrical engineers will be included in the building whereas thci1· rooms are now scattered in the various buildir1gs.

This gift brings Mr. Ryder's contributio11s to Uniun College to about $225,000, for he established a loan fund of $25~000 for needy students last winter.

It means that the . faculty committee has pai·d attention to the criticisms and objec- ti&ns w11ich ha-ve \been levelled at the present system. It means tl1a:t the faculty committee is trying to benefit the colilege in the best wa.y possible. COOPERATION, THE KEY-WORD This actiou of the faculty to remove the objections follows upon the recent growt'h of cooperatio'n between the under- graduates and the faculty. It proves that kicking up a fuss about something, pulling at the. other end of the rope in the opposite directio11, will not be of any use to any one, and furthermore wiU ah·ays be a detriment to the accomplishment of anything no :rrtatter what it be. It proves further that when a djfficulty is approached with a level head by both sides a. worthwhile resu.lt will •be forthcoming. We feel that the new administration under President Day has entered into the inter- ests of Union C()ll~ge with zest and enthusiasm to improve the· college. Every week, it seems, there is another forward step made by the faculty or by the administration. The next move is for the undngt-aduates to .get behind 'the college and push with everything- th.ey have. The long dreamed of cooperation is gradua.lly ass11m.ing shape and from now on the students owe it to themselves a.1ld to the college to support every project and every .suggestio11 \vhich .aims at betterment of the college. LET'S KEEP 11RE CAMPUS CLEAN President Day has asked us if we wouldn't stir up interest in a general cleaning-up process to cover the entire campus. Although this is :not a purely sports proposition, it comes under the heading of sportsmanship and therefore is not out of place in this column. As soon as the snow and slush melts away (if it ever does) tl1e 1.1eed for keeping the campus neat and attractive will be more apparent than it is now. There has been a tendency for townspeople, principally the childreH on their way to and from school an~oss our campus, to scatter papers ancl rubbish nll over. Some of them come through kicking tin cans with the result that th€y tire of kicking the can somewhere· on the campus, leaving us with a present of said 'can. This can be remedied very ea.sily by each student taking it upo11 himself to :put a stop to it. Then we come to the age old commotion of keeping off the grass. A1thougl1 tl1is subject always arises during- the spring, in th.e past •ve luve noticed that the grass has suffered just as much. 'Nith the ground soft after the prolonged winter, there will ·be an additional necessity for avoiding unnecessary tres- :passing on the lawns of the campus this spring.. T~1e inaugu- l~ation in lVIay ,.,ill bring educational notables from a.ll over the country and if the campus is not in good condition at that time, Union wllllose a. considerable bit of valuable comment. We feel this is a. spo:rting proposition for the simple reason , that it has eman.ated from one of the best sports on th!~ campus, 1 President Day.

Steep, tortuous grades increase the difficulty of the railroading problem. Nature has stub- bornly resisted man's effort to conquer the range. In January, 1929, the new Cascade tunnel was opened. Man, with elec- tricity as an ally, had con- quered the Cascades. The eight-mile bore was driven in three years- a record impossible without electric power. And electrification has beert extended to the entire 75-mile rou..te through the mountains.

Inasmuch as there is supposed to be a . • system, we are wondering why the matter of ineligibility is not carried out systematically. As we understand it tho·se men who' have not attained a second grade average shall be ineligible to· compete in more than one activity at a time. Seve1•al men have. been made ineligible fo1· this reason.. At the same time the, so-called system has operated ill: only these several cases while • others who are in the same circumstances have been overlooked. · · If there is to be a system with a committee in chaTge, let the1·e by all means be a system! ~ But, if this committee shall have . power to discriminate, there is no system. 'Why pretend there is if there isn't? It is our fi'rm belief that there should be a system without . ' any loopholes in it. If a man is declared ineligible the corn-, mittee should have .before it the rule which states that he is. On the @ther hand the committee should not have the power to pass judgment on any grounds other than those stated in the rules. If the ineligibility rules were carried out to the letter according to a system, t'he1·e would be no cause for any comment. such as this. THE FARMERS COME FORWARD Horseshoe pitcbing has stirred up such intei'est on the' campus in the past week that we expect to find some keen compe- tition for the intramural cup when the finals aTe l'eached. In fact the sport has re·ached unbelievable proporti(mS and Unipn men seem to have acquired a mania for pitching the good-luck shoes. Inasmuch as the sport is a new one here the f:t.·a.tet·nitics have found it necessary to l1old matches among the members to discover the best man to represent them on the field in the coming games. It is sutprising to find so many men who show that they have had p•revious experience at the ancient rural att. One of the fraternities has organized a house c~mpetition which .requires the members to shake themselves loose from the cool and comfortable s11eets at the unearthly hour of 6 o'clock (in the morrting) t«;J take part in a number of contests in the yard or on the front lawn. Anyone who does not arise in time for his particular inatch fodeits the victo1·y. This in itself is remarkable for it requires an enticing occupation to arouse the typical college man at such an early hour.

SUPPORT The Mountebanks drive for the repayment of th~ five thousand dollar loan which enabled the organization to purchase its new theater ends tomorrow. The campaign appeal'S to have been successful, except in one respect. The amount conb·ibuted by members of the faculty and by alumni and others inM:tested in the organization has exceeded the expectations of the officers of the Mountebanks, but the Student body has failed to give its full support. One of the purposes of the d1·ive was to cofivin~e the Board of Trustees and other doubters that full underg~aduate support for the project could be secured; that the Student body would give its backing to a worthy plan.

We have watched Kern p.itch U~ion to vict.ory f0r more than a year now but never ~id I he turn m such a performance as that on the Rensselaer d1a- . mond Saturday afternoon. It was a. n~arvelous exhibition of. speed and control and the Trojans were lucky to have even hit the ball. We were sorry to see that the Rensselaer scorers credited the home team with one hit in the accounts of the game which issued from Troy. We watched the play closely which the Troy scorer called a hit and ·it was the farthest thing from a hit that they made all afternoon. The ball was hit to Terry and it would have been a put out at first base by ten feet, if he had not thrown wild to Mitchell, who was pulled off the bag to reach it. It was clearly an error and nothing n~ore. Comment from disintet'ested spectatol's confirmed ouT belief, so we have a right to say it was not prejudice on our part which caused us to give Terry an error and Kern a no-hit game.

With everything against him-the rna terial, ineligi- bility, the weather and its consequences, he has 'tUl'ned out a team that gave one of the prettiest exhibitions of ball playing that we have seen in these parts in three years. Rensselaer was helpless and it was a good sight especially after the .defeats we suffered· · in football and in basketball, at the hands of our traditional. rival. Union vs. Rutgers Friday- The baseball team goes to Rutgers Friday to stage what we expect will be a sweet pitcher's battle. !{ern will be on the mound again for Union and he seems to be in the best possible shape he could be in at such an early date. Rutgers has two pitchers who have earned teputations for themselves in four games this season and no matter which one of them opposes the Garnet batsmen there will be some fine twirling to watch.

Kellogg Peace Pact The covenant of the Kellogg Peace Pact and the League of Nations both allow a defensive war to be a legal wa;r. The trouble with this, is an adequate and satisfactary definition of war to be iegal, is not easily obtained, and there are none at pres- ent that can be agreed upon by the nationli themselves. Freedom of the seas is the anti- theSis of sea power w·hic!h is consid- -ered as dominance of the sea in time of war. Many nati{)ns hav<J contested· the contra! of the seas but certaiu things could not be carried on in time of war because they would violate the rights of neutrals. For inshnce, during the Great War nearly every rule of neutrality was violated by every nation and it did a great deal in bringing the United States into the war. The thing bbat defeated Germany was the control that . the United States and Great Britain had· over the seas that finally suffocated Germany. There will never be a satisfadory disarmament conference unless the United States, Japan, and Great Britain can define their objective in freedom of the seas.
