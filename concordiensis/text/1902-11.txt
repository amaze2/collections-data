Saturday, Nov. 8, by a score of 56 to o. Daly played thoughout the game, this being his first appearance in a match game this season. He is preparing hin1self for the approaching game with Annapolis. After the first half several n1en of regular teams were replaced by substitutes. The fea- ture of the game was a 4o-yard run by Shan_ non in which he n1ade a touchdown. Daly kicked two goals from the field. Sherrill, Cook, and von Dannenburg played the star game for Union. The line-up: '\tVest Point. Union. Copp .......................................

On Saturday, Novetnber first, Union lost to Lehigh by a score of 41-o. 1.,he defeat was by no 1neans due to Union's inferior playing, for she played a decidedly snappy game, but rather to Lehigh's weight and superiority. All through the game Lehigh made constant gains of five, ten, twenty yards, and even longer runs around the ends. Without exception the individual playing of the home tea·m is deserving of praise. Gulnac played his usual game-you know what that is-and Sherrill certainly did good work at quarter. Griswold and Cleghorn did snappy work and Cook was always on hand. ~ The game was a clean one straight through and there was no uncalled for '' scrapping.\ The game was by far the best attended of the season. Lehigh had a goodly num her of friends on the field and Union was well re- presented. 'fhe student body is to be .con- gratulated on the \vay in which it is supporting the team. C.AMPUS NOTES. The many friends of Psi Upsilon were de- lightfully entertained at the chapter house Monday evening, Noven1ber the third, when the tnetnbers -of the Fraternity opened its doors for the first formal house dance of the season. The weather all day had been cloudy but towards night it cleared and the evening turned out to be an ideal one for dancing,

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. About nine o'clock the :guests began to arrive and fro·m the time that the strains of Gioscia's familiar waltz were first heard untH the early hot,lrs of election day the friends and members of the Fraternity danced and enjoyed them- selves. About midnight light re~reshments _ were served. The house was very prettily decorated with evergreen and oak leaves. The large doors between the rooms were thrown open and the whole first floor with its seasonable decorations was transformed into an ideal dance hall. Among those present ·were: Mrs. ~rice, Mrs Strain, patronesses, the Misses Suther- land, VanZandt, Charlotte White, Harriette White, M. White, Schuyler, Palmer and vVads- worth of Albany; Hulsapple, Wood, Piccaver of Troy; Medbery of Ballston; Strain, Kriegsman, Linn, Fuller, ·Clark, N .. and G.

Last Wednesday .evening George Hackett, ex'o1, before entering the bonds of matrimony, gave a farewell ''bachelor'' dinner to his friends in the Delta Phi House. Thursday afternoon, at the ho1ne of the bride's . parents, No. 35 Barrett street, Miss ·Carrie Harbison and Mr ·George Hackett were quietly married. Only the near relatives w·ere present. Shortly after the ceremony the happy couple left for a wedding trip in the south. They will be at home in Utica December rst. Mr Hackett is a member of the Delta Phi fraternity. Announcement has just been made that the Delta Phi fraternity, which was founded at Union College in r827, will hold its seventy- fifth reunion here on November I 7. A ban- quet will be held at the Hotel Ten Eyck,. Al- bany, in the evening. 1''he gathering will doubtless be a notable one, as many prominent men are nurn be red among its alun1ni. The first undergraduate smoker of the year was held in the \gym\ Halloween night. Goodfellowship and college spirit were fostered over the cards; there were about a hundred and fifty present to enjoy the good time. There was plenty to eat and several jugs of cider. About ten o'clock the crowd marched to the depot to welcome the expected Lehigh team. Coach Whitney vvas to have been the guest of honor, but was unavoidably detained elsewhere. It is to be hoped that the efficient committee will have another smoker soon The personnel of the co1nmittee is as follows: Chairman-P-eck, 'o3 ; Bishop, 'o3 ; Hoxie, 'o3 ; G. Donnan, 'o3 ; Andrees, 'o4 ; Wickham, 'o4 ; M. King, '04 ; The members of the Chi Psi :Fraternity pleasantly entertained alumni brothers and friends from out of town at their chapter house November first. During the We~k of Prayer, commencing Nov. 9th, special services are being held in Silliman Hall each day at 7 :oo p. m. Sunday, Vesper Service at 5 :oo p. m.

D., for years an im· portan t figure in the Wyoming conference and at one time principal at Wyoming seminary, passed away in the evening of his years, in Scranton, Pa., Oct. 19, 1902, at the home of his son-in-law, City Solicitor R. D. Stuart. The deceased was an octogenarian, having entered into his eighty-third year. Death was due to heart failure accompanying his advanced years. Rev. Dr. Youngs Calkins Smith was a native of York State. He was born in South New Berlin, February I 4, 18 20. After his early

THE coN-CdRbrfENSis. school training., he entered Union :College, ' from which he was graduated in I 848. He be- came an instructor at Wyoming seminary, and being elected principal be~d that pos!ition until 1859, the year in which he,en tered the .ministry of the Methodist church, and the same year in. .which he was wedded. His marriage took place in Newark, N. ]. His bride was Miss Mary E. Wood. Dr. Smith's achievements woh him recogni- tion from Dickins<>n college, which conferred on him, in 1868, the title of doctor of divinity. His missionary work \vas quite extensive. His tninistry labors covered a -wide field having filled charges at various times at Wilkes-Barre, Pitts- ton, Carbondale, Oneontaand Owego, N. Y. Richard Burton Row.e died in Los Angeles, California, on May 26, aged 30 years. His death was due to tuberculosis, against 'vhich he had bravely struggl.ed for nearly two years. Dr. Rowe was born :in Clarksville, Albany Co., N. Y., May 3, 187:2. He entered Union College in 1892, graduating with the degree of Ph. B. in 1896 and received special honors in geology. The following year he remained at Union as an assistant in geology. In the aut- umn, as a graduate student in geology, he entered Johns Hopkins University where he remained for three years, receiving his Ph. D. degree in I 900. Dr. Rowe's work on the Paleozoic forma- tions of western Maryland was a valuable one; one of America's foremost Paleozoic paleonto- logists states that his descriptions of fossils in this report sho\v a high order of ability. While on a geological camping expedition during the past autumn and winter he over ... exerted himseH from the effects of which he never recovered. Dr. Rowe was a modest man of agreeable manners and an enjoyable companion. The writer has spent many days with him in the field, finding him an earnest worker, an accur- ate observer, and an efficient assistant. It is specially sad that his life has been brought to such an early close when he was, apparently, just entering upon a most successful career. CHARJ .. ES s .. PROSSER. ( Fron:1 the American Geologist Vol. XXX, Aug., 1902.) ALBANY LAW SCHOOL.· Work was resumed on Wednesday after the short election recess. Mr. Griswold began his course of lectures on \Books and their Uses\ to the Juniors, on Friday. There are four lectures in the course. President Drummond, of the Senior Class, was elected City Judge of Auburn, N.Y., on 1.,uesday, by a majority of 25. 1.,he senior class passed resolutions congratulating Mr. Drummond on his success, and telegraphed them to him on Wednesday. It is earnestly hoped, however, that this elevation to the bench will not prevent ''the Honorable Dick'' finishing his course at the school. The Juniors are organtztng a Moot Court Club along the lines of the two conducted by the Class of r 903 last year. William J. Grattan, 1899, and 'Villiam V. ·t Cooke, 19oo, were elected to the Assembly from the third and fourth districts of Albany County, on Tuesday last. FIRST JUNIOR HOP. The class of 1904 gave the fir~t hop of the year at Yates' Boathouse, Friday evening, November the seventh. Owing partly to the fact that the football men could not attend and partly to other existing conditions the affair was but slightly attended. Those 'vho were present, however, will not be sparing of their praise of the committee and of \J o '' whose music was '' better than ever.'' Those who graced the affair were: Mrs Price; Misses Taylor, Auburn; Wood, vVatervliet; Becker, Seneca Falls; Pier'son, Hudson; Fitcham, Ballston. From Schenectady were the Misses

BOOK REVIEWS. By a mistake in our last issue the publishers of 'c: The :1\'lississippi Bubble'' were given as the Brown-Merrill Co. The publishers of this book are the Bowen-Merdll 'Co., Indianapolis. [\A Girl Who vVrote.\ By .Alan Dale. Quail & Warner, New York.] Alan Dale, the popular dramatic critic of . . New York, has giyen us an interesting story of newspaper life in his new book, ''A Gir 1 \'Vho \Vrote.\ 'I' he leading characters are '' cogs '' in the great machine of journalism. In the princi- pal character, ~liss Sallie Sydenham, or the \Girl Who vVrote,\ he has given us a type that is new. Although thinking and working among the prosaic \owls\ of Newspape1· Row, and in a somewhat tainted atn1osphere, she still retains the stamp of true woman- hood. rfhe book was not written for prudes, for with Dale a \ spade is a spade.\ Yet vvith all his freedom of speech the book is far frorn obscene; and although the humor. is somewhat coarse, it is perfectly natural when we consid- er the surroundings of the characters. 'The boyish chivalry of little Robinson, the loyal friendship . of Charlie Covington, and the unselfish, tender laughing Sallie, are all wo1·thy of the keenest admiration. \V. E. B., 04. [\The Future of War.\' :By Jean de Bloch, translated by R. C. Long, Ginn & Co., Boston. soc.l 'I'his volume is a translation of the sixth \ \ ' and last volume of Jean de Bloch's monumen- tal work on the \Future of War,'' and con- tains a sun1n1ary of all the important principles of the other volumes. Jean de Bloch was a Polish Jew who, by his own indefatigable efforts, raised hilnseTf to the position of one of the first economists and financiers in Rus.. sia. He viewed the in1portant question of militarism in its technical, economic and poli- tical aspects and his book is the result of a decade of careful study and investigation along these lines. The effect of its publica- tion upon the intellectual forces surrounding the Czar and upon the Czar himself, probably led to the calling of the I-Iague Conference. In his preface the author points out the itnpossibility of great wars in the future, be- cause of economic and social condi6ons and the technical aspects of modern warfare. He also points out that the present armed peace of Europe with its enorn1ous cost is in d~nger of leading to social disorders of far more seri .. ousness than the ''great war \ dreaded by many. 'I'he book proper is a substantiation of his belief and contains chapters on the cost and methods of future \Var and on the econo- n1ic difficulties in time of war. T'he whole question is treated fron1 a common-sense, husi.: ness standpoint, supplementing the n1oral and humane arguments usually advanced. [\The :Man in the Street.\ Stories Frem the New York Times, with an Introduction by Chancey M. Depew. J. S. Ogilvie Publishing Co., New York. $I.oo.] A collection of witty and pitby anecdote~ which are just the thing for after dinner speeches and banquet stories. There is not a dull line in the book.

Addres~ all communications to THE CONCORDIENSIS, Union Col'lege, Schenectady, N. Y; Silliman Hall. It has been brought to the attention of the editors that the students are not e:xercis- ing a proper amount of care in the lise ef Silliman Hall. This building is intended as a general rallying and meeting place for the college men, and as such should be respected. 'fbe indiscriminate littering of the floor and tables with waste paper, dirt; broken shoe laces and football paraphenalia, as was done on the oc- casion of a recent football game when one team used this building as a dressing room, is an abuse of the priVileges of Silliman Hall. In the future let every student consider himself a member of a committee which has in its charge the proper use and maintenance of our new college build- ing, and when any organization holds meetings ;here in the futur~ let it be responsible to the student body for the orderly condition of the rootns on its adjournment, Fraterni ~y lU.gbt. A movement is on foot among the ten fraternities of college to ,enter into an agreement whereby a certain night in each weel shall be set apart by all of them to be ex· dusively for their own uses. This plan is f,n successful <>,peration in Columbia, Amherst and other prominent colleges a11d deserves the careful consideration of all fraternity men. Under existing conditions there is scarcely an evening in the week that can be appointed i'or instrutnental and glee dub rehearsals, f0otball prac- tice, or oth.er meetings of college organizations when men <>f ev.ery :fraternity can be present. The adoption of a ll·nHorm time for the uses of the fraternities will obviate such difficnlties and in every way aid and strengthen un- <lergraduate life. FAMA PATERNA. A noble name is hard to bear. For with it comes a trust and care. And also brings an honor deep Which one alone must strive to keep. '' To tell the truth\ it sets a pace, But finds one weak to run the race So \on the whole\ one casts his lot And tries to be what he is not. Q. E.

.. .J ·THE CONOORDIENSIS. 11 ' ' GIFTS TO ED'UCA TlON. . buildings; .so that even now'· a Ron1anesqu~ '· Oxford is to be found at Palo Alto. To reflect on the fact that more donations of m-oney have. been devoted to the cause of education during the year past, than in any year p:revious, leads interested persons to wonder and inquire as to the respective mo- tives and the respective purposes of the most significant gifts; and perhaps a brief compari- son with earlier gifts. Harvard College, during the first eighteen years of its existence, had not over $7 ,ooo.oo in available funds. Abbott Lawrence's gift of $so, ooo to Harvard in 1847, to found there a school of scienee, was said at the titne, to be the largest gift of any one man, at any one time during his lifetin1e for educational pur- poses. Five years later Joshua Bates gave to the city of Boston $so, ooo.oo for the public library, and the praise for his liberality was almost equal to that offered Mr. Carnegie for his $so,ooo.oo library buildings. All this shows how comparatively new is the practice of donating large sums to insti- tutions of learning. The gifts during the past year include thousands of compara- tively stnallones, which are just as treasured as the large ones, though not so universally heralded. In consider·ing the significance of the vari- ous gifts, we find that there is a peculiar signi- ficance attending each of the four largest donations in the year past. I refer to the gifts ~f Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford, of Mr. Andrew Carnegie, of 1\fr. John D. Rocke- feller, and of Cecil Rhodes. The gift of the Stanfords to the Californian University which bears their name, amounted in all to about thirty million dollars. ·l'he gift is unique in that it is the largest ever made for this cause, and it is significant in that it was the result of a nobte man's love for the West, and his desire to give it such advantages in educational lines as should fit it to becon1e one of the most cultivated business centres of the world. The annual incon'le fro1n this be- quest has produced a no·ble body of academic The motive predominant in all Mr. Carne- gie's giving has beep. to aid the cause of · higher scholarship. In this, his enor·mous gifts for research and public libraries are pe- culiarly significant. The Ainerican college has· for its supreme purpose the making of the man and the equipment of .the gentleman; while scholarship has been more or less a secondary aim. This of course is less true of the technical schools, but the scho:lars of the world are not Americans, and will not b~ for decades. But the wisdom of Mr. Carnegie's method of endowtnent as his high purpose of the foundation, warrant the warmest commen- dation. The most interesting significance of · his endowment to research and libraries is that it paves the way for the uniting of the past, present and future of science. The· book is a record of what humanity has accom- plished. The scientific laboratory represents the truths that are to be discovered, the facts not yet made into theory, or theories not }yet applied to science. The library represents the past transmuted into the present, the s~hool of research represents the future transmuted into the present. In the gifts of Mr. Rockefeller, one finds three characteristics. First, the gifts are pro- portioned to the needs of the cause to l:Je benefited; second, the gifts are usually condi- tioned upon raising certaia amounts from other sources; and third, the gifts follow a careful investigation of the 'vorthiness of the cause. Mr. Rockefeller's gift to the Harvard Medical School is perhaps the most significant of his recent gifts. For his contribution with Mr. Morgart's should make it in a few years, the 1eading school for the study .of medicine in the world. Upon considering the life and work at ·Oxford, the bequest of Cecil Rhod~s is seen to have for its aim the ennobling of humanity, and the promoting of the moral and social enrichn1ent of humanity, especially that part of it which is English. ·

: \' I I I i. l 'fHE OONQO~PIENSI$. Each of these four examples to!lched upon, has an intimate relation with the others~ to- gether they form a complete. whole. 'The gift of money, large or small. to the cause of education is among the noblest forms of securing training for the heart, the hand,. or the mind of man. E T K: . . . . FRATERNITY INITIATES.

NOONDAY iN CAMP. The summer sun, directly overhead, Beats down upon the earth in simmering rays ; I lie within the hammock, 'neath the pines \Vithin whose shade a sunbeam seldom strays. A noon-day quiet settles o'er the lake, And o'er the wooded highlands round about Broken by scarce a murmur, or a sound, Save cry of whippoorwill, or splash of trout. Out on the glassy surface of the lake Beneath \the shadows of the southern shore Sits Bill, within our rude flat~bottomed boat ' Just as he's been this hour past,-and more ; Once and again he slowly draws his hook Up to the surface to renew the bait ; His calm, deliberate motions go to show His lazy, blissful, all-contented state. \Vithin the tent, stretched out upon the bed, '' The Deacon'' soundly sleeps, and snores the while ; Then gapes and stretches, wakes, and sleeps again, Upon his face a sleepy, dreamy smile. Up in the woods you hear the axe-stroke loud, Of Jim, whose foraging for fire-wood; He seems to stop and think between each stroke, How very soon he'd stop it,-if he could. Off to the left is Chuck·, beneath the tent Where hangs the grimy pot above the fire ; A savory odor's wafted from the spot,- The simple fare of which we never tire. The cook takes from a nearby handy branch, A long tin horn, and blows a mighty blast,- Then what a transformation comes o'er all ! The time for drowsy idleness is past ! The fisherman pulls in his slender line, And grabs his oars, and quickly rows ashore. The sleeper in the tent jumps up straightway, His dreams have vanished,-Sleep can rule no more ; The axeman drops his tools, and fairly runs Down through the woods, straight for our sylvan board; The cook prepares to fill the ample plates ; The camp wakes up at last with one accord,- For it is DINNER-TIME!

D., a graduate of the Albany 1vledical College in the class of '83, who has been a sufferer frotn consun1ption for more than a year, was buried from his late residence on Eagle street in Albany on Friday morning, October 3r. Dr. Van Allen was born at Delmar, January 16, r86r. His father was Dr. John Van Allen, grandson of Colonel Frederick Frelinghuysen, of the New Jersey Minute I\1:en, of '76. The deceased, after graduation from the Albany Medical College, continued his medical studies in several institutions in Europe. Shortly after his return, he was appointed an instructor and subsequently a lecturer in the Albany Medical. He became ophthaln1ic and aural surgeon at St. Peter's Hospital and was one of the incorporators of the South End Dispen- sary, which has done so much good in that section of Albany. . Not only among the tnetnbers of his own profession, but to all his friends and acquain- tances, he was a popular, courteous and genial .. , gentleman. He was fonnerly president of the Albany County Medical Society, and was also connected with the Masons and Press Club. MODERN FEETBALL. How to Play It. Ftom the Chicago Tribune. LESSON I. The essential qualification for players of feet- ball are strength, cunning and a hotnicidal mania. The coach should first select his can- didates, after carefully considering a list of their past performances. He should then turn then1loose in. a large lot and permit the law of the survival of the toughest to weed out the un- desirable players. Practice should begin with light cases of may- hem and gradually become more severe, the . players being carefully instructed in assault·and

In the next lesson I will take up the subJect of proving alibis when accused of killing one of the rival team and deal in detail with each position. W. BuRLEY GuY. P. S.-Use callousine.

Werner, Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals, gave an inforn1al talk to the student body in the chapel. Judge Tennant in a few well chosen words introduced the speaker to the students, more than seventy-five of both classes being present. In the course of his remarks Judge vVerner said that there were lawyers and lawyers, but there is always room at the top for the bright, energetic young lawyer. He laid special stress upon the fact that the student must not forget that he has a body as well as a n1ind to develope, \for a lawyer who studies with his liver is always a poor·counsel.

THE CONCORl)IENSIS. PERSONALS. Edward Everett Hale, Jr., professor of rhet- oric in Union College, is editor of an attract- ive series of English and American classics is- sued by the Globe School Book ·Company. There have already appeared '·'English Essays,'' i \American Essays,\ \Greek Myths\ and \Bal- lad Poetry.\ The extracts which fill each little volume are short and by eminent authors. The introductions depart from the usual ac- count of the life and works of the writer, but deal with the place in literature held by the selections. The· editor's little essay on ''Ballad Poetry\ is remarkable in its interesting treatment of a technical subject for young people These books show the spirit of our time in departing from the old memorization of facts about men and books and in pointing the way to an appre- ciation of literature as art. Herbert B. Reece, 'os, who has been with the Hudson River Day Line for the past four months, has returned to college. Willis Nelson Simons, of Canajoharie, \Vil- liam Abner ·Woodruff, of Troy, and Albert Stephen Dederick, of Cohoes, all of the class of 1906, have been recently initiated into Phi Sig·ma Kappa. Robert B. Costree, M. D., and Clayton 1{. Haskell, 2nd,· M. D. were present at the initiation ceremony. Since the last list of matriculants at the Medical College appeared in the Concordien- sis, the following have been enrolled: Herbert Thomas Crough, of Canajoharie, and Russell Clute, of Amsterdam, 'o3; Edward Augustus Stapleton, 'o4, of Hoosick Falls; Zenas Van Dusen Orton, 'o6, of Northampton; John Sears McCormack, 'o6, of Albany. 1,his ad- dition brings the number of those in attend- ance at the '' Medic'' up to 164, which is the highest mark ever reached.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS VoL. XXVI. UNION ,C:OLLEGE, NOVEMBER 19, 1902. No.8. ~ : ·~ ~. . ~ ·•. virRMONT 29; UNION o. The University of Vermont defeated Union ·at Burlington, Nov. 15, by a score of z 9-o. rl'his was the last game of the season for the green-mountain boys, and they finished with a fine record. \Vith probably the best team they have had in years they had tied ]rown and \Villiatns and had beaten vVesleyan. Con- sequently Union expected a hard gan1e. 1'he gatne ·was a hard and close one though the score does· not irldicate the closeness of the , struggle~ Apart fro-m the fact .that tin1e was frequently taken out for prolonged discussions the game was unusually interesting to watch. , The first half was characterized by frequent . . fu~bles which caused the ball to change hands in quick succession. At first the play . . . was about even and in the centre of the field Vermont was forced to kick. The ball went <;>ut_ of bounds, whereupon Union using the out of bounds. play devised by Coach Whitney carried the ball in two runs for a distance of ~o yards. After a long discussion Vern1ont \vas given the ball in the centre of the :field for holding. Vermont futn bled, then Union fumbled and when Vennont secured the ball t~ey ran for 40 yards around right end for a touch down on the next play and kicked the goal. 1\'he play was very close throughout the rest of the half but Vermont succeeded in tnaking another touchdown just as ti1ne was up frotn which a goal was kicked. On the kick-off in the second half Union got the ball on a fumble on Vermont's z o yard line. Vermont held well and got the ball. After an exchange of punts Vermont pushed the ball over for a third touchdown. rrhen Union braced up and held their opponents for a while. But then by a long run caused by good interference Vermont brought the ball within 8 yards of the goal line. Union could not prevent them scoring then and the 'sco-re was 2 3-o. The ball was punted frequen;tly after this and on one of the punts Vernont ran through a broken field for their last touch- down. The game showe~ much improvement in our teatn especially on the defense. Vermont was forced to kick time and again and only earned 2 of these touchdowns by steady line bucking. The two long gains Vermont· n1ade around Union's right. rrhe only play . tl1at worked for us to any advantage at all was the out-of-bounds play. On this we gained every time and a good many yards at that. On the whole Union was weaker on the offerise than the defense being several times in good scoring distance and unable to gctin. Dann put up an excellent game at right guard and Cleghorn was used to advantage on· tackle back. Gulnac and Griswold played wen and Anderson seldom dropped a punt. The whole tean1 put up a hard fight to the finish 'v hile the lack of a scrub team brought Vertnont's score up. DR. VANDER VEER'S RECEPTION. . The students of the Medical College· were tendered a reception 'Thursday evening, 'No- vember sixth, at the home of Dr. Vander- Veer, corner of State and Eagle streets. Through the courtesy of the Dean, the iirvita- tions were extended through the college \branch of the Y. M. C. l\.. Besides the students, nearly all the prominent clergymen and physi- cians of the city were invited, in additio11 to the men1bers of the faculties of Union College, Albany Medical College, and the Albany Law School.

The affair was entirely informal and every- body was at his ease. \Vilson, 'o5, and Harris, 'o6, presided at the piano and led in a round of college songs. The musical program was varie.d by some clever work by Messrs. Robin- son and Harry McClure with the bells and piano. Mr. McClure also rendered a couple of his inimitable monologues. All enjoyed a delicious supper served by NcElveney, after which the smokers retired to tbe offices down- stairs and· listened to the Ho\v of wit from various members of the faculty and the young- er alumni. About one hundred and fifty persons were present and each one voted the reception a great success. ALBANY. LAW SCI·i'OOL. With comn1endable enterprise and zeal the Junior Class, has arranged a schedule of Moot Court cases for the winter.. Judges have been selected and attorneys have been ap- pointed to argue appeals containing difficult points· and questions of la-w. Knotty and gnarled \Posers are involved in these cases, which are sufficiently difficult to test the ability of the bench and bar in actual, practice. November 21st at z :3o p. ·m., is the tin1e when ·the gowned and stately judges will listen to the arguments from the le~rned and Grafty counsel. The foP<?wing are the. cas~s . . - .. •. ~ -' -\\ for the first term of Court, and the names of those who Will argue them, and pass upon their n1erits. I. Brown vs. Smith. (Infants' Liability). VanAllen and Bahlar, for appellants ; Bin- nan and Easton for respondents. 2. Lane vs. Johnston. (Liability on prom- issory note). Hatt and McKelvey for appel- lants ; Shay and Chaffee for respondents. 'fhe Judges are Brown, Drummond~, ·O'Reilly and McFarren. The following graduates of the school were sworn in as attorneys and counsellors at the Appell:ate Division of the Supreme Court, on November 11th, 1902. John F. Brady, of Albany; James H. Colborne, of New Balti- tnore ; Benjamin D. Haight, of New J3erlin ; Douglas W. Paige, of Schenectady ; George C. Sheldon, ex 'o2, of \froy was also admitted to practice. The Senior Class held a meeting on Friday, 14th. On motion of Lawless, an1ended by Minkin, it was resolved that the executive con1n1ittee wait upon the Faculty, in regard to making some change in the present ar- rangement of the schedule, which is rather unsatisfactory on account of its uncertainty. On motion of Mills it was further resolved that the executive cornmittee investigate the possibility of holding a Class Smoker, prior to the Christmas recess. Benjatnin B. Hutchins, Esq., 'o:z, visited the school recently. John J. Mcinerney, 'o4, has been appointed to the reportorial staff of the Coneordiensis. Judge Tennant, being engaged in Court for the week beginning the 17th, his lectures are temporarily suspended. However, he left a knotty question in the hands of the Senior Class-The Suspension of the Power of Aliena- tion-· which he expects will be mastered upon his return.

T·HE (JONCORD!ENSIS. MUSICAL ASSOClA TlON. As our college days have passed quietly by 'Y.e have listened very attentively to the urgent pl:.eas of our football representatives, we have responded very generously (yet there are some of course who never realize the importance of this matter}, we have watched with an eager eye the \doings on the campus.\ Just as this out of door excitement is about to close we are reminded that the musical association has not been idle. During the fall evenings while many of us have been looking after various interests the n1embers of the instrumental and glee clubs have been faithfully developing their musical ability. The time has now come when we shall hear results of this laborious training. Tomorrow evening the association will go to Scotia where it will give its first concert of the season. The result will necessarily be either failure or success but judging from the past we shall expect nothing but success. A large number of fellows ought to show their spirit and encourage the clubs by going over with then1. The program has been very carefully arrang- ed and it gives us great pleasure to print it in this issue. PROGRAM. I. Winter Song GLEE CLUB, 2.

'f.he meetings were held at seven and. were very short but most profitable and were very well attended. The speaker was usually a member of the faculty and spoke not over ten 1ninutes. The great truth and vir- tues were brong-ht out pla,inly and forcibly and shown in a new light which would appeal to students. The program for the week was as follows : . Sunday, Vesper Service. \Put on the whole armor of God.\ Rev. F. \tV. Adams. . Monday, ''Having truth for a girdle,\ Prof. Edwards. Tuesday, '' Fut on the breastplate of right- eousness,\ Fres.

The .Omicro:tJ Chapter of the Nu Sigma Nu fraternity, of the Albany Medical College, gave a very enjoyable reception and dance to its friends last Fr~iday evening in Ellis Hall. The night was pleasant ·and the floor of the hall was in prime condition. The \ Medics \ are to be congratulated on the success of this, their first social function of the year. ·There w,ere several out of town guests, but the greater number of those present were from the city.. Mrs. Edward Chadwick,. Mrs. Milton H. St().kes and Mrs. Charles D. Ottman chaperoned the party. Among the young ladies present were Mrs. Sherman and Miss Orr, of Schenectady; Miss l(ing of Glovers- ville, and Miss Loop, of Cohoes.

Reed·, of Schenectady; Harry Haight, Union, 'o6; and the following medical students: Fosbury, 'o'4; Loop, 'o4; Singleton, 'o4; Papen, 'os, and Schaible, 'o 5· The active members of the chapter were Davis, Douglas, lVIurphy, Cotter, White, and \Vilson, 'o4; Blackfan, IIays, and Rulison, of 'os; Collie, Ehle, and J(rieger, of 'o6. CHAPEL MEETING. President Bolles calls the n1eeting to order. Parker announces that the Athletic Board has ·recognized the formation of a Basket Ball Association. A special tax may not· have to be levied if all the regular tax money is paid in, as there is nearly enough money due to run the Basket Ball team. Hunt tnoves that the tneeting proceed to the election of a manager. President Bolles requests the secretary to read nam.es of can- didates who have registered with him. Stae- ber is the only candidate registered. Donnan moves that the secretary cast one vote for Staeber. Carried. Staeber is elected. Cap't Gulnac speaks of the necessity of having a large scrub this week. Union must win the New York game and with a good scrub this can be done. Howe announces that there will be no- tneet- ing of the Concordiensis board this week but that there ·will be an important meeting next Monday. Howe also announces musical rehearsals and calls attention to the obligations of the mem- bers of the Glee club to be present at ''Col- umbia.\ Donnan bespeaks a strong cheering squad on the sidelines during this week's' practice. ·

All applicants must appear in person at the college office between the hours of 10 and 12 a.m. on November 22nd, What! are we actually to have that much needed perseDage, a college policeman ? No ! this is but a vision which. came to tl1e editor in the still wa~ches of the night. A.nd then we :awoke ! But laying all levity aside, there is n.eed of someone to perform the work done by \Jim the Copper.'' Last Saturday afternoon. duri~g the football game on the Campus, the unruly ~lement was much in evidence. Profanity and vulgarity plentifully adorned th~ remarks of this class and the few ~tudents pr~~ent were unable to prevent the occur- rence of such distasteful manifestations of rowdyism. Evidently the word has been. passed around among the young roughs or the city that there is no po.liceman on ··~-., ............ ~ the college grounds, for almost every afternoon gangs of these precious fellows gather on the plot between the Ill chapel and the fraternity houses to the east and south and render the neighborhood a pleasant one. That more seri· ous results have :not come from this unhindered invasipn .of college property is due more to good. luck than to good management. In evidence of this statement we produce the following instance. One afternoon a crowd of the.se youngsters were having a fine time in front of the residence of a member of the faculty. Observing that a window of the second story, opening on the roof of a porch, was raised, they at once concluded to explore the interior of the house and had even succeeded in reaching the roof of the porch by climbing a pillar when an observer in the next house put a stop to further operations by calling out his remonstrances. We have since learned that had· there been no observer they would have been able .to pilfer from the room in question as the professor was absent and that part of the house tern porarily deserted. \On a Sunday afternoon,\ conditions were bad enough when an officer was on duty,- but this fall-well the less said the better. The students desire to make this inquiry which they deem pertinent but in no way impertinent. Why can we not have a special officer on the college grounds 1 Am or. A child of the raging ocean, Born of the sparkling foam, A pink sea shell, with its curving bell Thy cradle, and shelter and home? A glistening wave thy pillow, No nurse but the langorous wind, With its soothing tone, for thy first moan And its wail when thou wert unkind? Or art thou an angel from Heaven, Thou rapturous spirit of love, With thy rustle of wings for the heart that sings At the birth of a joy from above ? Whichever thou art, 0 Presence ! Remain with me now I implore For once I was thine but now thou art mine, I'll keep thee, love, now evermore. H., 'o3.

A gr<aat deal of interest was manifested Sat- turday in the game of association football which was played -on the ca.mpus between the British Colonies and ~he World. The inter- national team won by the score of 3 to o. The game is a strange one to most Ameri- cans and its plays seemed purposeless and ridiculous to those adtnirers of the American game who watched the ~game. The constant stopping of play for a reason that could not be perceived by those unfamiliar with the game, at le~st made the game appear to be much slower. A greater number of men play than in regu- lar football. There are 15 on a side. Neither side has the ball in a scrimmage as the ball is tossed between them as they are lined up. The ball is both kicked and carried and when a runner is tackled he passes the ball to ~nother on his side if possible, or if he is alone he attempts ~o kick it. Forward pass€s are not allowed. The passing is much the satne as in basketball. To score it is necessary to get the ball be- tween the two goal posts but it is not necessary to get it over the bar. ''Biddy \ Paige, Union's star fullback of '99, 'oo, and 'oi played on the team represent- ing the World. On Wednesday afternoon Nov. 12 the Fresh- man .football team met the strong Junior team on the college gridiron. Expectation ran high and a large cro,vd of undergraduates thronged the ''side lines.'' Captain Sawyer of the Freshman team won the toss and chose to de- fend the south goa-l, which he did admirably the Juniors failing to score in the first half. In the second half the Freshn1en kicked off and Lawsing advanc.ed the ball. The Juniors played their usual snappy game as in the first half and the freshmen again failed to score. Time was called. Score o-o. The Freshmen played on the whole the bet- ter offensive game, but were outclassed by the Jurki:ors in strategetic plays. It was in trtith a tritLriph of brain over brawn. Notwithstanding: this, Clark's Hue bucking for the Juniors was a featttre of the game, as was Cool's work at left ' guard. For Freshrnen everybody did good work ; no particu]ar cases can be cited.

'fh_e editor of the 1904 Garnet would like to call to the atten~ion of every student the fact that there is ample opportunity for every.one to coH tribute material either literary or artistic to this;. year's annual. The idea seems too preva~ lent that all the material is to be contributed,. by tlle board of ~ditors personally, while as a matter of fact the duty of the latter is rather to collect and arrange contributions from the entire student body. Let every one who has any 1 iterary, artistic or even satirical ability, hand in something to the board. All art con-· tri:b-u tions must be in before the Christmas re- cess.

Illustrated.] A vivid, picturesque story of a typ,ical ·western family of wealth settling in New York and of their attempt to scale the citadels of society and of Wall street. Old Peter Bines with his sound business judg~ ment and quaint sayings is a worthy eKam- ple of the David Harum class of rugged great hearted Americans. For his startling unconventionalistn the author has won respect and has rendered '' The Spenders\ a first class book with which to spend the evening. [The Unspeakable Scot. By T. W, H. Crosland, New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons.] 1\his book is avowedly a revolt against the prominent part played by the Scotch in all lin~s of activity in England. It cites exatn- ples of the undue respect for the Scot, which the author calls ''the superstition\ and th~n jt p~~ceeds to sho~v that his character is worthy of

THE 0'0NCORDIENSIS. 13. nothing but scorn; The author dwells 01,1 the uselessness of the Scot as a statesn1an, ,man of let~f!rS and n1an of business, and t1ot con- tent with that points out that he is a dipso- maniac and quotes statistics to prove the large percentage of cdminals among the Scotch. Burns is treated to a whole ch.apter of unfav- orable com111ent, while Scott and Carlyle are disposed of in a couple o:f paragraphs. The book is cleverly written, affords many a good laugh and is especially interesting to those, who like Mr. Crosland, are somewhat tired of the race best known by its dialect, its kilts and its bag· pi pes. [Pine Tree Ballads. By Holman F. Day. BostoR: Small, .Maynard & Co.] An exceedingly bright little book of verse, full of quiet hutnor and patl1os. It deals with life up in J\1aine and many of the verses are in Yankee dialect. '' As Eesee1neth ]\lien \ is a tribute to the sin1ple bravery of Glo'ster fish- ers and is, to say the least, stirring. ''The Knight of the Spike-Sole Boots\ easily arouses our syp1pathy and admiration for the Maine lumberman. Humor is abundant all through, especially in the sections \ Our I-Ion1e Folks '' and ''Songs of the Sea and Shore.\ It is a little surprising that an author who sho·ws so much sympathy and optimism should under the heading \Just Hutnan Nature\ group selec- tions showing only the n1ean and low qualities of hurnan nature. It is certainly a deservedly popular book. · [In the Eagle's Talon. A Romance of the Louisiana Purchase, By Sheppard Stevens. Illustrated by A. Rus· sell, Little, Brown & Co., Boston.] Of historical novels the reading public has had a surfeit hut whenever an author finds a fresh field and has the ability to cr,eate distinct types the ,book is eagerly read. ''In the Ect;gle's Talon\ certainly presents these recom- mendations. In the earlier portion of the st~ry the artistic portrayal of French Ameri- can life· in old Louisiana recalls the best of Maurice T:hompson in \Alice of Old Vincen- nes.'' A breath of sorr.ow frotn far aw~y France brings vividly a picture of the bloody days of terror and causes the hero Louis Lafreniere to cross the ocean on a miss ion of rescue. No stronger scene has been portrayed for years than the stonny interview between Napoleon then Eirst Consul and his sister the treacherous Mn1e Marat. The exciting revela- tion of the identity of persecutor of Louis' fair cousin and the ingenious way in which La- freniere e1n ploys a great diplomatic mission for his own rescue, hold the interest of the reader and excite his sympathies for the lead- ing characters. The story is very readable and the publishers have taken every pains to render the book attractive. S. B. H.'o3 [Letters from a Self- Made Merchant to his Son. By George Horace Lorimer. Illustrations by F. R. Gruger and B. Martin Justice. Boston; Small, Maynard & Co.) \A collection of letters written by John :Graham, head of the house of Grah~m & Com- pany, Pork Packers in Chicago, and familiarly , known ' on 'change' as '.Old Gorgon Gra- ham,' to l1is son, Pierrepont, facetiously • known to his intimates as ' Piggy.' \ As an exposition of American HuJ:l?.or and Sound Sense these letters are noteworthy. The practical experience of the father is used to curb the theoretical suggestions of the son and the reader can trace the evolution of the business instinct and of a strong character in Mr. Pierrepont until the father turns him over to a nice girl at the close of the story. This book should appeal to every college tnan and is worthy(){ a place beside his histories and classics. Howard R. · Glutzbeck, ex 'o4, vvas a 'visitor on the hill last week. Otto von Dannenberg, _, o6, w a.s taken to the Ellis hospital last Thursday. He is threatened with a serious attack of typhoid fever.

I , . i ' 14 I ( THE '00NOORDIENSIS. COLLEGE VER·SE. The Actror. The actor who behiad the footlights stands And Shakespea·re's work portrays 'with skill and art Both lives mid scenes three centuries ago And mingles oft with princes, knights and kings. He walks and talks with men of great renown And lords and kings and warriors all alike H.e knows full well this hero famed of old. \Vith Exeter, Gloucester, York, all heroes bra,,e, He speaks and counsel sensible and sound Doth give, and they his each desire fulfill. And oftimes on some far-famed battlefield Like Crecy-Calais-Argincourt-he fights, Or draws his s:word in some fair lady's name. Of ancient times, and places famed for aught Of history or hero's noble deed He knows full well, and in all ages lives And visits oft-on Shakespeare's stage and knows Both Venice, Athens, Egypt's Nile-fed vale. The well-paved street and bloody battle field Are both a home to him-this hero brave. All the$e he knows and just as well knows R~me And Pisa with its lofty miracle. To make love well knows how or with heroic hand To draw the keenedged blade in righteous cause. Among the nobles too of highest birth He goes, and with the kings and famous men Doth live-And he the foremost man of aU. Thus on the stage and well he plays his part The crowd applauds and praise his every deed, And when the curtain falls and hides their view, He passes from the stage and is no more. ' ~ A hero on the ancient field to fight No more with kings and warriors bold to dwell. No more to tread the street of ancient town, No lady fair from rival's hand to save. :But lives and is with us and we with him: And each the other knows as man knows man. In this-the present time-today he lives, And off the stage of Shakespeare plays his part vYhh us in the great theatre of Life. R. W. C. Schenectady, N.Y., Nov. 15, 1902. The \Politicker.\ \Vho is it comes to you with winning smile, Invoking your aid, and seeming sans guile, Whose fond heart grows fonder, as,day succeeds day, \Vho warbles a plaintive and musical lay, Of favors he's granted and others in store 1 Of \old times,\ ''true friendship\ and reasons a score, vVhy you ought to. stand by him ; push him to the fore? The \ Politicker.\ \Vho is he who swears by the Holy Writ ''Your stick is unjust ;'' \that Prof. should soon quit.\ Who pets you and pats you and laughs at your joke, Who peddles out promises built upon smoke ; But passes you by without even a grin vVhen election is over and votes are all in, \Vho forgets all about you, if he happens to win?

fw10DERN FEETBALL. Iiow to Play It. From the Chicago Tr·ibune. LESSON II.-THE CENTRE RUSH. The qualifications of the centre rush are beef, a thick skull and good teeth. Any man with the instincts of a bulldog and qualified to kill steers at the stockyards would 1nake a good centre rush. Some centres stand with one foot behind the other, son1e on both feet, but the best stand with both feet on the opposing play- er's neck. The centre starts the play. He should snap the ball quickly with one hand, while with the other he craftily twists the ear of his opponent. He should then lunge forward, raise his head sharply and butt his opponent on the nose guard. When playing on the defensive he should use his head as a battering ran1. If his opponent plays low he should reach over and bite him. If his teeth are good he can hold his opponent and at the same time wave both arn1s to show the umpire that his opponent is holding. When a man is bit hard in the arm, he usually grabs the 1nan who bit hin1. This· gives the centre a charice to wave both arn1s and attract the official's notice, and it often re- sults in gaining ten yards because the other man is holding.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. xx·vr. UNION COLLEGE, NOVEMBER 26, 1902 .. No.9. DELTA PHI RE-UNION And 75th A11niversary 1827-1902. The celebration of the 75th anniversary of the founding of th.e Delta Phi fraternity began with the informal eeception and \open house\ tendered :rvionday afternoon, Nov. 17th, by the members of the Alpha chapter at their house at 759 Nott Street. About 40 1nen from the other chapters attended and were well entertained by the Union men. On the san1e evening abont 7 5 Delta Phians assembled at Hotel 'fen Eyck, Albany, for the anniversary dinner and re-union. The ball- room, in which the banquet was held, was tastily trimmed with Bostpn ferns, potted plants, chrysanthen1un1s and college flags. Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Rutgers, Lehigh, Brown, University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, New York University, Rensselaer Polytechnic and Union were well represented. Men whose sons bad already graduated from college and the pr()verbial ''green \ freshman sat side by side on tenns of the greatest inti- macy. 1viusic was furnished by Prof. Holding's orchestra and, when at intervals the strains of some familiar colleKe or fraternity air came floating from behind the barrier of ferns, old and young would take up the strain and swell the chorus until the \valls echoed andre-echoed . agatn. When the inner tnan was more than satis- fied, James Duane Livingston, Delta, '7 6, de- livered the address of welcome in his usual, graceful manner. Toasts were then respond- ed to as follo\vs: \Our Fratern:ty,'\ John W. Searing. ''The Sister Chapters,\ William L .. Hodges, Psi '94· ''Lambda,\ The<>dore Moore, Lam bela, '7o, \Delta Phi as She is To-day,\ Philip M. Brett, Epsilon, '88. ''The Old Bridge,'' Frederick vV. Cameron, Alpha, '77. At the close all united in singing \ Auld Lang Syne.\ Tuesday the Lan1bda chapter of the Rensse- laer Polytechnic Institute, assumed the duties of host and entertained in her usual excellent style. Those who know La1nbda realize what that ''usual \ means. At noon more than forty sat down to enjoy a surpassingly good luncheon and a still greater number were pres- ent at the reception held in the evening at the fraternity house. Among those Union men at the exercises ·were: Ed·ward \V. Can1eron, Frederick W. Cameron, Evan R. Cullings, 'oo; Philip S. Dorion, J. B. Dupuy, I-I. V. Mynderse, Wil- liatn 'r. B. Mynderse, C. B. ~facMnrray, Chas. H. Mills, '72; J. \V. ,Parry, W. C. Roberson, Frank H. N enter, '78; rr. 'N. Powell, 'o3; _ J. L. Staeber, 'o3; Albert I-I. Keesler, 'o3; Harry R. Andress, 'o4; Earl \V. ~!'Quirk, 'os; J. T. vVarren, 'os; Daniel Itnrie, 'o6; Lee F. I-Ieacock, 'o6; Floyd L. Miller, 'o6; Prof. Sidney G. Ashmore, John DeWitt Pelts, R. C. Prince. Taken all together the celebration of the 75th anniversary was a very successful affair and much credit is due to the Alpha and Lamb- da chapters on whom devolved most of the responsibility. 1\'hat Delta Phi may continue in her present prosperity is the earnest wish of every man in Union college.

On Thursday evening the combined Glee and Mandolin Clubs gave a concert at Red Men's Hall in Scotia. Owing to rival attrac- tions the concert was not as well attended as might have been desired. A few changes in the program as published last week were made so that it is here ap·p'ei\ded: PROGRAM. 1. 11 Winter Song,\ (Bullard)-Glee Club. 2. \ Harrgony Mose,\ (M\ills)-Mandolin Club. 3. Cornet Solo. (Selected)-Mr. Rulison. 4· ''~he Mill,''-Glee Club. 5. The Happy Harp in '' Warmed Over Smiles.\ Char· acteristic sketch with the kind assistance of the Professor. R. W. Clark, '04. 6. Hal Hal Miss Lindy. (Steele)-Mr. 1\iulleneaux and Glee Club. 7. The Mississippi Bubble (Haines). 8. The Story of a Tack. (Anon)-Quartet. 9· Cornet Duet. (Selected)-Messrs. Rulison ·and Lund· gren. ro. Terrace Song (Ludlow, '56)-M~r. Mulleneaux and Glee Club. The instrumental club is in fine condition, barring the necessity of using their n'otes on the stage. Among the best rendered numbers on the program were numbers 3 and 6. The cornet solo by Mr. Rulison was pleasing and his tones are very clear and mellow, lacking that harsh sound so often noticeable in the work of amateur cornetists. By far the best work done by the Glee Club was in n4inber 6. The chorus is a rollicking one, an ideal college club song, and the baritone solo voice was admirably sustained by Mr. Mull~neaux. While not a strict success from the financial point of view, the beriefits derived from this public practice are of no little ~dvaritage to all men on the club. An appre·ciative delega- tion from the hill attended the concert. KAPPA ALPHA RECEPTION.

SHUTS OUT UNION And Wins by a Score of 1·8 to o. \Vith the grand stand and bleachers packed to overflowing, the largest crowd that has ever witnessed a football game at University Heights saw the New York University boys defeat the Union College eleven Saturday, at ·Ohio Field, by a score of I8 to o.

New York's tackles, were shoved through the gaps for large gains. · ·; New Y·ork ·scored twice iri· the first half and once in the second. In the first period New York kicked off to the visitors, who caught the ball on their 3o-yarcl line. Almost at once they made thirty yards on an end run.. New York got the baH at midfi,eld, but losing- it on a fumble, Union made another large gain and ahnost scored a touchdown on a trick play. On her ro-:yard line New· York braced, got the ball on downs, and on well directed mass plays worked the pigskin down to· Union's zo-yard mark. Here a· trial for a field goal went wide. Union punted it to the centre of the field, but they could advance the ball no further. New York's line held them for downs, and the local teatn rushed the oval do·wn the field. Rielley \Vas pushed over for a touchdown. Connelly kicked the goal. On the line-up again New York rapidly worked the ball down toward Union's goal by steadily hammering the 0pposing line. Union obtained the ball on her 2o-yard line. Here the leather ·went frotn one slde to the other on bad fumbles by both teams. New York finally scored a second touchdown, due to large gains by fine line handling by Lane. Connelly kicked the goal. In the second half Union's offensive playing at first was so aggressive that the visitors car\ ried the ball to New York's 2o-yard line. Here occured the feature of the gatne. N. Y. U. had the ball. . On a second pass MacDowell, by a quick sprint around Union's right end obtained a clear field. A Union man gave chase, but c·ould ·not ove·rtake the fleeing runner, who planted the pigskin in squarely between Union's goal posts after a run of ninety yards. 'l'he greatest enthusiasm prevailed. rrime was.called a few, minutes later on accou~t of darkness with the ball in Union's possession on New York's ten yard line. The line-up. N.Y. U. ·union.

Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. Thanksgiving. The Board of Editor~ wishes you one and all a happy Thanksgiving vacation. May. the turkey be larger, fatter, and sweeter than ever before. Have you ever thought how much a student at Union has to be thankful for? Let us reckon up. In the first place we should be thankful for this grand old college which has withstood all the buffets and storms that have swept over· her for nearly five scqre and ten years. And this gallant fight on and on through the years has been of singular honor to those men whose names are written on Union's roll of fame, for, unltke the other old colleges in the United States, Union has had~ to depend for her exist· ence not on the lavish munificence of men of great wealth but largely upon the earnest and self-sacrificing labors of her alumni. . This brings us to a second. cause for thanksgiving, the alumni. Pid you ever realize how much the alumni are doing for us? A material instance of their constant regard for our welfare is the beautiful building .given for the use of the stadents by Dr. Silliman ; another e~ample is the stately :f\.Iemorial Hall which had its origin in the ,mind of ahother alumnus, and whose completion is now a surety throagh the efforts of other alumni in appealing to the great generosity of the Hon. !vfr. Carnegie. Did you ever express your thanks by word or by action to the Board of Trustees for their gifts to you? Did you ever realize that in years past these same gentlemen of the Board of Trustees have subscribed handsome sums of money to aid in paying the debt of Union? Are you properly thankful to the management of the institution because it has placed Union on a sound financial basis and has solved in the main the problem of problems, how to manage the college within her income? But if we were to enumerate all of the things for which the Union College man can be grateful this tlJ.anksgi:ving_, it would not be possible for this issue to be published a day earlier as is our intention this week. Let it be enough if everyone acknowledges down at the bottom of his heart that it is a mighty good thing to live but a s~ill mightier blessing to live at Union. N OTICE.-The next number of the Concordiensis will be. issued Wednesday, Dec. roth. The Plea of a Fish. Please, Mister, handle me gently, You don't realize how you hurt. You scrape off my scales so intently, And expect me to lie here, inert. You cut off my fins without mercy, vVith never a thought of my pain. Before you go further, have pity, And deaden my agonized brain. Don't let me lie here and suffer Because I am only a fish, With one single blow you can kill me, And grant a poor Cod's dying wish. J.

'1.4 rrHE OONCORDIENSIS. BARNEY SHANDON-HERO. The English quarter of Calcutta seemed de- serted that day. Only an old Hindu snake charmer was on the street, with his le,opard skin and covered basket. A couple of trained cobras went through a series of wriggling antics, to the shrill piping of a reed flute. In this manner the fakir picked up a few pennies, for seven officers of the English army were at this moment lounging on the piazza of a bun- galo. There was no drill for the infantry that day. The parade ground was being used by the Sixth battery of field artillery. Suddenly the snake charmer gave a cry of startled terror. The Englishmen jutnped to their feet. Was sotnething going to happen which would change the monotony of the day? A sight which might inspire any soldier met their gaze. 'fearing madly down the street was a gun limber drawn by four snorting h·orses. The Englishmen craned their necks to see the better. It was not the first time that a gun drill had been interrupted by the running away of some frightened horses. The old fakir remained rooted to the spot. A warning cry went up from the piazza as the horses drew near. But at the instant the leaders were within a few yards of him a horse and rider dashed up to the runaways. As the Englishmen stood dumbfounded, the rider s'Yung his horse before the frightened animals. vVith a supreme effort he seized the terror- stricken Indian and w'heeled to the right just Fearey's Tru{itf at$ J.SO is puffing a good many $5.00 Shoes out of business in a race for STYLE.

This was the first time they had seen him, Barney Shandon, lieutenant of the Sixth Artil- lery, late lieutenant of the Catnpbell Horse. He was about twenty-six years of age, tan, broad-shouldered, and as he strode up the steps of the bungalo he looked a typical officer of the line. His kahki blouse \vas open, one gauntlet was missing, \vhile his boots were cov- . ered with brown dust. He carried neithe.1 sabre nor revo;lver. \Hot work,\ he exclain1ed, with a strong brogue, throwing himself into a rocking chair. ''That was an absurd thing ~to do,\ said · Lieutenant Melrose, lighting a cigarette. ''I wouldn't risk my life the way you did for all the niggers in the country. '' The Irishman said nothing, but assumed a I more cotnfortable position by placin'g his feet on the piazza railing. He was not tlre least bit agreeable, and the longer he stayed the more the Englishmen becan1e convinced that he did not belong to their social set. Several half audible con1n1ents were made as to what should be done with this seemingly illiterate compan- ion. At last one said : \I say, vyhy don't you say something? ~There did you come from, anyhow?'' '• From London.

'1'here are severai kinds of guards, atnong which may be mentioned rear guard, advance guard, nose guard, shin guard, right guard, left guard, elevated railroad guard, guard of honor, body guard, black guard, watch guard, · guard mount, and the thing on a carving fork to keep you from cutting yourself. 1~his article, however, hds to do only with the right and left guards in a feetball eleven. They are supposed to have originated in hu- man beings with intelligence, and on the hoof should not weigh less than 22 5 net. T'he guards are put on either side of the centre, and are called guards because they are not. Guards should be taught to cultivate all the instincts of an automobile, except they must not give the customary ·warning of impending slaughter. In order to prevent this the cow- catcher or pilot\\ of a guard is made of heavy leather straps and a gutn arrangen1ent with a gag on the lower end which is jamtned be- tween the guard's teeth vvhen he is not biting his opponent. Any gent with the instincts of a pile driver and the tender sensibilities of a punching bag should make a good guard. In offense he should be an irresistible force, in defense an immovable body. Our next article will explain the duties of tackles. American Montl1ly Review of Revie,vs How Can l Keep Up With the Times?
