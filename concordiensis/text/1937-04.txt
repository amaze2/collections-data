'There are the ncitals by the Rice String Quc-utet, the Frida: . .:, Saturday and Sunday mu.sical progTams l>y Dr. Tid- marsh, the Tuesda~· Capehart symphonic l\e- cm·dings, and the various activities of musi- cal clubs on and off the campus. The Freidrich Shorr concert he1·e on Apl'il 16 will serve to give greater impetus to this tendency. As an example of a temperament that lias unemban·as.sed respect for his audi- ence, l\Ir. Shon· intends giving his concert free to the students and to take advantage of the opportunity to spend tlvo days at the college where he had such an enjoyable time five years ago. The concert provides an op- portunity for kue social advancement that Union College has rarely had. It is an oppor- tunity worth accepting. DR. FOX I~NOORSES Ifli'~URANCE Dr. Dudd, president of Princeton Univer- sity, after endm·sing the plan of endowment insurance by gr~duation classes, announced that nearly $100,000 would accrue to his col- lege in 1941. Other colleges have also taken up this policy wherein each succeeding class insures the college of an income. That col- leges exist only in part from the income de- rived by tuition is a well established fact. Generally the expenses are covered from en- dowments and gifts, which are in most cases the result of the g;enerosity of alumni. This situation exists at Union as well as else- whel'e. Perhaps it might be well to state that in most places these endowments ex- ceed the bare necessity of covering expenses. They contribute t()wards the construction of new buildings .and creation tlf additional THE CONOORDIENS~S, FRIDi\. Y, APRIL 2, 1937 scholarships.

If it is possible to typifr a jUnion man, we would include among his characteristics that he is a man of moderate means. A movement to lay the foundations for an insurance plan here are already uhder was, us a result of the efforts of a few interested students. Th.e organization of a larger com- mittee in Ol'der to facilitate th.e synthesizing of this proposal among ft·aternity n:1en and neutrals is nearly completed, and it will be- g-in its w01·k among the seniors shortly after · The siK.teen lights in the 1ibt•ary have been lighted for a week ll.O\V,. but ·we have just begun to figure out why. We are told, on the adminis- tration's part, that the floodlights were using qp too much of the col- lege's Electricity -40 per cent, or something like that; but .deep down within us a .little voice keeps reminding us that F.

One of the many . kappa. Nu's. • bu::;iness ventures a yeung maH eal 1 ly finds · himself involved in is insurance. Business executives as well as economic theorists are almost universal in their agreement that in- surance is a necessary ·investment. We do · not propose to cite its benefits here, for we hope that this committee will acquaiHt ~11 · those who are interested in it with thern. Howevet· we are interested in seeing that the embet·s of the original enthusiasm for this insurance do not die. From time to time we will fan them to a greater g-low with illuminating articles on insurance, which should be of interest to everyone, seniors as well as freshmen. It is necessary that the impetus of this mov.ement be wide spread and for that reason a conce1·ted effort is be- ing- made to include as many as possible in it. Dr. Fox has already given the plan a wo·rd of approval, as have several members of the faculty. Moreover it will have the backing of a great number of farsighted and thinking students, and to the rest, if they will make an attempt to understand the principles of insurance, will come a growing impression of its impmtance. The uses to which the emoluments from the insumnce policies can he put are numer- ous and necessary. For instance there at·e the glaring needs for an improved medical office, au athletic field house, squash com·ts. \Vith 1·enova,tions in South College, the model student's room of a century ago in no1 th seclioh will have to be dismantled. :Ell t antique ·1ove1.s and historians need not f1:et yet, There are still fifteEn re>oms in soudh section. • • We went to hear Honorary F'el'low Pound the other ni!,lht at Prexy's, and ·enjoyed ourselves.

We cannot resist this final, futile gesture to criticize the administration on its reti- cence to discuss the issue of extra-curricular activity. The relationship of the outside work students undertake and academic wmk they mus.e over has pre-eminently existed for a g-ood number of years. Each adminis- • tration has failed, when it has made an ef- fort to consider the question at all, to pl·e- sent a satisfactory proposal to the students. If we did not feel that the students were being made dupes of a great fraud, we would not bother to raise the point. However they are. One of the gr.eat hues and cries in the modern liberal education program is that generally hurled at participation in extl·a- cmricular activities. Most college presidents . inRist that it is an absolutely necessity to in- . elude a wide range of activities for students. But they do not mention, much less stress the sacrifice students make in their curricu- lar work in order to indulg·e in all that the college offers. This practice seems a bit raw on the unsuspecting students. And at Other Colleges .•.

On the. contrary, the outlook has considevably ·brightened, not only in view of the big scmes Union de· feated its opponents last year, but also in view of the surpt•isingly good showing of ·many of the track and field men. Alan Van Wert, for exam·ple, has been showing some fine fot·m in the, pole vault, while Harry Myers is coming t·ight wlong in that event. Since Emery Burton has gone, the brunt of the pole vaulting will t·est on these ·men for the next two sea- sons. Thet·e is a third man, Renni Pommatti, iritramutal pole vault champ, who may turn out to be a good man-if he comes out fm· practice. The shot put is still a trouble- some event for Coach Ketz. Fmnk Gatchell, Chuck Chapin and Frank Freihofer still have to show more improvement Kreusi is the onl;y man who can handle the discus, but he does his job on first-rate basis and a second man is almost negligtble.

Senior Classes of Skidmore and Sage Will Attend Concert and All-College Dance; Bakers Hold Reception Union College, like \Life\, will go to a party tonight--one of the first all-college parties in some time. Tonight at 8 dclock Friedrich Schorr, premier Wagnerian baritone of the liietr()politan Opera Company, will give the college a personal gift of a c0ncert consisting mainly of Wag- nerian W(}rks and German lieder. A capacity audience of stu- dents, faculty Inembers and their guests is expected to jam the l\Iemorial Chapel. ~~------------------------·<$> The senior classes of Skidmore . and Russell Sage Colleges will be the guests of Union·~ ~enior cla,;s at the concert and at an all-college dance afterward in the Alumni Gymnasium. The dance is con- ducted by the Terrace Council, with the Tax Committee supplying the funds. Bakel'S \Viii Receive Following the concert, Mr. and Mrs. Walter C. Baker of New York will give a reception for Ml', and Mrs. Schorr in Hale House. The guests will be the faculty, the Stu- dent ·Council, the Terrace Council, the Glee Club and their guests. In order to give tonight's concet't, Mr. Schorr relinquished several other engagements. He sang here in 1932, through the courtesy of the Bakers, in a benefit concert to aid needy students, and he returns this year \to renew friend~hips with the . faculty members and to make friends with the new generation of college students,\ FRIEDRICII SCHORR Not only a leader among inter- pr!\ters of iVngner·, ML Schorr is nlso a noted oratorio soloist and lieder singer. Born in Hungary and educated as a lawyer, he turned to opera as a career. At the age of 22 he was given a contract with Arast Opera Company, After four years with them he traveled to P1·ague and Colog11e, singing with opera <'ompanies of both of tr<lse cities, He made his first Amedcan app~amnce in 1~23 with the Ger- man Opera Company. During the 1<ame year he became a member of the Metropolitan Opera Associa- tion. Mr. Schorr sang at the Con- vent Garden, London, in 1924, After hearing him, the Ring and Queen requested a aomrnand performance. Souvl\nir Program Mrs. Baker· will present the guests at the concert with a sou- venir program, including portraits of Mr. Schon, his biographical sl{etch, and tran~lations of the G!'nnan lieder and program note~ by Anna Pel\iam Danton, wife of Dr. George H. Danton. Accompanied by Fritz Kitzinger, Mr. Schorr will sing four groups of songs. He will o:pen with a group by Franz Schubert, \The Wanderer, to the Moon,'' \ln Evening's Glow,\ \By the Sea,\ and \To the Infinite God\. Next will come a group of songs by Johannes Brahms; \My Queen, How Art Thou Rapturous\ \Fair Was What I P10ffered Thee\ \Sweet Loneliness of Fields\ and \0 Lovely Cheeks\. The third group will consist of English songs, \It rs Enough\ from Mendelssohn's \Elijah\, \The Blind (Continued on Page 3) Revived, Resuscitated; Repolished, New IdolPrQbes 'The Academic Mind' By ROBERT If. FERGUSON \Revived resuscitated, refurbish- ed and repolished,\ The Idol ap- peared on {be carnpus this week vastly changed In appearance, somewhat changed in content. Most startling feature is the cover decor- ated with a photogra:ph of a plas- tel'-of-paris model of a brain, bear- ing the caption, \The Academic Mind.\ In large type on the second page is an inscrilltion; \not for the peo- ple who can't take it.\ The editors promise that \The Idol will print anything worth reading which seems to make sense and obey the laws of grammar. \It has no patience with institu- tions or people whose behavior and intellects stammer. \It does not pretend to be right, or artistic, or oracUlar. \It will do its damndest to ap- pear on time.\ Although not fulfiiling the last promise, as the magazine appeared on April 13 with a March 15 date line, The Idol lives up to its ideals fairly well. Dedicated to the Fac- ulty, most of the rdol's content con- cerns that body, the principal fea- ture being a two page spread of pictures and verse entitled, \The Ladder of Learning.\ Other comment on Union's pro- fessors is found in a series of let- ters entitled \Dear Professor\ and in a column entitled \Not That It Matters.\ This latter feature is ob- viously patterned after the \Notes and Comment\ of The New Yorlter magazine, but falls far short of its origin\al in merit. However it is the most interesting feature of the magazine, combining as it does whimsical fancies and shar:p-edged editorializing. The four shot·t stories contained in the cu!'l'ent issue are well done and interesting, despite their tend- ency towards the psycopathic. Fred Frost contributed· \No Plan Unal- tered\ a penetrating study of a domineering mothel'. From Tony Sharpe came a trilogy entitled \Ruralia.\ S- Ralph Cohen's \Re- volt at Union\ analyzes the lack of interest in revolutionary ideas shown by the college and suggests as the answer the homogenity of the student body and students' ab- soption in earning their way through college. Poetry contributed by S. Ralph Cohen, Ferdinand Helm, Henry Seider, and John Davis, is similar to that contained in pvevious is- sues. Essentially immature in con- tent and style, it is the least at- tractive feature of the magazine.

SHORR BRINGS US INTEREST Tonight we welcome on the podium of our chapel one of the g1·ea:ts in the t·ealm of voic<> culture. Everyone, we thin!<, is familiar with the magnanimity of l\Ir. Schorr in pl'esent- ing for our benefit this concert. It certainlr cannot be interpreted other than as a g·esture of his deep feeling for a faith of all that is fine and noble at Union. And in no less a degree can we lll!Lke him feel our :sincere ap:pt·eciation by acting a part, the part of a good listener. We cannot help thinking that when 1\Ir. Schorr first fills the chapel with the reson- ances of his beautiful voice we are contem- plating a singer who is no \vhit less a man. The fact that he has a voice, richly devel- oped, indicates that he has a live inter-est in what so few of us evet· participate, life's best. lf it 1s at all corl'ect to create the illusion of an average college man, we would say that he was one, a little better equipped than the ordinary men of the streets to combat the realities of life. He is grimly determined that life feeds on material things, and ma- terial things alone. One, by stretching the imagination may accuse him of' po~sessing- ll really full fledged interest in hb struggle for existence, but at [)est it is a most unsatis- factory one. He may pursue the mundane contentedly, but we could scarcely say hap- pily. 1\Ian needs an il1terest, which presup- poses and demands emotional susceptibility, in order to enjoy the fruits of his living. And it is this interest wl1ich 1\Ir. Schon· exhibits in singing and having persons hear him sing C'IVIL SERVICE REFORM The purport of l\Ir. Johnson's message the other day in chapel awakened in us a rea:liza- tion of ho\· totally inadequate and incom.pe- tent our \spoils system\ is to handle the great job of t·unning ou1· govemment. Wbat the present system is tantamount to is tnat when a person does not make the grade in business or in some p1·ofessions l1e turns to government work. Young men fl'esh out of college cannot unde1· the present scheme seek the higher civil service jobs. Befoee they can even take the exams they must have had ex- perience. Thus for the most part it is per- sons who fail in theil' first attempts at busi- ne:;s who take up g·overnment work as the only other alternative. This thought inte11ests u::; a great deal. If we wm1t to be considered part of the thinking public, we .should enlist ourselves with others of our kind in order to take stet)s to remedy this anomaly. It is to those trained in experience and tutored in lmowledg·e to whom we should entrust our destiny. Too long now have we depended on political pawns with checkered careel'S to protect om· interest:-:;, Vv'e can find no more worthy cause to fight fo1· than this one. Let us join fol'ces with l\h·. Johnson. TO OUR BAAL The appeal'a.nce of the greatly discussed Idol on the campus has brought comments from many sources, some malignant while olht>r::> al'l' praisev>orthy.

Says he, \I think they covered .the faculty of Washburn Hall fairly well.\ We ag-ree with him and we should !·ike to add that they, in many instances, were not particularly accurate. -For one the Dowling- Coffin incident was colored with the wrong paint. And as \Not That It Matters!' th{mght the whole incident \just a little sordid, and even, perhaps pedantic,\ we think It was, on one side a bit impudent, and on the other QUite tactfuL At any rate, we wish the Idol would quote such· little scenes correctly hereafter. * We take this from tl1e Newavk, N, J., News, March 20, 1937. It goes as follows: \Fun's fun, but wait till Foster Brown of Maplewood catches the fellow Kappa Alpha who's responsible for this one. F·oster'a at Union College and the other day he received a telegram, 'Will it be convenient If I come up Friday' signed by his current flame in Short Hills. Foster wired baclt fifty wo~ds of bliss and an hour later received another mes- sage, 'What's this all about? Are you crazy? Ann.' \ * * * Despite the long time during which they so valiantly tried to hook an orchestt·a, we think the Prom Committee made an excellent choice in Russ Morgan's Phillip Morris Band. His music is noted for that disti-nc- tiveness :and correctness that makes \Music In the Morgan Manner\ so popular among the critics. Says the New York Daily Mirt,or critic, Nick Kenny, one of the better radio reviewers, \among those rec;omme~d~d is Russ Morgan's terrific arrangements on his Tuesday mght ctggte hour!\ We know that a few cynics still criticize the Prom Committee for their choice. We'd! like them to listen in some Tuesday night over WGY at &:00 and if they're dissatisfied by 8:30 we'll •buy these cynics a bunch of grapes. \ROUND and ROUND\ B:y CHRIS CAMMACK We're still raving about Tommy Dorsey's \Marie whicb has some of the cleverest arranging we've ever heard. With a vocal by Jack Leonard, and a smoothly swinging male ch<lrus background, the 'band> does itself proud. On the reverse side is a swing a!'l'angement of \Son~· of India,\ als<l in the best Dorsey manner, with plenty of pol- ish to it. A Victor record, and try and get hold of it. Victor 25523. \They Can't Take That Away From Me,\ with \I've Got Rain in My Eyes\ on the reverse, should become very popular. We heard them down south, where the for- mer was in great damend. Perhaps a little too much .brass, but that's a matte:r· of taste. Another T. Dor- sey number with excellent vocaling by Jack Leonard and Edyth Wrig-ht. Victor Z!i549. Ruby Newman and his outfit have cut the wax with \Where or When\ and \Johnny One-Note.' \Where or When\ has. really got somethiEg, which another band might have brought out in a better way. However, this is good, as is the vocal. We don't think so much of \Johnny One-Note,\ but again, tastes differ. ViCtor 25546. Glen Gray and his Casa Lama Band have given what we consider their best in \Study In Brown,\ with \Whoa Eabe\ on the reverse, \Study in Brown\ brings a new meanmg to the word \swing and we lilte the meaning. The whole band works together, with some grand sax wcrk and .plenty of hot up-work. A \must get\ for any .. s..ving\ ·collection. Reverse is also good. Decca 1159. Jabie. The student finds it rather alarming to note that SlJCh a peace- flil nation as Sweden is .buJ.l'ding up not d·efensive forces, ·but is crea- ting an armed mac.Mne capa-ble of striking an offensi:ve blow. N.o other great international pers·onal- ity than Col. Lindbergh is actively engaged in purchasing the best planes for the Swedish government. This well-balanced, sturdy little country is apparently unwilling to stand by a seethin!f Europe wjth only defensive weapons; she will soon be a-ble to strike i.f necessary. About the Spanish Revolution we can say only this: let us suspend judgment on the confused events in war-torn Spain until time, the healer of all things, can give s·ome sane, logical historian a chance to record as a complete analysis something which seems now a tPm- porary, ever-changing mirage. It is common knowledge tha.t the Third Reich is expo1·ting consider- able amounts ·of armaments to America. As a result, Ge1•many is trying, and quite successfully too, to obtain control of valuable ore c1eposiw in Brazil, Negotiations are now going on between the two gov- er.nments. This becomes more sig- nificant when one realizes that Germany depends upon outside sources for 80% of this raw ma- terial. Up to now, we haven't thought too highly of either Hawaiian mu- sic or Bing CroSlby, ·but \Sweet Leilani\ has made UlS take notice. The beginning of the record is poor, but when Crosby starts, it's pretty smooth. \Blue Hawaii\ on It happened in Salem, Mass., on Februrary 12, 1877.

After the usual pre-season warm- ups the team spent several days at Syracuse during the Sp1:ing vaca- tion where they met Syracuse Uni- vet•,;ity's stickmen in seve1·al infor- mal scrimmages and cliij!axed the short slay by defeating the 'ter- rible' Orange team, 4 to 2 in an ex- hibition game. Frosh 'l'angle Wednesday afternoon the varsity tangled with the freshmen outfit on library field-blanking the first year men while rolling up fifteen or twenty goals for themselves. Strong on the attack fo1• the Gar- nets we1e Jack Smith, Joe Paul, and Hal Vandecar. Paul was ex- ceptionally outstanding in the mid- wee!;: pt·actice. 'l'he team Harkness will put on the field tomorrow is one he has been three years in building. Com- posed largely of seniors, the squad has worked under Harkness during their college stay and have arrived at the peal;: of their ability this year. As in the past few years, Hobart will place a strong, veteran team on the field tomorrow. They have bPen playing lacrosse at H-obart fat· nearly forty years, and the boys know the game from all angles. Ferris, who will be remembered from last year, is still with the Deacons, more formidable than ever. He was a member of the All- American team which tom·ed the country after the completion of the season last year. A very dangerous man--one to be watched continu- ously. At Hobart much emphasis is placed on lacrosse playing to the exclusion of baseball and other spring sports. Much the best team that the Garnet will face, Hobart's defeat would indeed be a feather in the Dutchmen's ca}JS. Probable Lineup For the initial contest, Harkness will keep pretty much to the lineup which saw the most action in the Syracuse exhibition game. This will designate Burd at the net, Coleman at point, Lifiton at cover point. The defense will be com- posed of Reynolds, Vince Smith, and Fraset· at center. On the at- tack-All-American, Captain Jack Smith. Joe Paul, Ken MacMurray, and Hal Vandecar. Plenty of available material is on hand for reserves, who in all prob- ability will see lots of action. Burns Barford, last year's varsity goalie will be on deck; Dick Kennedy and Bill Potts and Duke Fenton are Spiked Rhoe Meeting On 'l'uesday, Apri·l 20 llt 8 P.

These three have been im- proving at a good rate, but with the advent of the season so close at hand, whether or not they wi:J be ready for a whole game is a question. The otner twirlers, include ing Jones, Stewart and Waters, are limited to horne games, a very seri- ous handicap, as both Jones and Waters can be depended upon and Stewart is gathering more control every day. Defensively, the team is good. Dave Yunich and Ed Cammoratta are both good defensive catchers, and in Ernie Brown, Union will have one of the best fil•st basemen in the small coHege circuit. Frank Myers has second practically cinched, and Harry Marra and Jake Amazon are appat·ently rele- gated to the remaining infield posts.

The brawl will be a closed affair, admission depending on a. super elaborate engraved invitatiotl issued exclusively to the staff and friends. The riot will begin promptly at 8:00 p. m. A buffet supper prepat·ed by N. W. Cease of Hale House will be served while it is still safe to leave the crockery about, and beer will be freely dispensed. A delight- ful program of entertainment has been arranged which will include speeches by the few guests who cannot be discouraged from speak- ing; community singing, murder and several skits prepared by the Concord! staff and members of the faculty. No Movie Actors Guests will include members of the editorial, business and circula- tion staffs of the Concordi, the Pub- -lications Board, Columnists, Fac- ulty members, and other frien.ds, victims and cousins of the staff. The dinner specifically will cele- brate the retirement from active service of the 1937 Concord! board, and the assumption of theh· duties by the incoming seniors. The latter will express their great apprecia- tion of their predecessors in a skit, \The Five Old Men \ or \Mac Cohen\ written by He~ry D. Hart- mann '38. A special feature of the evening's entertainment will be the opportun- ity afforded those faculty members tortured and maligned by F. H., Pete, and Uncle Willy to retaliate. F. H., however, is also reported to be hard at work on a skit designed to show faculty life on Mt. Olym- pus. He denies that thsi is being done to placate certain faculty members. ---o--- Dale Carnegie Speaks In Schenectady May 3 Dale Carnegie, author of the cur- t•ently popular new •book \How to Win Friend~ and Influence People,\ will give a lecture on the same sub- ject on Monday, May 3 in the M:ont Pleasant High School auditorium Lloyd B.

Friedrich Schon is primarily known in this country as an opera, not a concert, singer, Too often opel a singet·s become accustomed to rely on a fuH symphony orches- tla, a well laid plot, costumes, and feilow singer·s to aid them in their pt•esentation. Mr. Schorr showed his versatility as a singer by adapting himself to tne cancel t ,;tage as well as he does to the op~ra. He was ~onstantly in touch with his audi- ence which msulted in their t·e- sponse to his every mood_ His progm.m was well ch<>sen, the first three g-roups consisted chiefly of German and American lieder. Mr. Schorr docs not often sing this type of song, reserving his talents for the heavier O'peralic wm·ks of Richard Wagner. His refreshing in- terpretation of these works reflects an artistic -temperament eapa.bl'e of teglstering .a wide variety of tonal coloring. A stt·Uting example of his versatility WUB the contrast be- tween It is Ettough fl'Om Mendels- sohn's Ellajh; which Mr. Schorr sang in a ·broad style with deep religious fervor, and the lighter ·but powerful Beautiful and Rich is an Old Friendship by Waite!'

Winn.ing two meets in five sea;;ons, 'Un. i'un has by no means considered s\V itn- ming one of its popular sports. The a:ppointment of Wheatley is considered by the college a u~hor­ ities to be most fortunate. Having had considerable experience in· the sport hoth as a coach and as a swimmer himself, Wheatley- nnay revive the lagging interest iu 1he sport. When he first started the 1Jtl. ion team in 1920 he was just visiting Schenectady as an agent of. th.e M:etl'Opolitan Insura nee Company of New York City. He was at Lllat time one of the outstanding S\Vitn- nl.ers ·in the New York A. C. a1td he had just been discharged ho:rn the N'avy, in which he had served.dur- ing the war.

Some of his swimmer's held all the world's scholastic free style records in those years and wet'e na- tional interscholastic champions. During the summer of 1922 he was coach of the Duluth Boat Club swimming team. He swa~ a:; a competitor until 1927 at wh1ch t~1ne he assumed business duties, .al- though he still ren;ain~d active as an official and sw1mrnmg conslllt- ant He has lectured on swlnuning and methods of training ~nd coaching. ---~o--~ Hmith, Paul Star LPd by All-American Jack Smith and one of his t·unning mates, Jop Paul, the GarnN team ussun-:.etl an eatly lead which the visitors wrt·e una-ble to overcome as the ~arne pro-gre~ced.

Concordiensis Changes Its Staff PRICE FIVE CEWI'S Scholastic Leaders Named For ·Commencement Honors Baxter, Brownstein, Cohen, Eisenberg, Feldman, Fox, Katz, McKenzie, Reeves, Ruszkowski Have Highest Averages The ten seniors leading in scholarship in the class of 1937 for their college careers who will be honored with stage ap- pointments at the commencement exercises in June were an- nounced yesterday by Dean Charles F.

'This involves a certain amount of humility among the nations as it does among indi- viduals. \I realize that this sort of thing is far less dramatic than holding up one's hand in pledge not to fight, but only by the recognition of the value of peace and the means by which it can be pre- served in actual spil·it can civil- ized progress be a~sured. \I would rather see students pledge themselves to read such a book as Professor Shotwell's \On the Rim of the Abyss\ than I would to see them pledge against carrying a gun. The former, I think, they could keep.\ Based simply on scholastic stand- ing the ten commencement appoin- tees are, in alphabetical order, Don- ald Henry Baxter, Irving BI'Own- stein, Jerome Louis Cohen, Stuart Jerome Eisenberg, Fred Feldman, Theodore William Fox, Marvin Katz, James Wilford l\fcKenzie, jr., Charles Howell Reeves, and Casi- mir William Ruszkowski. The stage appointment is an hon- or·ary position given annually to the ten highest seniors, four of whom, including the valedictorian, will take part in the Blatchford Oratori- cals at the commencement exer- cises. This year the valedictorian will be selected by a faculty committee composed of Dean Garis, Dr. George Dwight Kellogg, Comptrol- ler Anthony deH. Hoadley, Dr. Mortimer F. Sayre and· Dr. Philip Stanley. The choice will be made from the above ten seniors on the basis of oratorical qualifications. The man chosen by the committee will :make the farewell address. The senior having the highest standing in the class, formerly called the valedic- torian, will be honored by having his name printed in the corntnence- ment program. It may be that the senior having the highest college scholarship will also be the fare- well speaker.

The Union Garnet Goblins are the authoriti~ fo1· this state!Ilent, giving an exhi· bition of American \swing\ music at Havana while on a tour that made the CUJba.ns think 11bout sometbing ehle for a change. The seven members of the troupe had always wanted to take a long trip for a change, something in- stead of their usual road engage- ments. One player managed to con- tact a shipping company in New York City that sponsored cruises to Cuba and the West Indies. The agency consented to have the Go·b- lins play on a Southern trip, but refused any salary, Then came the Union College Glee club concert at the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel in the metropolis, at which the Can\et Goblins played for dancing. The sili.pping company representatives- were present, heard the boys and agreed to pay the band a salary besides their room and board, :rnarlting the first time that particular company had ever consented to pay a college orches- .tra for playing on a cruise, They remarked that the Goblins were far superior to any college band they had yet heard and they had en· gaged several of the big ones. And as proof of their versatility, Harold Friedman, saxophone and clarinet player and featured vocal- ist of the band! Robert Crawford, saxophone, clarmet and flute play- er, AI Stauss, saxophone and clari- net player, William Dunmo1·e, t~umpet player and William Paige, ptano player, all of Schenectady, and Wallace Smith, bass player, of Amsterdam and Mel Hargreaves, drum man, of Fulton, are proudly displaying this week an offer from the same company to have the Gob- lens play a 45-day cruise to North Cape, Russia, this summer, visiting many Et!r{)pean countries en route.

'Today is th€ last time that we shall see ouT 11ames in the masthead above this column, the last time we shall answer the 'phone at -1-0133 with an all-important ail', and the last time we shall sink int(} the editor's chair at the copy desk with a comfortable and proprietary sigh. It is all rather depressing, tmd makes one feel a little sentimental. Then, we sh<>uld like to see more scholar- ships that are not bounded geographically or ethnologically, or subject to the whims of individual donors. We should like to see Union take incoming studtmts more for their promise of develop- ment than for their attainments at the date of registration. We should like to see a new gymnasium, one that is clean in appearance, even if it is in fact, and one where cr.eature C()mforts are attended to a little more assiduously. We should like to see an infirmary. We should like to see the Library returned to its original function as the mausoleum fol' Eliphalet Nott, and see the book collec- tion moved to a new building where the light. is good, the noise at a minimum, and the chairs comfortable. We should like to see a dormitory system and its concomitant, a deferred rushing sys- tem.. and. beyond that there is nC> need to say more.

Y., against the Hamil- ton squad, but scholastic ineligi- bility has deplet-ed the Union team so that it no longer can clazm enough men whG can make the trip. Despite the feverish activity of Captain Monroe F'roelich to round up a group of golfers who are in good academic s.tanding, it is more tha!ll probable that the contest with Hamilton wlll ta,Ite place tomorrow. Under the dire:ction of Coach Philip Stanley the Union golfers have been .conc<mtrating their ef- forts in the Last four or five days to smoothing out a raw outfit. The principal competitors just at preS'- ont seem to be Froelich, Fields and Ken Brown anc1 maybe Coach Stanley will be palmed off as an undergraduate. Hamilton has a formidable out- fit and even if Union came to Clin~ ton in full fo1·ce the contest would be uncertaill for either team. Neutrals Alplla PILi De!Ul. Sigma Pili Til eta.

The proceeds o:f the concert are to be used j).y th.e Schenectady County Alumni Association, which is SJponsoring th,e recital, for a scholarship for a Schenectady boy who wishes to attend Union. Gen- eral admission is to be $1.00 per person, but a special t•ate has been obtained for Union students at $1.50 per couple. When the Glee Club took their Buffalo trip Saturday morning, April 21, the:y rode OJl the Empire State Limited, which usually does not stop at Sclunectad.y. Carl Mar- shall said th.at he thought the trip was \one of the most successful of the year.'' Arriving in Buffalo they were met by rnemtbers of the Union Alumni club, who to<>k them to a dinner party a.t the hotel. At the Buffalo Athletic Club in the eve- ning, a cro-wd of 500 'listened to their concert a.nd saw their skit \Grand Oper-a Up-tOrdate.\ The Club's singing of the Echo So.ng, and Ed M:oultG>n's arrange- ment of the college songs, brought much applause from the audience. The quartet's rendition of \The Love Bug Will Get You\ and \De Lovely\ both arranged by Ed Moulton were also well received. Sunday mom.ing, the club sang as a choir in the ser'Vi(!eS of the North Presbyterian Church of which the father of Norman R. Stewar.t '37, is pastor.

Shall \Ve l'emake Union Col- lege? Shall we? We don't know. From now on we shall attempt to adhere to some intelligent program. We can only hope to fulfill our present all-inclusive ambi- tions. We do not intend to ignore the fact that circumstances may block our early in- tentions for grandiose t'eorganization. We shall try to be practical, In the broadest and least binding declar- ations we propose to be factual, widely repre- sentative, and worth reading, There is no policy that can be more difficult of achieve- ment than this one. It entails all the brain- power and physical effort that we might have to expend if we were to say that we will do great things for Union College. However, we want our audience to be crit- ical, analytical and very observing. Mute sympathy is no longer the fashion. The col- lege newspaper represents the opinions of a few immature students. The rest of the col- lege is very free to voice its or their beliefs. Comments, abusive (as we have received be- fore), constructive, and, above all, intelligent, serving the highest praise. dem· faculty, we 1 re bored with yo-u. mention imprudence, 'rhft next indicatien that Spring SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS Ab(}Ut two weeks ago a few hundred stu- dents I'epresenting an inte1:eollegiate social organization paraded around the Capitol in Washington to indicate their support of President Roosevelt's court reform. Last week several thousand co!leg:e students cut their classes at 11 o'clock to attend the an- nual nation-wide peace strike on their re- spective college campuses. There are few colleges where there is not a student movement in sympathy with the activities of socially-minded legislators. Union College is one of them. Not because some ef its students don't realize that there exist such things as sit-down strikes, peace strikes, or industrial reorganization, but be- cause they don't care to be disturbed. The administration takes no steps to pre- vent social demonstrations, despite the fact that it believes such methods ineffective. The1·e is no coercion for or against. Union College students are rest1·ained in an atmos- phere of liberalism. They have an opportun- ity to do as they wish and they don't do any- thing outside of theit· academic and social routine. The truth may be tha.t Union students have no time to take :part in demonstrations. It may be that as individuals Union students are giving intelligent appraisal to -present political and social difficulties. But it is highly improbable. Social unconsciousness seems to hold sway.

The expense connected with commencement are paid for partly by the College and partly by the Alumni Organization. The largest sing! e item of expense carried by th~ College is in cannection with the complimentary luncheon given to the alumni, graduating class, and othei' guests of the college. The second large.st item is the furnish- ing of the diplomas. In addition to these .expenses the College sends out 6500 copies of the Commencement Number of the Col- lege B•ulletln, prints appt·oxima.tely 1400 programs for the commence- ment exercises, and a number of other eJ<penses that I wiJJ not bother to detail. The total college budget covering these items will be $2250 for the next year. A simple computation will show ·this to be approximately equal to the revenue derived frorn the graduation fees.

Scott, who is known to many for h.is \Powerhouse has re- corded several of his arrangements on a new type of record, the Mas- ter. Among those that he has re- corded are \Twilight in Turkey\ and \Minuet in Jazz.\ The former is a wild and riotous mixture of un- ad-ulterated swing, with some excel- lent examples of extemporizing on a theme. We feel that the best part of the record is the work done by Johnny Williams at the drums and cymbals. Th1·oughout both these tunes he is predominan,t, setting a fast and swingy pace for the rest of the outfit. \Minuet in Jazz\ is a swing arr~ngement of a familiar old minuet. We recommend them both if you like swing. Master 108. Contrary to the usual orchestra, R-uss Morgan does not record as well as he plays on the radio, His recordings, in contrast to his radio broad~asts, al'e exceedingly poor. Out of several of his recordings, we found only one which approached \Vhat we should call a reasonably good standard. This was his re- cording of \Boo-Hoo with \If My H:eart Could Only Talk\ on the re- verse. Tllis record has some good tromboning on both sides, and both are good numbers. In the first he brings in either a harmonica or a concertina, (we think it's an har- monica), to produce a very tricky arrangem.ent.

Disputed Field Goal Causes Knotted Sc()I'e; Lafayette Easily Subdued Union's lacrosse team, well start- ed toward an undefeated season by its opening victory last week, con- tinued its winning ways last week- end as it won one and tied another. Lafayette was an easy victim on Friday by a 23-4 score, while on Saturday, Stevens put up unexpect- ed opposition and held the Dutch- men to a 5 to 5 tie, although an ex- tra point was played to break up the deadlock.

They proved that they could come from behind and pull ahead and then ke€ip their lead in spite of a ninth inning rally by Green Mountain. Trailing 4 to 2 going into the last half of the sixth, the Frosh pushed. three runs across the plate. This rally was featured by Feldman's double to right and his stealing home, knocking the Green Mountain catcher out with the force of his slide. The Frosh scored what proved to be the win- ning run in the sixth. Green Moun- tain pushed across three runs in their half of the ninth, but with men on second and third and two out, Robinson struck out the next man to end the game.

Golf After suffering a 6 to 3 drub- bing in its initial match at the hands of a strong Hamilton squad, the Union golf team journeyed to Middlebury College today for its second try this season. The contest today is a four man match. Coach Stanley has chosen Dou(l' Geer, Fre.d VanderbiLt, Ken Brown, and Captain Monty Froelich to make the trip. ·Froelich and Geer are slated for places :t and 2 in the best ball. Ken Brown led the crippled Un- ion squad at Hamilton Saturday with a score of 78, four strokes above Hamilton's best score. Brown and Captain Froelich won the two individual matches for Union. ----a--- Scientists Meet Friday's game was all Union as Jack Smith, Ken MacMurray, l!al Vandecar and Joe Paul really had a field day. This little foursome displayed some nif.ty work and scored from nearly every position as the visitors pr•oved very weak on defense. MacMurray took most of the honors in the early part of the game as he slipped in four goals in a row . .As the game pro- gressed, however, nearly every Union attackm.an tossed in a score, and with Smith leading with nine counters, the Dutchmen romped' to victory. Union's defense was brilliant at times, although Lafayette, made up chiefly of inexperienced men, had trouble in finding the range, so that at no time was the victor's lead in danger. The score was one of the largest rung up here in sev- eral years and really showed Union at its best. Stevens Strong- Saturday's game was an entirely different story. Although Union 'led at halftime by a 4-2 count, Stevens came back strong in the third and fourth periods to knot the score. Both teams put up a stubborn de- fense; both were equally strong in offensive power;. and both displayed a knowledge of the game which made the fray one of the best seen here in some time. The contest was somewhat ma.r- l'ed, however, by a disputed goal by Vandecar, which was disallowed by referee Henry. The ball apparently hit the goalie in.stead of the net, and although a wave of protest im- mediately ran through both players and the crowd, the score remained the same.

The Union College varsity track team got off to a flying start in its 1937 season Saturday when it chalked up a sweeping 95.1 to 30.1 victory over the Hamilton College Continentals on .Alexander Field. Taking first place in every event but the shot put in which Hamilton placed first and second, the Dutch- men showed complete superiority over the Buff and Blue. Three men were double victors or better last Saturday. Captain Sherman Hirst, winning the 100 and 220 yard dashes and jumping 18% feet to take third place in that event, was tied with Joe Annese who took first pLace in the half mile and mile runs and third place in the javelin. Grant Smith was the first of the timber toppers to break the tape in both the 110 yard high hurdles and 220 yard low hurdles. Union made a clean sweep of three events, tak- ing first, second, and third in the 440 yard dash, the mile, and the broad jump. Next Saturday the trackmen travel to Rochester, This is the first scheduled meet for the Dutch- men. The meet last Saturday was a pre-season meet foi' both teams. Because of this t:he times were only mediocre. The back was soggy in spots, and this slowed up the run- ners to a great extent. Bill Ketz will certainly :have his men in tip- top shape Saturday to keep intact his string of consecutive victories. Deerfield Downs Freshmen Stickmen Yearlings Lose Opening Game To Academy by Score ()f Nine to Three Inexperience and inability to co- operate on the part of the Union freshman lacrosse team made it comparatively easy for the Deer- field Academy sticltwavers to regis- ter a 9 to 3 victory on Library Field Saturday. The Union men making their official debut in this game, showed promise for future contests and several members turned in some outstanding individual per- formances. For the freshmen the work of Bill Nugent at goal was especially fine. Several times he prevented scoring with his miraculous stops. England at center accounted for two of Union's tallies, Hutchins scoring the other. Stillman at sec- ond defense for Union played a scrappy game. Late In the first half things looked good for the freshmen with the score tied at two all. Deerfield went to town in the remaining half however with Crolius and Chivers setting the pace in scoring. The frooh will not see action again until May 13 when they meet the Gow School team from South Wales, New York, at Union.

It is one of the best planned cities evet· and has the enviable reputation of being- the cleanest capital in Europe. Copen- hagen is not only a metropolis of historical interest with its castles and museums, but it offers perhaps as much as any city on the contin- ent in the way of amusement. There is the unrivalled Trivoli, in· numerable parks, theatres and clubs, and of course the Carlsberg domain. \This last spot is one that should not .be missed by the sightseer. The Carlsbergers proudly display amongst the famous signature in their guest book those of Lind- bergh and the Duke of Windsor. The factory is the largest of its kind in Europe and i:; undoubtPdly the most hospitable of its kind in the world. At the end uf a tour through the colossal wor·ks Carls- berg offers each visitor at least eight varieties of mastpt· pt·odure. The biggest difficulty the guides have with theit· visitors is g-Hting rid of them. Many tourists who have planned on an hour or two trip through the factur·y wh<'n con· fronted with the farewell a nay have turned it into a ten hour cPIP· bration. And it's all on Carl\berg. \Oslo at Easter irnpre8sed one as being a ghost town. Ev•·ryone was up in the mountain\ okiing.

Grainger is not a techni@lly per- fect pianist, he has a good g.rasp of this particular .cornpositi<m. While perhaps overemphasizing Its more folklike themes he played it with power and feeling. The <>rchestral accoiiLJlaniment was surprisingly well executed with the ex:.ception of the closing strain, where the com- poser intended the main theme to stand ou.t, carried by dou.ble fortis- simo brasses. This melody, not suf- ficiently emphasized, was lost in the rather heavy accompani.ment of the strings. Mr. Grainger disapp<>inted us very much by following this mas- terpiece with his trivial,. monoton- ous, and hackneyed Cot:llltry Gar- dens.

Tennis Team Meets Colgate Saturday Coul'tmen Look F(H' Victory Over Maroon In First Of Two Matches Rained out In its matches with Syracuse and Williams earlier this week, the varsity tenn.is team !is slated to eng:age Colgate at Ham· ilton tomorra.w in its third actual match <>f the season.

With two men again on the side- lines f-or scholastic reasons, the team must necessarily be the same which played the C>pening matches. Marvin Dwore and Fritz Hawley, the two ranking players, will again assume the :number one and two positions, and will again team up in the doubles. Neither of these m,;m has bee:n beaten as y·ef, and their doubles combinatiC>n has dropped but on,e set. Doc Orton, diminutive captain, will be number three, while Bernie Salad, who last week: lost- his; first matches in two years; wlli be the: fourth si.ngles man.
