Sunday afternoon the members of the muslcal cluhs returned from Buffalo by a private car after a series of three au·ccessful concerts. The clubs left on Ttursday in a private ·car attac;hed to the 10:10 Delaware and Hudson train to Binghamton. Arriving there early in the afternoon they were entertained by the Binghamton High school Chap· ter of the Theta Sigma sorority. In the evening a concert was given before a large audience at the Monday Afternoon Club. Proceeding to Elmira on the fo Bowing after- noon, the mem·bers of the clubs were entertained by the Union Alumni in Elmira, and u:p.der tl:..eir auspices a concert was given in FederaJion Hall in the evening. The next morning ;'tile car left 'X'..,,. for Buffalo at 9:21, arriving there at 1:05. The ~Glee Club. 2. \Yankee Dandy'' Banjo' Club. 3.

He also hopes to arrange for a \down-the'\river\ trip early in the spring. The musical clubs are the beat which 'nave re- presented the college in many years, and th.e con- certs given were of a high order. The glee club gave a little playlet to open the pr{}gra:n, and later a \rube\ vaudeville sketch. The other clubs aJs.o had some laughable \stunts'' to introduce.

The time was 36 3-5 seeonds. Case Breaks High Ju:mp R·ecord. In the D.igh jump Case, '12, suoceeded in cross- ing the bar a.t 5 ft. 9 inche~, thus breaking the present college record which he holds. Although L.e jumped two in0hes higher than any of the ot:1er contestants, he receivd only se·cond place o.s he was jumping from scratch. Lee, '1 0, from the law department tied for third place in the high jump, and Daly won second place in his heat in the 150 yard dash, hand:·cap. Streibert, '09, ran in a relay team with ihe Albany City Y. M. C. A. which won second piace. ln the General 'Electric Com•pany relay team w:i:lich took first place in the ~ercantile relay, Streibert, '09, and Dwyer, '08, both ran. Several good college relays were run off, Syra- cuse defeating Wesleyan, Pratt InstLnte defeat- ing the Amherst \Aggies Will~ams winning over Drown and Cornell defeating Columbia. The Syracuse team ran the mile in 3 minutes and 2G 2-5 seconds, establishing a. new record for the Troy track. GAME WITH CORNELL. Union, 8; Cornell. 36 . On Washington's birthday the Garnet five were badly defeated at Ithaca by the Cornell tARin. The Cornell team showed a great deal of .3nap and speed from the very start and the scor0 \vas in their favor throughout the whole game. The Cornell guards kept close guard over the Union forwards and were careful not to give them easy throws at the basket, while the Union players could not keep the opposing center and forwards in cD.eck. Coward was unable to make the trip owing to the pressure of college work and was greatly .missed throughout the game. Smith· who played at -center in place of Anderson failed to keen his man -carefully covered and a large num- ber of points were scored against hin1. The line-up of the Union team was: Center, Smith; forwards, Johnson and Hequemhourg; guards, Captain Charest and Fairbairn. Tlhe Une-up was the same in both halves no substitutions being ntad.e. GBiiDI RON FUN. The game wa.s ended, and t~e noise, at last had died away, and now they gathered up the boys where they in pieces lay. And one was 'hamn1ered in the ground by many a jo[t and jar; some fragments never have been found, bhey flew away so far. They found a stack of tawny hair; some fourteeH cubils high; it was the half- back, lyin.g there, where he had crawied to die. Ttey placed the pieces on a door, and from the crimson field, that hero then t 1 hey g·ently bore, like soldier on his shield. The surgeon toiled the live long night above the gory wreck; he got the ribs adjusted right, the wish bone and the neck. He soldered on the ears and toes, and got the spine in place, and fixed a gutta-percha nose upon the mangled face. And then he wash- ed his hands and said: \I':n glad that task is done!\ The half- back raised his fractured head, and cried: \I call this fun!\ -Ex. MEETING O·F THE F.INANCE COMMITTEE. President Richmond was in New Yorl{ last Fri- day attending a mee ~ing of the finance committee of the board of trustees. The members of the comLnittee are Oharles E. Sprague of New York, ·Hon. George F. Seward of New York, 1-Ion. Silas B. Brownell of :~ew York, Edwin W. Rice, Jr., of Schenectady, and Hon. Alonzo P. Slroug of Sche- nectady. Althoug·:il it was impossible to obtain a rP.port of the meeting, it is expected that action was taken concerning the rebuilding ef the part of South College which was destroyed by fire. Bnoug:t money will probably be granted the Press Club to enable it to maintain a room of its own in which to ho·ld meetings and transact other~ business. From New York President Richmond went to Mercer.sburg, Pa., where he delivered a sermon before the students of Mercersburg Academy on Sunday. Some of the fraternities and societies at Illinois ·have a ''Jubilee\ night after the mid-year ex- aminations.

CHAP.EL It wou~d ·certainly seem that it C.ONDUC:T. should be entireiy unnecessary to say anything to Union men about remissness in ·chapel conduct, for an attitude of proper respect in any service of worship is uni versally ·considered one of the marks of a .gentle· rnan, and lack of it an unmistakable sign of an uncultured or ill-mannered man. Yet we have noticed with deep regret tiha t the attitude of a part of the s~udent body-a small part, let us l1ope-during the chapel service is, to say t1.~ least, decidedly unbecoming and ungentlemanly . Sueil conduct as this the true kind of coUege spirit will not tolerate. Bome of the 'fellows habitually engage in loud whispedng and subd11ed laughter during ~he entire aervice. Now s-uch conduct as this is childish. lVIen who have ad- vanced far enough in life to be students at ·col- lege surely ought not to need to be reminded of what common decency and ordinary gentle.ma.n- 1iness require. During the last few days this dis- orderly conduct has been ao pronounced as not only to disturb the whole student body, but even to noticeably irritate the President 1nd the Dean. Nor is this rude ·conduct ·Confined to under-class- men alone. It is lamenta.ble to note that even some Sen· ors, who surely have been in college l.on:g enough to know bet~er, are not entirely free from censure in this matter. Student sentiment does not favor such con- duct, and any real gentleman should have enough senBe to preserve a proper behavior in c·hapel. At least if he does not care to at end to th1 service hi::.nself, he will not hinder others fro:rn dco ing so. Those who do not care to preserve gentlem.anly conduct in chapel out of reverence, should at least do it for the sake of ·commont decency and out of regard for the Dean and Prexy. let us re- member, too, t'hat it is a man's conduct in these little matters that make him a gentle.:nan or otherwise; and further, that the attitude of the student .boody in such things as these help to make or mar its reputation for genuine college spirit. We honestly believe that only a very few men are responsible for cau.sing the need of such an ed~torial as t1his. But \if the cap fits, wear it.''

''!''HE CONCOR·DIENS,IS Last week for t1le irst time $2,500 P:L;'E .. D.GED FOB BEAUTI•FYING CAMPUS. . -· At a recent meeting at Pr-esident Richmond's ~ ., \ to ' ~ house of the business :men interested i:n the .pro· AS•SOC.L~ 1' 1 1•0 N. since its existence at Union Col- lege, the Musical Association took its members on an extended trip, giving a seriea of concerts in Binghamton, Elmira and Buf- falo. For several years ·concerts havre been given in Sehene.ctady and nearby eities until the musi·cal clubs have finally established a. reputa- tion which enables them to arrange concerts in those cities wh~ch they choose to incl'ude in their ·tripa. Great credit should be given by the stu- dents to the efficient management wr.~.ich has placed the musical association on .a firmer basis this year than ever .before. Membership in one of the mus:eal clubs is now ·considered a college honor worth striving for, and .so great is the in- terest s·ho-wn by .the members of the glee club that some time ago they volun~arily instituted a system of fines for absences at re 1 hearsals. ject of rai·sing $25,000 for beautifying the college campus, it was .announced that three men, whose names nave not as· yet been. made public, have contributed $2,50:0 with whic:h to start the fund. The buainess men of the ·city_ believe that the college which has for ove-r a hundred years fur~ nished opportunities for higher education at small cost to the young men of Schenectady., and ·has sent out her sons to beeome leaders in the phil· anthropic life of the community, deserves the hearty co-operatiop. of the reaidents of Schenec- tady. They also realize that any undertaking to increa:se the re_puta~ion of the college is a good advertisement for the city in general. The value of a musical association with a good reputation can hardly be over-estimated. In all the cit~es in which successful concerts are given a new interest is awakened in the colle-ge, and the name of Union becomes more favorably known throughout the country. Of all the m.ean.s which are now being used to advertise our .college and bring it into the consideration of ·nigh school students who are soon intend~ng to enter college, the musical association may soon become one of ~he most efficient. It should receive the loyal supp,ort not only of those who have musical ability but of the whole student body as well. THE CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. At the vesper service Sunday afternoon Roger Williama of Bridgeport, Conn., gave the fellows an interesting .talk on the problems with whict: a business roan .has to ·contend. Mr. Williams is the head of. the Crane Valv·e Com·pany, one of the large ;nanufacturing concerns of New England, and has bad a wide business experience. He was one of the apeakers before the industrial con· ference at Northfield last summer. At the vesper service a week from Sunday Rev. Ed ward W. Miller, Union, '87, of Alb-any gave a talk on the \Main Divisions of the Ohrist- ian Chu rc·l1, and the Reasons for Them.\ Mr. Miller w·as formerly a professor of- Church His- tory at the Auburn Theological Seminary. It is planned .to pla·ce an ornamental iron fence along the Union Street side of the ,college grounds. The drive ways are to be improved, many of the old eln1s are to receive treatment, and the appearance of the grounds will be better· ed in other ways. The committee which has charge of raising the lnOney i.s co1nposed of E. W. Rice, Joseph vV. Smitley, W. L. R. Emmett, W. T. Hanson and Dr. \V. L. Pearson. This is the se·cond meeting which has been held in connection with the business men's movement, the first meeting being held several weeks ago. D•R. CADY'·S LAST LE·CTURE. Interesting Facts About Jerusa1em. Dr. Putnam Cady of Amsterdam gave his last lecture in the winter series on his archaeological explorations in the Orient ·Friday afternoon. The lantern slides were unusually interesting, pictur .. ing vividly the scenes of many of the events con· nected with: Christ's life such as the Garden of Gethsemene, the Mount of ·Olives and the sup- posed spot of tile crucifixion. In spea.king of the Jewis·h people he paid a high tri.bute to the race for their character and wha ~ they had aceompliahed in history. There were many beautiful slides .of the Mosque of Omar which is conceded by all .arc·haeologists to be the finest pie-ce of arc:hitecture in the Arabian world, but which is 11ow being aUowed to be- come seriously impaired because of lack of ·care. .

The Pratt five· we-re P·laying in very good luck to carry off the victory. E.sp•eeially in the first half was their ~g.ood fortune apparent, when they shot baskets fr.om aN parts of the court. In .the second half· Pr.at-t w1as unable to make a basket, their two points being made on f.oul thro·ws. 'J;he ·crowd ·wa.s. the largest o.f the season, the Pratt supporters being very nu.rner.ous. The root- ers f.or the visitons .occupied a sectio-n of the bleach- ers and made a good deal ·Of noise. The game started at 8: 15. Fior some time p.;eUher side scored. Then Fa.irbair'n shot a basket from the si:de Qf the ·court. Pratt tied the score - by s-ecur'ing a free thro·w. Each side seored on .f•ouls. Then Pratt took the le.ad and retained i.t the rest of the ~arne. By long s•hots, in whiclh I uck largely figured, Pratt secured several haskets. On close, ea:sy throw,s· each tea·m sho·wed a w,eak- ness, many fine c·hances bringing· no results. Union was never far be•hind, ·and the play occu- pied the wh·ole cour.t. With each team pl>ay,ing hard, the half ended, t 1 he S'C'Ore being 21 to 13, in Pra·tt's favor. - In the·s-e·cGnd ·h·a1f each team p.resente·d the sa·me line--up as bef.ore. Union came· back very strong, as ·htas be·e;n their habit this year, and in the first minute of the play Goward secured a basket, which Hequembourg qui-ckly d up.Ji.cated. Thereaf.ter there was Httle s·coring, Pi'att securing tw•o points on fouls, wthile Union m.aJde three m-ore in the same way. About the middl·e of {he half Brumm re- p.Ja.ced Chtarest, and, -in the last minute of the play, S·mith was sent in for Anders·o·n. Union made six b.aske·ts, whic.h, w'it:h eight su·ccessful foul ·throws, gave them twenty points. Pratt had m.ade nine field throw1s, whi·ch, wHJh five fouls, netted them twenty..:three points.

PROF. KINNICUTT SPEAK•S IN CHAPEL. Method of Sewag•e Disposal Discussed. Last week Friday night in the college chapel Prof. L. P. Kinnicutt of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute gave an interesting illustrated lecture on \The Most Modern Methods of Sewage Dis- posal.\ The lecture, which wa~ giv-en under the auspices of the Eastern New York section of the American Chen1ical Society, was well aaended, the chapel being filled by students, members of the society and others interested in the subject. The first speaker whom Dr. ·Ellery, fhe president of the society introduced, was Mayor Duryee, who talked on the importance of the problem to the c~ty of Schenectady, and showed the danger to the public health in using the lVIohawk River as a 1neans of disposing the city's sewage. Prof. Kinnicua then took up the different rnethods of sewage disposal, first considering the old plan of carrying the sewage o·ut into the ocean;: second, the filtration bed; thi.rd, th-e so- called septic tank; and fourth, the plan of th.c percolating filter. He ·consid-ered the last plan one of the best and cheapest. \Went to see a football game, Thought that I could play the same, So, in 'haste I joined the eleven- I am writing this from Heaven.''

THE CoNcoRDIENSIS VOL, XXXIII UNION COLLEGE, MARCH 9, 1910 No. 2'0 TBIANGULAR DEBATE. Union Loses to 'Colgat-e and ·Defeats Hamilton. On Friday evening, March fourth, we·re held the first annual d€bates of the Triangular Intercol- legiate Debating L~eague, of which Colgate, Rant- ilion and Union are the members. The visiting i.eallls supported the affirmative, and the bome teams the negative of the question, \Resolved that a graduated income tax should be .a part of our Federal system of taxation.\ The three de· bates resulted in a draw, each college winning and los:ng one debate. The Union team again.st Hamilton was composed of Cohen, '11; Potter, '10; S. Cavert, '10; with Coplon, '10, as alternate. The presidents of the three colleges presided ~t the respective de·bates. At Union the chapel was well filled, the students turning ·out in large number's. The debate wae very spirited, the cross-fire of rebuttal being par- ticularly hot. The Hamilton men advocated the inco~ne tax for reasons of revenue, justice, patriot- ism, and elasticity. The Union men pro-posed a Pederal eorporat:on tax as more just than t11e income tax. Cavert, '10, was especially brilliant in his rebuttal spee-ch. Senator Agnew, as c:1air~ rnan of the board of judges, awarded Union the decision. Prof. MeKean deserve·s great credit for the excellent showing m.ade by the teams, and a bright future for the Union debating teams is a3- sured. The debate be·tween Colg-ate and Un'!.on was .held in the Sheldon Opera House at Hamilton on the evening of March fourth. President E. B. Bryan pre,sided at the contest. The opera house was filled to its capaci~y with a very attentive audience consisting of a large number of college men and townsp-eople. The question: \Resolved that a graduated income tax should be a part of our 'B.,ederal system of taxation.\ Union upheld the aff~rmative side of the que~· tion. The speakers were Theodore W. Hannigan, '13; .James H. Potter, 12; Roland M. Bartlett, '10; Williarr1 L. C~vert, '10, alternate. ~Colgate detent\· ed the negative and was represented by Willia;n Willard Bartlett, '10; Lewis C . .Sorrell, '11; David Levy, '10;· Robert A. Rundle, '10, alternate. The judges for the· debate, who had been select· ed by Hamilton .College, were William R. Loomis, Xorwich; James Moore, '0netda; Augustus H. Shearer, Ph. D., Hamllton College. Mr. Hannigan of Union, .opened the debate for the affirmative. He devoted his time to a con sideration of the inequities of the present situa- . tion in th~s country, especially those resu1ting fr-om cus~oms duties and the existing taxes on real estate and personal property. Mr. Rartlott, who was the first to defend the negative, aTgued that an income tax can be desired for only three reasons, first for revenue; second for elasticity; third for justice. Then he proceeded to show that from none of these standpoints is there any need of an income tax. Mr. Potter continued the debate for Un~on. Ile dis.cussed the ethi-cal relation of the income tax to the existing situation in the U11ited States, ~lJ.owing first of all that such a tax would remedy present injusti-ces. He then went on to prove i'h at an incorne tax should be a graduated tax and that it r'·1Guld also be a Federal tax, showing that such a tax accords well with our national tenden- cies. Mr. S-orrell, in continuing the arguments of the negative, maintained that, if there were a Y'ee·d. for greater justice, the income tax would not supply this need, as it is i-mpracticable. Mr. Bartlett~ in closing the direct argu.:.nent for the .affirmative, ·Contended that in the light of bb~.ll'\- there is no serious objection to the prac- ticabiHty of graduated income tax. He ::tlso pre- sented three elements which might be employed in asses . .sing an income tax, declaration by the tax payer, official review of declarations, and in· vestig.ation at the source of income. Mr. Levy concluded the argument for the negative. It was his position that, granted there is a need of gre-at- er justice in taxation and that the income tax is pra-cticable, ther,. ir ,a, ~better re~edy for existing evils, namely, a Federal inheritance tax. This -~-.::· \ , ~ ...

6 was a very strong element in the posaion of the negative. The most interesting :part of the eon t;~st beg~n with the opening .of the rebuttal. Both s:ides d&d excellent work. Sorrell was very effeetive in arguing that an income tax is inpraeticabre,. while on the affirmative side ·both H.a.nnigan a:nd Potter presented able arguments in. maintaining that there is a great need for an income tax an:d that it .should be both graduated ani 1 FederiJ Mr. Levy clinched the .argument for the negativ€ and strengthened his position regarding an ~n­ heritance tax. Bartlett closed the debate slil.ow· ing, among other things, that the negative had failed to attack the system of assessment ad vanc- ed by the affirmative. ·The judges were out thirty minutes and at length decided that the weight of arghlment wad with the negative. ----------· ORGANIZATION O·F TROY ALUMNI ASSIOIC.IATION. Last Monday night a. most enthaaiastic body of TRACK. On last Monday afternoon. the 'Varsity tra·ck team met defeat at t:he hands or the team repre- senting the Massachusetts Agricultural Gollege at North Amherst, by a score of 17 to 42. The Union team, in the first place, was handicapped by not being farp.iliar with th,e track, {which is t!l.le B. A. A. s:andard) .and in the second place, by having to run on a board track with spikes. Union did not show up very well in the eventt which occurred on this track with tt.e e:Kception of the relay race. In this event the Arnherst team covered the d;s~ance in 3 :::uinutes and 15 seconds, which is ·within seven seconds of the world's record. The Union relay team finished about seventy yards behind that of the Massachu- setts college. In the under events, ·i. e.; shot put, high jump and 30-yard dash, Unton secured two places in every event. 1,000 yards___JBarrow.s, M. A. C., first; Cowles, M. A.

Publication Office, Sc-henectady Evening Star. THE Y. M'. C. A. From the 7th to the lOth of CON:F ERENCE. April the annuai conference of Y. M. C. A. ·presidents from the eoUeges and universities of the East is to be held .b.erH at the invitation of our College As- sociation. The f.act that such ~a gathering is to meet at Union ought to be a m~atter of no small concern not only to the Y. M. C. A. but also to every lnan in college. That such a conference will mean very much to our Y. M. C. A., it is need- less to say. It may not be so evident, but a few moments' re.fiecEon will surely make it clear, that the benefit to the ·college will be fully as great or even greater, for there will be here picked men from the college world. The number of delegates will not he large but it is seldom, in- deed, that a more truly representative crowd would come together here. It may be many years oefore men fro1n the big universities such as Princeton, Harvard, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, to say noth~ng of colleges like Dart- mouth, Williams, Bowdoin and Amherst, ~will ever see Union again. Fro;n most of the smaller in- stitutions there will be ·only one or two delegates,. but the large universities will have addit~onal re- presentatives. There will ,certainly be some oppor~unity dur- ing these three days for every man in college to do something to make the visit of our guBsts more pleasant and to deepen their impress:on of the genuine worth of our college, the intense loy,alty of our men, our thoughtful cour~esy of vis:ltors: from other colleges, and the sincerity and depth of our college spirit. Shall we not all take this opportunity of showing these representative col- lege men tha,t Union, though not as large or as wealthy as many, is :n the front rank in those qualitis that constitute real greatness in a col- lege? AB,SE\NIC,E FROM COLLEGE .MEETING. Last Monday morning after the Faculty had passed out of chapel and the student body had risen to sing Alma Mater,. a most noticeable and unpardona,ble ineiden t occur- red-a bout twenty-five fellows filed one by one out of the ba~ck door. Now doubtless sevent1 of them had excellent reasons for \bolting\ eollege meeting and for them, therefore, this editorial can mean nothing. But to t'he others it may be .said

that such a proceeding w·as shameful an!l abso- lutely unpardonable. That a Union man should willfully .absent himself from any college meeting which is alway.s held for the best interests of his Alma Mater is incomprehensible. It is fHr- ther ·suggested that even ~hose vvho hav-e perfect- ly plausible excuses to l~.ave early shall stay at. least until tne singing o.f Alma Mater is com,pleted and then only for an excellent reason leave. Thus we -can ho-pe to raise our college spirit to an e.ven ·higher plane. CO,LLEGE MEETING. The college m.eeting on Monday opened with the singing of Alma Mater. \iValser, '10, nmde a :;:notion to the effe.ct that a letter of thanks be sent from the student body to Mr. Locke of Buf- falo, thanking him for his kind entertainment of the Musical Clubs when in that city. The motion was seoonde(l .a.nd carried. Bartlett, '1 0, spoke for the debating team that went to Colgate, and especially praised Potter, '12, and Hanigan, '13, for their work there. He expressed his gratifica- tion at the treatment reee~ved there,. and spoke very higb.ly of the· debate. Prof. McKean next called the attention of the students to several phases of the Triangular Debate and its results, stating that bott Hamilton and ·Colgate drew up their strongest tean1s, respectivel:v, ag.ains: Union. Ferguson, '10, for the ~athletic board, read the basketball awards. Faust, '11, made a Glee Club announcement. .Stewart, '11, announced that baseball pra:c~ice would be held regularly in the \gym\ on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. President Cavert, giv~ng the chair to Hutchens, then told the fellows of the convBntion of College Y. M. C. A. Presidents wb.ict is to he held here, and asked for everyone's support in making the gathering a successful one. He also anno·unced that the .annual Y. ~'.I. C. A. elecJon wou1d be h~1d on Tuesday, March 14. The meeting then· ~d- journed. B;ASKETS.A:LL A WARD'S. At the meeting of the awards con1mittBe neld .~1 uday, I~ebruary 28, the following· a W8 rds were nta<le for the basketball season: U-Charest, Anderson, Johnston, Coward, Fair· bairn, Hequembourg. a A a-Shutler, Brum, Sn1ith. THE ROCHE.STE'R UN.ION GAME. Before a 1arge au-dience the Garnet five were bea;:en on February 26. The game waq f.<Jught t~ll the end with true Union .spirit, but Rochester was too fast for our team. Union did mucb bet- ter at guarding th.an at pass-work, but in spit€ of Lil.is were defeated. The game s ~arted with a rush and for several n1inutes there was no scoring on either side. Then~ Woodman's .se·ored one point from the foul line and a n1.oment later Coward was giv·en a '- chance for a free throw and scored. Rocb~ster made several points by the clever work of Woorl~ n1an who threw six fouls dur~ng the first pe rior1 of pl.ay. Not until just before the close of t1.te first 'half was Roehester able to .score fron1 t_hc:> field. Then :in rapid order ·Cox and H. Ed-w~rds eaeh caged the ball for tw·o poinr.s. During the second half Harmon replaced Cox, and Bloss went in c€nter for W. Edwards. Later Ramaker replaced Bloss and it was due to the clever ·work of Harmon and Ramaker that R{)eheR· ter was able,. by a Beries of neat field g·oals, to raise the final score to 25. For Rochester, Harmon, Ramaker and Cox: were exceptionally s~rong, while for Union the r!onors were ahout €qually divided. Line up of the teams was as -rollows: Rochester.

lU THE UONUOl{D\~NSIS CAST ·OF THE ID 1 0L. W'EE·KLY ·GA'L·ENDAR. For many years the Idol has be·e:n. one of the March 11- cEstiiJ.Ctive features about Union .CoUeg.e. E~m- 1'2: 30~Glee Club rehearsal. blems of it have been used so often that it has becon1e well known throughout the country. It is distinctive, both because of the historic interest cone.cted wit~1 it and also becal!lse .of ·use to whi·ch it is put at present and because of the interest that is taken :n it during the greater })art of every college year. Because of the fact that the Idol holds ;;uch :1 prominent place in our college life an atten1pt has been n1ade to produce a Ukeness of it, such that every student may be able to have and to keep as a reminder of his colle.ge days. A cast of the Idol has been made and the rep1·oduction of the im·age is almost exa.ct. The ca.st is eight inches high with the base proportionate to the height of the Idol proper. nn the bottom of t:1e cast is the following short deseription of the Idoi___. ''The Union College Idol.\ \This figure is a reproducti·on of a Chinese Idol situated in the rear of Washburn Hall on the Unlon ·College grounds. \It was presented to the~ coli ege in 187 4 by Dr. J. L. ~evins, '48, a distinguished missionary to c:1ina. For some years it was left unmolested by the studen~s but one m·orning the officers of the college were surprised to find it covere·d with a coat of white paint. Then it became the center of the struggle for underclass supremacy and is still a silent witness to many a hard-fought con- test.\ This description gives an idea of what the Idol is. The cast is something w\hich will serve as a de~coration for the .student's room or as an appropriate gift to any one interested in the col- lege. It was produced by a firm in Bosi·on and ~s prote~cted by a copyri-ght from any duplication. A limited num·ber of .casts hove been ordered but if the sale ,of them is large enoug·h more will be ordered at any time. The price, which is one dollar, is low enough to allow every one to obtain one of tbe casts. They may be ordered of T. G. Dunn, '11, who will .supply any further informa- tion desired.

Angle, Allan H. Jackson, Schenectady, N. Y. Gentlemen:- Your order of February 21, 1910, authorizing me as treasurer of the committee instrumental il~ raising the fund for an 8thletic field, to turn over the an1ount received to the trustees of thP College in aid of the gymnasium fund as that is also to bring about an athletic field, is received. It may be O·f interest to you gentlemen to know how t11at account stands. Tbe fin:;t deposit was xnade December 12, 1896, of $5.00, and the last d-eposit was made May 28, 1898, of $3.00. Be- tween these dates from erne to tin'le as the moneys came in they were deposited, and the total amount r-e.ce<ived by us and put in that fund was the sum of $631.30. It was deposited in the S·chenectady Savings Bank and a Pass Book No. 23032 taken iu its name. Interest has accrnnn- lated from time to time, am-ounting now to $341.7fi, so that on the first day of .January, 1910, the totti 1 am·ount to the credit of the fund was $973.05. A state·ment of thiR will be sent to Dr. Rich- mond, as requested by you, with the suggestion that it remain as it is, intact, until necessary for its use in cone·ction with the other funds raised. If this n1eets y·our approbation, I suggest that you inform me of that fact. The matter was discussed fro1n all view-points. Stude lst.-Yes, tliat is an old saw that ha~ been handed down from generation to genera· tion. Stude 2nd.-A kind of hand-saw, n'est-ce pas?

THE VOL. XXXIII UNION COLLE·GE~ MARCH 16, 1910 No. 21 . .. C..;...; YORK STATE lNI'ER .. COLLEGIAT·E ATHLETIC!S. At the meeting of the New York State Inte:r- ·collegiate Athletic Oouncil in Utica on March .5, Grover r·eprese.nted the student body, Mr. King o11r alumni and Dr. McOom ber the fa.culty. The 1909 baseball pennant •whic.il had been dis- cussed in previous meetings, was awarded to Rochester. The ineligibility ·claims of Colgate against Harrington of Rochester, and those of Union against Buck of Colgate W8re not adn1it.ted by the judiciary com~~ttee. The football pennant for the season of 1909 was not awarded. Colgate and Rochester were qualified for lt, but Colgate did not have a com- plete schedule in the league, and as Roc:1ester was defeated by Colgate they did not wish to tal\:e it. Rochester was awarded th.e bn,sketball penant for 1910. The annual inter-.col.legiate track meet wil! be beld Decoration Day, May 30, on the fEI.ir grounds at Rome, N. Y. Better financial arrangements ,;~.,-ere offered by the Rome than by the Ut' ca n1anagement. The traek at Rome is one of the best in that part of the state and m.et with the approval of the entire counciL Invitat1ons will be sent to New York Univer8ity, Pratt Institute, St. Lawrence University and th.e University of Vermont. It was dec~ded that men in the Albany de- partments of Union University muRt. have bef\n in their respective department one year before they can take part in the Association contests. The reason for this ruling was that men colX'e from other colleges to the Albany de·partn1ent and immediately play on our teams. PLANS FOR \INTERSCHOLASTIC DAY. Plans are being eomp lBted to make the sub- freshmen day on May 14 the most successful event of the kind that has ever been held at Union. Invitations have already lbeen sent to every ac1lool that has ever sent a: man here to .college, and the number of participants in the inters·cholastic ) track 'lneet will undottbtedly exceed that of any previou.s year. The first event of the day wi11 be the ''M·oving Up\ €xercises, after which th.e Freshn1en and Sop hoiDores will unite 'in painting t:he \Idol\ which is a. syn1:bol that all under class rivalry is at an end for the year. At 9: 30 o'clock, a tennis match will be held on the fraternity courts be- tween ·union and Am.lierst. :The track meet ·will be begun in the morning and will last until the middl-e of the afternoon. Immediately after the track meet, Un~on is to meet Hobart in baseball, and in the evening there ~i11 be held a rousing Campus meetiniP and a reception by the Christian Association in Sillhnan Hall. Something o:E in· t.erest w~ll be taking place throughout the whole day, and it will be a gala day not only for the college, but, also, for many of .the city people who are interested in Union's welfare. Th€ committees who are to have charge of the different events of the day t.ave been appointed as follows: Reception_ Committee for Visitors--T. D. Wals-er, S. M. Caver-t and A. E. Kriegs1nann. Re·ceptinn Committee for Visiting Teams___.Prof. U. F. Garis, H. H. ·Grover. Entertainment CoiRmittee-A. C. Potter and 0. A. ~aust. Committee for Campus Meeting-A, C. Potter ·and 0. A. Faust.

' ' THE MUSIC·A'L CLU8 1 S' TR<IP. rrhe following is a clipping from one {)f tlre Buffalo papers ·of ·February 27, in regard to the concert given in that eity by our Musical c~uli>s a short time ago. It certainly spealts well for this ,·ear's organization: Union Co:Hege Men Are· F'ine Musicians. An audience of about 3·00 did not f.onn the only visitor at the concert of the un~_on College Musi- cal Clubs in Seminary Hall, on the corner of Bidwell Parkway and Potomac Avenue, yester- day evening. 1\!fary and her little Iamb were an interested and interesting section of the amuse· .nent. Mary entered into the festivities dur-ing th first encOr8 to \If Yol!l Want to Go to Un~on,.'' and the young lady together with her wooly com· panion were said to lbe gallivantinl?; in the light of the f:liekering moon. Mary's lamb was a little Iamb, sure enough-abol!lt two inches high__,nut Mary was large enough to make np for the differ- ence. In fact, her a;ppearance was decidedly masculine. The ·concert was not only a good one from a n1usical standpo!nt, but it had a number of unique talk that rippled ·with humor of the kind which 111eased the college me.n· immensely, and they ex:presS'ed appreciation of his efforts by frequent and prolan ged applause. Y. M. 'C. A. ·OFFICERS ELE~CTED. T'he annual eleetion of officers of the Christian Association for the coming year was held in Silli- man ·Hail on Tuesday evening. The officers ·who were elected, 0. A. Faust, president; J. H. Potter, vi-ce president.;. \E. H. Branson, treasurer; and E. P. ~Grafft, .secretary, are all men who have showed an interest in the Y. M. C. A. dur lug the past year. The nominating c-ommittee, S. M. Gaver:t, T. D. Walser and E. 'B. Irish, chose the candidates after a great deal of thought, and it is e:xpected tha'i:. tile Y. M. C. A. will be efficiently managed next year. At the vesper service last Sunday, Dr. H. W. Darling, treasurer of the General Electr· c Com· pany, gave .the f~Hows an interesting talk that especially a,ppealed to those who are intending to follow a business life. Owing to the examinations Lhere will be :no s·~rvice next Sunda.y. The Tues- aspects which were a w6lcome relief from the d :ty evening T~leetings will be cont'nued :::gain ha·ckneyed tyr:e of glee club concerts, which were during the Spring term.

The rest soon caught the infection and a song was in full swing. From that time on something new was happen ing in nearly every number. All three of the clubs had excellent musicians. A large party of college men attended a ban· quet for the clulbs, which was held in the ban- quet hall of the University Club last night. The feature of the banquet was a humorous address by John D.

'THE UONOOltDlENSlS 7 c.OLLEGE MEETING MAHCH 14, 1910. The :meeting was opened by the singing of Alma Mater. This was foll<!rwed by the medley and then the meeting was ·called to order by Presiden. t .ca vert. A .. G. Potter said a few words to the students ·concerning the editorial in the ·Conoordiensis, and emphasized the fact that if any felLows· must bolt c-ollege meeting they should remain until Allna Mater had been sung. ,He urged the fellows to spe:ak to those who had gone out a.:nd persuade them to wait hereafter. Hutchins lead a long cheer for the tra-ck team. Denni-s responded by telling the fello-ws he felt guilty in speaking .of the track meet at A:~.uherst. He said the result was not what had been hoped for, but claim·ed that the Union runners were not accustomed to the s~quare ·cornered !board track and S·O were at a great disadvantage. Dennis beEeves we may hope for better success when we have better facilities for running he,re at the college. H·owever, he did not regard Union' .s de- feat as a disgrace for Amh.erst is said to have the best inter-collegiate rela.y team in the East. Hutchin's spoke to the fellows about marking up the notices on the .bulletin board. He re- marked. that everyth~ng on the board was import- ant and to destroy these notices was out of place. F·aust asked the Glee Club to remain after chapel. S. Cavert brought up the matter of crossing the Campus at this time of the year. He said that some of the students had crossed the Camp- us during the mild weather and had dug up the If you desire to see the couut.ry, be your own bose and make from $75 to $150 a month clear prn:fit at tb.e same time, it will pay you to start selling \Wear End Iluminum Cooking Utensils.\ The tL.ne to de:cide on your summer's work is novv.

REVIEW OF B.ASKETBALL SEASON. At the end of another basketball season tile total score is still against us, but th.e team showed a marked im:prove.ment over the wor·k of previous years, and whe.n we consider that most of our opponents were among the fastest teams in the state the showing made by the Union five is worthy of considerable praise. The fact that some men who would have been a strong addit;on to the team ·were unaJble to be i.n the game on account of pressure of college work was a dis- app·ointme.nt; but Coach Til d. en succeeded in round-ing into shape a team th;:tt ~woTked well to- gether and gave evidence of being a·hle to stay with their op.ponents, even when out-weighed al- , most to a man. The team had the supp·ort of the .student body throughout tr}_e season and proved thems·elves worthy of it by eoming back into the game in the se<cond half with the .score poor condition in the Spr'ng and so he urged the . against them and ·playing with as much vig·or and fe.Uows to take pride in the college and its ap- spirit as though victory were certain. The team loses only two men next year and turf. If this is continued the lawn will be in pearance and hereafter walk around the Ca::11pus rather than across it.

If you desire to pay your way through college --the fa.ct that more than 2,000 college students last ~ummer made an average .profit of $7.42 a day for every seven ·hours actual work that fact would be of particular interest to you, particularly if you have placed before you the names and addresses and the amount of sales :t.nade by each of the men whose re-cords are taken The Christian Association has now began a tnto ~~rc~mmt in securing the average. new regime.

t J . l J :! ~· •.. :i j I I ! l l I 10 THE C·ONCOI{D1~NSIS COLLEGE-AND AlFTE.RWARD. President Hadley, of Yale .. Tfhe old ·curriculum., with all its fault!s, had the element .of competition. Where an the .boys were studying the same thing, rank meant so:ne- thing to tl:iem all. With the introduction of t·he elective system we secu'red competition be- tween teachers and got better te.a·ching; but we have practkally done away with ·competiti-on he- \ tween students, and have lost at that end the stimulus that we gained at the other. Tihis loss has been a serious one. Much of the undue in- terest in athletics in o·ur ·college life today is Jue to the fact that this is the only place where there is real competition .a-:nong a number of 1nen of different types of character. It was a :mistake for the advocates of ti:ie old curriculum to think that all ··che students required the same treatment. It is, I believe, an equal mistake for the advocates of the elective system to think that each student requires a different treat:nent. F.,or while there is a very large number of sub- jects of interest to study, and an almost infini:e variety of occupations w·hicli tt~e students .are going to follow afterward, there ~ s a compara- tively small number of types of mind with which we lh:ave to Jea.l. If we can ·have four or :five honor ·courses,.~some­ tlling like those of the English universities~ where the studies are grouped and the exa-;ninations arranged to :neet the needs of these different types, we can, I tt1.ink, realize the chief advant- ages of the eleet!ve system or the group sys·tem wi hout subjecting ourselves to its evils. I am confident that we can secure a d~gree of col- lective intellectual in~erest which is now absent from most of our colleges, and can establish com- ~ pet!tions wb.i-ch . will be. recognized nnt only l_n coll-3.ge, but in the world as places where the best lllen can show what is in them. It ~a y be objecte-d that any su·ch arrange- ment would renJer it diffi·cult for a hoy to study tte particular things that h·e was going to use in after life. I regard this as its cardinal ad- vantage. The ideal college education seems to n1e to be one wlhere a student learns things that ·fie is not going to use in after life by methods th.a:t he is going to u·se. The former element gives the student brea·dth, W 1 hile the latter ele- ment giveos him the training. ALUMNI. 1.852-0n February 21 in 1New Brunswick,_ N. J., Baron Kikuchi, ... president of the Im~periaJ College of Japan, paid an impres·sive trihute to the late Dr. Dav:d Murray, a Union graduate in the class of 185·2, for his services in the _reconstnwtion of the educational system of Japan. A wreath· was · laid on his grave in Elmwood cemetery., and ~ parc~:hment containing a writ~en tribute frmn the Imperial College was presented to Mrs. Murray. While in 'college Dr. Murray was prominent in ' literary and social circles. He was the fouuder and first presid.ent of the Union Y. M. C. A. He was also the first president of the loc~l P.hi Beta Kappa· .society. He was one of the trus ~ees of the ·college from 1882 to 1889, and received the degrees of Ph. D. and L. :L. D. from Union. After graduating from college he became in- stru.ctor ar: d af.terwa.rds president of the Albany Academy. Lrater he became 9- professor of ma- themat· cs in Rutgers, where be gained .a great reputaJon· for executive ability.t In 1871 Japan sent a commission to this C·ountry to study Ameri· can systems of education and Dr. Murray re- turned with the1n. During his four years stay in that country progressive systems of education ·were installed and ~he educat'onal system raiseu to a high standard.
