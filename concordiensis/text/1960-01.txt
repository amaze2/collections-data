Last year (Continued on Page 6) DAVID K. BAKER Prof.Baker Chosen for St. Andrews President Carter David- son has recently announced that Professor David K. Baker has been chosen as Union College's exchange professor to St. Andrews University in Scotland for the academic year 1960- [961. Conceiv.ed by Fox: The custom of exchanging a professor with St. Andrews was conceived ·some 25 years ago in the spring of 1934 by Union's late president, Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox. Since that time, it has been suc- cessfully completed some ten times. Dr. Sven R. Peterson, Pro- fessor of Philosophy is currently teaehing at St. Andrews. Peter- son's able replacement this year is Professor Richard Smith. Professor Baker came to Union seven years ago, after receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. He is a member of the Physics Department or Natural Science as it- is called in 0 t • S • Scotland. St. Andrews will send C avzo zngers Professor D. M. McCall to replace Baker.

Construction will begin SO(}n, and the building is E'X- pected to be completed by December 1960. Davidson Describes Year In State of Union Text During the past academic year, Union has again kept its expenses lower thari income, according to the recently distributed \State of Union.\ <S> This year's bulletin opened with Cubicles Wired arrived at through this group Eno-ineers Honor Five will be forwarded to Albany e- an address by President David- son, describing some of the more important changes taking place on the Union College campus. The Schaffer library, w'hich will replace the 83 year old Nott Memorial building, will be located in the center of the campus be- tween Washburn Hall and Alumni Gymnasium. The Schaffer 'library will be the first 'unit of a great central plan for the development of Union College campus. The plan calls for future additi()nal buildings on each side of the li- brary and the demolition of Wash- burn Hall and the heating plant from the center of the campus. The plan is part of the eleven year, $15,000,000 long range de- velopment camprugn announced two years ago, where they will be tabulated and Four seniors and one junior sent to the makers of foreign pol- icy in Washington.

The operating expenses however, have increased proportionately over the same period. Must Do More The ne!W library will offer num- erous advantages over the present building. Besides providing more studying room, it will house under one roof the 190,000 books and periodicala whdch now overflocw from Nott Memorial library to an annex, and it w'ill meet the ex- panding requirements of the addi- tion of 4,000 to 5,000 volumes a year. The new Schaffer library will also be better lighted, heated, and ventilated than the old build- ing. Speaking in Tuesday Clupel, Dean C. William Huntley discussed the past fifty years at Union and the fifty years to come. ~------'·'------- In the President's report, Dr. Davidson remarked that at a con- vention of the Institute of Inter- national Educatio·rf, of which he is a trustee, our H.

It may also 'be possible to include some indica- tions of ifue cinematic arts as well.

Our present pro- posal is to convert the Adminis- tration building into an arts cen- ter, and the Nott Memorial into an administration !building. It seems a bit illogical to clb.ange a building whic'h is designed as an administration building into some- thing it is not, and to change a.notber edifice which has all the earmarks of a supenb arts center, with a bare mini:m<ti.Dl of creative evolvement, into a lhod.ge\Podge of office for an administration build- ing.

At ~lelpar, we believe that all young engineers and scientists should develop the habit of looking beyond the obvious. First, what is the obvious! It's obvious that you'1·e in demand. You don't have to worry about getti1;1g your material wants satisfied. And you don't have to worry about getting opportunities for professional growth. Since you are in demand, :vou can expect to get the things you want from any number of potential employers. But, if you look beyond the obvious, you'll l'eal- ize now that you're going to want something more than \want satisfaction\ out of your career. You're going to want pride-pride in your per-- sonal, individual contribution. At Melpar, where we are_ now working on 120 advanced defense and space exploration projects, we are interested only in young men who realize that pl'ide is a reward that extends much beyond the obvious. Because Melpar is a proud Company. We're proud of our IMAGINEERING approach to the solution of electronic problems; we're proud of our uninterrupted growth and controlled expan- sion; we're proud of the communities that sur- round our laboratories and plants in Northern Virginia and Boston, and we're proud ·of our cre- ation, design, and production of electronic prod- ucts destined for universal application. If you want an opportunity to be proud of your contribution and your Company, we're interested in hearing from you. Tell us about yourself. Either ask your college's Placement Director to arrange a personal interview with the Melpar representative who will be visiting your campus, or write to our Professional Employment Supervisor. Tell ll.hn if you would like to hear fro:tn one of your college's graduates who is now progressing at Melpar. -.::-:- . • . ~~f MELPAR¥1Nc y A SUBSIDIARY OF WESTINGHOUSE AIR 13RAKE COMPANY 3401 Arlington Boulevard, Falls Church, Virginia In Historic fairfax County .(70 mifel from Washington, D.

Hoyt was not accepting <tM my criticism. One of us had to go, and It had to be 'him. Blue- stein, on the other hand, was not helping us or himself ·by ·being on the team. He was una;ble to adjust himself to my way of do- ing things, and you can be sure that we weren't going to adjust the ball club to him. By quitting the team Mike ~ust beat me to the punch by a day or so.\ l't•rsonaliiy Con.flict The players relt that the trou- ble between them and the coach stemmed, from what they termed a personality conflict and from the fact that Witzel came to Un- ion with certain ideas that don't apply here. Hoyt na.ted that \When Ed Fedosky carne here he came with certain preconceived notions of what was to be ex- pected of a swimming team, but he was able to adapt his stand- ards to the Union situation.\ The implication is that Witzel has not, as yet, been able to acclimate himself to the ma.nner in which sports are set up at Union.

T•:u• <'Pl'l'lillOlly, <'Pll'bl'ating th<> bPginnlng of <'Onstru<'tion, tooir plaeP on V.'<>dnt>sday. It was maintained that at a small school such as Union, wherQ athletic scholarships are not awarded, athletes participate in intercollegiate sports because of the enjoyment they hope to derive from this experience. \When a sports program is run like a factory,\ Bluestein asserted, \a player cannot enjoy the game. Carl has a hard, unsympathetic personality. He never compli- mented us, but he was sure to yell when we did something wrong. His personality is entirely different from T'Om Cartmill's. Cartmill's personality won games for us last year. His spirit gave us the confidence that we needed to win.\ S.C .... ( Cor.tinued from Pa;.:t> : l the Student Council lost face ·when its views Wel'e com•pletely ignol'ed by the HPC, Now it's timl\ to rl\eva.lunte our position, and take a stronger stand.\ D!'an Edward Pollock, in taldng a middle of the road sta.nd, su·p- ported both groups claim of SU· pr<>macy b~: saying-, \The HPC and the Student Council exercise jurisdiction over various aspects of student !ifP. 'The HPC is sole- ly affected with fraternities. The Studt>nt Council's jurisdiction is a much broader one. Deferred rush- ing is most pa!'tlcula.rly a frater- nity problem. Howt•ver, in a case !<UCh as this, it is clea!' that the Studl\nt Council has some juris- diction.\ Since the general concensus of opinion was against the proposal, and for greater council influence, it was voted to defeat the motion of endorsement, ancl. request a 1·eport from the HPC, explaJning its reasons for its stand against deferred rushing. a--- Xmas Tourney (Continued from Page 5) gives a pl'etty good indication of the might of \Old Siwash.\ Coincidentally,· Knox •boasts as a forme!' president, Dr. Carter Davidson, who presided at Knox from 1936 to 1946, before he was lul'ed away by Union. · The Garnet gave more than an adequate account of themselves, actually outscol'ing the Siwashers from the field, 46-44. The differ- ence lay in a disease that plagued Union earlier this year, \foulitis.\ The Dutchmen were bogged down by the loss of its three big men,. Max Steele, Chuck Marshall, and Pete Houlihan on fQuls, in the second half. Coach 'Witzel's crew put up a good fight, but were unable to come any closer than eight points. Knox, with all-con- ference star Bill Graning leading the way, rolled ahead 15-9 at the ten minute mark, and 36-25 at halftime. Johnny Pelton popped in 14 to .pace the Garnet, with Walch chipping in 11. Pelton, Walch, and Ken Hoyt, were tab- bed with fuur personals in the late going. With three men al- ready out, this made the going precarious for. the six men Witzel had left for duty. Swimming~ ..

Orig- inally a backstroker he was con- verted to the free-style events two yea.t·s ago. Narrowly edged out in the New York State Champion· snips last year MacDonald will .be gunning for firsts there this year. Diamtond in the Rough Potentially sophomore Steve Diamond has the material to be rated with Ruth and MacDonald. Although off to a very slow start Diamond is coming along at a rapid rate, and coach Fedosky thinks that he has the ability to compete on a national level. Handling the breaststroke and in- dividual medley Diamond could very likely see service in the free- style sprints. One of the team's less known members is junior letterman Howie Adams. Swimming in the SePd Grt>ater Happort Witzel was described as being too remote, as holding too fast to the coach-player relationship. The plea was for a greater rapport in the everyday relationship. Hoyt admitted that \a friendly, per- sonal relationship is helpful to me. When this close feeling ex- ists I find I put myself out more than I normally would. This is not a conscious, intentional thing, ·but something that comes natur- ally. You're not playing for your- self any more. You're playing for the coach. Playing for your coach is extremely different than play- ing for your sohool, or for your own enjoyment.\ It was felt that Witzel failed to assess each person as an in- dividual and in various contexts. Some players must be treated differently than other players. One can't apply a hard and fast rule in dealing with human be- ings. \Carl misinterprets an hon- breaststroke last year Adams had r - •-- ----- - - - .,. the misfortune to follow in back I of state champion Pete Herman. 1 Other lettermen include seniors FOR CAR TROUBLES Lew Buckman, Scott Flannagan SEE A UNION M I and John Lubetkin.
