THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. 34: NO. 11 JANUARY 14, 1911 WEST POINT DEFEATED. --- By Union :Basketball Team-Score, 13 to 12. Opening the season in a whirlwind manner, the Union CoLege basketball team defeated the West Point five at West Point last Saturday, the score being i3-12. u·nion played a very close guarding game and excelled in passing, whHe West Point, unable to carry the ball up the floor, was forced to make long ·shots which were, \fot the m-ost part, unsuccessful. The Garnet In en were outweighed about 35 pounds to the man, but were faster and sure: in hot11 passing and shoot- ing. They were handi•capped to some extent by \Union r·ernained. in the lead ·during the entire llalf, except that during a short time the score was tied at 8-8. Heqltembourg then shot tw0 li>askets in succ·ession. This, with a free thro\V hy Coward, placed Union four points in the lea]. During the remaining tim·e, W·e'St Point was uil- a. ble to score except on fouls, the final score iJe- :ing 13-12. UNION. Roberts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . McKinstry Right Forward. the Intercollegiate rules, for ovt of bounds, by tl'·e floor and by the :iveUness of the bac,ks. For the fi:.:·st five minutes, neither side maJ·o a field goal, allhough Sutton for W·est Point ca~ed CA:PTAIN MICKS AND MANAGE:R :.A,TKIN. two fre·e throws. Then McKinstry made a goal for Union and even·ed n1atters. During the e:n- tire half the playing was hard and \fast and sBvel'- al fOl: ls were called, ·eSl~ecially on Union. Dutt011, the Army fre·e goal thrower. was decidedly off while Coward for the Garnet five was sure. Tile haU closed with the score at 7-6 ill favor of Union. The ·second half was a repitition -of the :fir~t to a great extent. Both sid·es played thei1' fastest and the guarding was hard and clo3e.

Th€ team will miss Coward's consistent work at forward, but it is hoped a worthy substitute can be found for the next couple .of game·s. Dr. l\1:cComher went with the team to West Point and thoroughly inspected the gymnas1un1 there, looking 1neanwhile for points for the new Union gymnasium. West Point has one of ill·e best gyn1s in the country and Union's new build·

COLLEGE HOCKEY TEAM WILL PLAY LOCAL CLUBS. The prospects for the esta.bUshment of hockey as a sport in the Gollelge see:rn.s to he brighter than ever before. The Freshman class contail1b n1uch good n1aterial, and has sh·own its enthus- iasm by electing a manager, and will play 'Seven1l games with nearby instituti-ons. It has not been thought w is.e to attempt, as y.et, an intercoll-egiate schedule for a 'varsity team, but the Athletic Boar·d. has sanctionerl games with the Boat Club a11d the Golf Club_ Several int-er-class games will als·o he played. It is hoped thHt either next y-ear or the following year Union will be represented in the intercol- legiate hockey world. PHILOMATHEANS WIN THE ALLISON·--FOOTE DEBATE \Resolved That tb..e ownership of the forest ' I and rrdn·eral lands, now ·belonging to the United States in the several states should be retained by the federal governn1e11t. The Adel'phic So- ci-ety defe:n/led the affirmativ-a side, and the Phil- omatheans, the negative. Keckaley presided for thP Adelphie Society, s.nd Maxon for the Philo· matheans, ·Cavert, th!e president of the .society, b€ihg on the debate. The speakers on. th€ two tea~ns were ets foBows: Ad-e~phic-Hoy Peters, 12; lVI. vV. Bra)~ '11; H. F1. Blodgett, 11, and Ra:ph Streever. :i2, alter- nate. Philomath·Aan-Harry Gordon, 11; W. D. Cavert, 11; J. H. Potter, 12, a.nd A. B. Mann, alter- nate. Peters, in the opening speech for the affirma- tiv-e, showed that the gr.eeCJ of corporations and private owners is fast exploiting otlr forest and mineral resources, and that the existing evils are avoided by federal ownership. Gordo:n., in opening the debate for the nega- tive, carefully analyzed the question, and main- tajned that the n·egative would clhow a more rational mellns of conservation than by the fed· eral governme-nt. ·In continuing the debate for the affjr .. :native, Bray showed that if the federal government gave up control of the lands, they won1d come under the sul)ervision of the state and wo.uld not be efficiently ·conserved, showing that the states were neglecting their duty in thi~ res nect. Cavert, for the negative, showed that the for- ·est land should be owned by the states because u~e natton already has more than it can attend to and wonld not be a.s car·eful of the fo:~ests as the states; and, als.o, since the states already h1ve control of ~our-fifths of tu·3 for€st.s, reaRon dPn1ands that it shou:d own the other fifth. Blodgett clos-ed the debate for the negative and endeavored to show that ownershi.t: by the 1u:1tion is legallv, norally and a'11nini2tratively Potter Wins lndiv'.dual Prize. right. The annual Allison-Foote prize -debate, wl1icb Potter closed th-e direct argument of the de- v.ras held jn the chapel on Monday evening was won by the Phi1on1athean Society and the in{] i. vidual p~·ize was award·ed to. Jame8 H. Potter, th.e Fhi~omathean's last speaker. Thf3 subject for the debate was as foJlow: bate. He dealt with the conservation of our min- eral resources in a ·cl·ear manner, and showed that the proper solution of the question demand· ed that the ~nines should be own =.d. and leas~d by the states.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 The ·direct argument was followed bv the re- buttal ·speeches, afte·r which the judges held a brief con.sultatiou and :decided in favor of the negative. The judg.es were as follows: George Lawyer of Alban.y, chairman; Robert J. ·san:::~oP of. Am- sterdam, and J,ahn A. T. Sc.hwarte of Saratoga. co.,operate with the newly organized Dramatic ClHb in sending .out post cards announcing the :P'erf.ormance of \What Happened to Jones\ whiell is to take p.la<}e next Tuesday.

During the FaH term the Press Club accom· plished more than at any other time in its exist· anc-e. The number of candidates for member· ship was unusually large and the work was ·done in an able manuer. On D•ecember 14th the fin~l meeting was held and the reports of colnnlittecs were rec-eived. Some idea of the scope of the w-ork .of the Press Club may be gained from the following facts: A bulletin of 'weekly news of the UniversHY ha·s been sent out to nearly 75 newspapel'S throughout the country. ,Almost a thousand post- cards have been sent out to alumni of the neigh· .borin\g· tcities announcing th-e various footbafl gan1es.

WORK AM01NG The n.ew movement that OUR :FQ:REIGNER'S. our Co\Lleg>e Christian As- eociation haa initiated in enlist1ng Unton men in doing educational work among the foreign speak- ing pop·ulation o.f S·chenectady is one that merits the approval and co-o-peration. of every :nan in college. It is probably not very generally ·hn.cwn that then~ are in this industrial city .ov.er 20,0{10 of thes·e fo.reign speaking peop:es, or fully 30· per e~nt of our -population.. s,chenectady authorities tell us that of the Italians .a~one th·ere are fully 6,000 and ·Of the Poles an equal or even gre2.ter nunl·ber. It is alrnoat impossible to over-esth:oate the value of this work to the foreigner. It may help him to become a better worl{man~ c-ommand highe:· wages, understand tlle A.n€rican people and customs, and to beeome an. Ainericar. citiz~?>n. '~or is the value on the side of the foreigner alone, for the stud€nt leader get-3 experience tb.qt wLl €nable him to t~nderstanu tll.e forelgn work· wen, to sympathize with his -point of view, a:nd tn judge men fairly and correctly. Such servjce as thia is a wo:\k that sould con1e wah a forceful ap p€a: to college men. Sucb wo::-k is real Christian service of a v-ary definite and practical kind. THE D-RAMATIC Cnion at ~ast hat, a real ASS,QCIATION Dramatic Aa·:;ociat.on .. Aft81' rrany vain atte:n-pts in previous y€'-:,rs, at last an association has be-en organized which bids fair to deserve enroLment among the many 8ur· cessful o:·ganization.s which already exist at our college.

BASKETBALL. Union's basketball season has had an auspicious opening.

The first of the .series of musicals to he given in the CoUe\ge Chapel this :winter occured Tue~· day night when the Dolmetsch Trio gave a pro- gram of 17th r.entury music. The chapel wa.s d·ecorated for th-e occasion with running pine an(l written. Following an introductory taik, M-r. Dolmetaca render·ed two selections~ one of which wa·s ~wr:lt­ ten by William Byrd about 16·0·0. Mlle. E-rnestine Gauthier, ac:companied iby Mrs. Dolro.etsch on the Viola d' Amore, sang son1e of the songs ~conn110ll in Shakespeare's time, and then various pleces w-ere p:ayed on the haT];J sichord. the clavichord, the Viola. de Gamba and the Viola il' A:nore. The fi:s t two of these resem.ble somewhat our n1odern piano while the latter two are like the 'cello anli violin, r€'spectiv-ely. Tl!te· ~clavichord was reserved by Mr. Dolmetsch for tbe last as it is his favorite instrument. The music was so cbosen .as to bring out the full possibilities of the instrument, and so well were the selections pla:yed that he was obliged ~o encore sev·eral times before the audience w:Is 5~tisfied. The musical well served its purpose, giving the audience an idea of old fashioned musi- cal instruments upon -which a great deal of onr best classica: mnsic witS written, and r lso lJ.ow this music r·eally soun~ed on them.

Heaven, but unlike t!le Heaven you read of, where white spirits float about, pro:duc- in,g angelic strains on golden harps, the people were all in skeleton form. As we approa•ched the gate w·e heard, above the rattle o.f the bones, voices ·engaged in heaterl discussion. We made the double-quick to be in on the finish and found St. Peter arguing with a tall, lank skeleton, which woe at once .r-ecognized a'S one of our old friends. As usual, our friend. was in a Mix because he did not have th-e proper cr-edentials and Pet-er was not .going to pass him in. You w•ere soon able to s-et things straight, however, and we all went in togeth€r. vVe happened to engagre in conv·ersation with a. sad, rickety looking skeleton, which we soon r·ecognized as that of Blodgett. We learned that the Counsel had· be-en able to pull the W·ool over the eyes of St. Peter, in the ·same manner th2t he used to work the faculty, and the old saint had engalged him as his assistant. 'The Counsel willingly showed us about th€ pla,ce. He pointed out two fellows who wer·e. ;A~s we ·s.auntered a.bout the place we m·et the d::~.pper looking tittle skeleton of Ted S~mmons.

They W·ere none too soon, for St. John came ri-ding through the crowd like a mad-man., looki~g neither to right nor l€ft. ''H·e ·a.on't r·eally b-elong here,\ the Counsel ·explained, but he has been going so fast that none of us hav·e dared to stop him. As we coinp:eted th-e tour oi the h~is.sfnl region, you turned to our guid·e and expressed your regret that you had not happened to meet any of the faculty. \The faculty,\ you won't find then1 here,\ said tli-e Counsel, \you 1nust remember that. this 'is H-eaven.\ Strane;e dream, wasn't t: .... : You kuow that it ha·s been proved now that dr·eams ar.e really vis:. ions of the truth.

THE CONCORDIENSlS VOL. 34 JANUARY 21, 1911 NO. 12 FIRST PRESiENTATION O.F \WHAT :HA1P'PENED TO JONES\ TAK:ES HOUSE BY STORM Mohai·r Makes the Hit of the Eveningr. The DramaUc As·sociation, in their first ·pre- sentation of \What H·a.ppen€d to Jones,\ in tne Van rCurler on Tuesday night, cover·ed £self wHn paint and glory and is now enrolled among fne :perso-nality, and his portrayal of the unfortunate Bish.o,p added mu·ch to the success of the play. The feminilite characters were cleverly played, and th-e beauty O'f the actors drew many blushes ·O:f envy from the fair maidens in the au·dience. Cissy, the ward of the professor, was a charming 'little Vassar girl, unusually wise for •h€r age, who cam€ near being the undoing of Jones. ·Simmons, as Marjorie, th€ profes-sor's daugh- ter, took t•he pa.rt of the romantic girl, playing many suecessful student organizatio·ns on tll0 the r·ole with the eas·e of a profes·sional a·ctor. Riedinger, as Minerva, was a qui-et girl of stli- dious tendencies, who preferr€d to spend her time in r·eading Darwin and Huxley, instead ot wasting it by reading poetry as did her sister Marjori€. \hill.\ The play was given under the auspices of U1c Phyrsicians' H·ospital, and the theatre was W€11 e filled with an appreciative au.di·ence composefl Df students and. local society p€ople. Each act was encored sev€ral times, and thB musical .specialties, whi•ch were introduced be- tween the acts, were well received. E:Very person in the cast showed the resu1t of Mr. Mott's efficient coaching, and. while some mistakes were ma-de, so clev€rly were the parr.:; carried out, that th·ey could not be det€cted by those in the audi·enee. Many p:ersons were pr·e£·ent who had seen the plays produ·ced by Col- ·Sawyer, as Alvina Starlight, made a tyrpica t old maid·en ''a11ntie,\ and by her lov€ for the \wrong n1an\ add€d much to the fun of th€ au- di-enee. Goods-ell, the professor'·s wife, Matilda, was the careful hous-ewife, who cared more for the comfort .o.f her 1guests than of her family, and when the .professor's mind began to wander, shed hug-e cro·C>Odile tears that made her hus- band swear. Ca vert took the part of .Helma, tlle gate, Cornell, Yale, and other college.s who have Swedish servant girl, and while able to tall{ a reputatiDn for colleg.e dramatics, and all agr·ee·:i nothing hut broken English, ·showed the a.bility v~ at Union'·s production surpassed them an. ·Of tbe foreigners. to roeadily compr·ehend the Mohair Makes Hit. meaning of money. ·Mohair, as \Jones\ was the hit of the nlghr.

The !part is an unusually difficult one, as it involv-es much facial expression. rC.offin, as .Anthony Ooodley, D.

UNION :oEaATlNG TEAM W.ILL ME.ET CORN:E·L.L TO-NIGHT. Interesting D·ebate Expected. An interesting debate is ~xpected when the Union College debating team meets. the Cornell orato:-s in the chap.el to-night. This is the first Ume that Union has ever debated a college of Cornell's size a.nd reputation a~d the home teRm, consisting orf Harry A. Gordon, Walter D Cavert, James H. Potter and Ralph Streever. alternate, have been working ever since Christmas vacation in pr€paration f\r to-night's cont~st. The question is the same a.s that which was rece.ntly debated by the Adel:Phic and Philoma- thean soceieties: \Reso:v:ed Tlt;3..t the ownership of the for-est and :uineral lauds, now belonging to the United States in the several states, should be retained by the Federal government:· Uni0n defe.n,d:s the affirmative. All of the membel~s of the Cornell tealn are PRE.SlD,ENT R:!CHMOND'S VIEWS ON COLLEGE 'SONG·S AND CH:EER:S. \It ought not to .surpris·e uq to hear that Presi- de.nt Lowell does not find organized cheering a perfect m·edium for the expressio.ru o:L emotion. l:t is not meant to be. To the .college man it is a .sy:nbol of soUda.rity. It is his way of ·Saying, 'We are with you!' It is neither melodious nor capable of de11cate modulation, but it is loud a:nd hearty and 1!1.].)011 the whole a fair expresston for the mood of the m:on1ent. Moreover, it is the only way he can get into the game. Only a few a:re gifted with a.thl.etic s.kill, but every man has a voice. \Vhen an emotion stirs his heart ol' when the Lord ·Sends him n thought he mak~s f,O:ne kind of a noise, and when they all fe~l the s·a1ne emotion they all make the same noise -some more, some less.. This is n0t the only way in which he .can express himself. I have sometimes heard a vociferous silence on one side of the arenn. at a football ga:ne; silel!re which held in it thonghts too deep ·for tears. \Undergraduate ps.ychoiogy is. 'Still a terra in- cognita to me, but so far as I c~n understand him enthusiasm is •his strong point. and wnen he rr akes1 a noise he must make a loud noise. Or- ganized cheering is at le'tst as pleasing to the ear as the straggling go- .. ls-you-pl{~ase · cheer of tbe old 'grads'; and although I .::-..m one myself ! have been glad to learn and to practise the modern way of doing it. debaters of experience and have a~quired a rep- utation in their own university ·for their oratori- cal ability. L. S. Ness, a janior in the Arts ·College, will o.pen the debate for tlJ.e vis-itors. J\'fr. ·Ness has been a me:nber ot the Cor.nel1 Congress team against Alfred. Un:Jversity, and h0s spoken on the '94 Men1o:rlal l)rize Debate. tT. E. Griffith, their second sp-eaker, is n. senior in the .Art5 College, and .has been a member ·Of the Cornell team against boP1 Pen·.Lsylvania and Columbia. He h?.s, also, won the '94 .Memorial \What I s·hou:d like to hear is more ~inging. College singing is· on-e of the best thing~ in col- lege life, and I wish thP.re we ·e ·:.no''e o·f it and of a better sort. I should hate to be:leve that the r-ongs coll-ege men sing are a genuine expression of the thoughts of their hearts. \Son1e tilne ago I sat wllh a jnJge of the Court of Ar;IJeals at a college dinner and joined b1ithe1y with hiiD in singing 'Oh, giivc; n1e a drink, bartender!' Speaking ·Only for myself, I rnotest that the song was not the voice of an inwa:~o longi.ng. We sang it as we ate the food provided in the menu, because the otllers tHd.

Indeed, ihe fervor and -conviction which the col:ege n1an throws . .into his. c:oUeg.e t;-Ong give it a ce.rtain nobility apart from its intrinsic merit. \Upon t·he whole, I am. not agai.n,st college che-ering in more moderation, exc-o.pt when it is us-ed, as it sometimes is, in. an unplePsant way to confuse or discourage a rival team. It is a healthy kind of noise, and the cheer 1eader w!th hi·s antics. adds to the gayety of .nations.

THE CON;CORDIENSlS VOL 3-± JAN:UARY 28 1911 ' NO. 13 UNIO·N FIVE tAKE SCALP: OF FAST' ROCHESTER TEAM. Final Score-Union, 20; Roche£,ter, 18 .. Fulfilling every early promise' and showin.g bet- ter _ asketball than was looked for by eve:n. the 111.0St hopeful the Garnet five won the·' second game of the season by defeating the 'Rochester aggregation by the dose score of 2o-r8. The gr1me was a most exciting one and up to the very last few minutes of play the issue was in doubt. In the early part of the game, Union was 1n the lead, but a Rochest·er rally tied the score and then put the visitors in the lead. !Dur- ing the last ten n1inutes of play, however.~ our men took a brace and went to the front. !From then on, although close, the gatne was ·practically-' decided. McKinstry played well for Union, whlle Ed.wards, tl-:e Rochester captain, was the s!h1ning light for the visitors. The Rochester five, although defeated by Col- gate on Friday, came here strong and rea.d:y for the gan1e. Union was handicapped by t~e loss of Coward at guard, but \Beefy''· Leon was in the gan1e and proved cone ~usively that he could I( eorne back.\ ~either f. ide ~cored for the first few tninutes, when McKinstry caged a free throw for the Garnet. Rochester retaliated, but Mc- K.instry tnade another. Then the baskets began to c01ne and each side caged two. At the end of the half, the soore stood 8-7 in favor of Union. During the intern1ission, the en thusiasrn ,oF the stuuents rose to overflowing at the prospect of a v1ctory. The second half was an illustration of the real game of basketball and the playing was fast and furious. Frotn the very start it vvas touc~ and go. Rochester was in the lead until M c Kiinstry cc..ged a basket and later a fc;ul. Then l:e threw an )the r ba:1ket. This put the Garnet in the· lead, <m~l, although the playing was hard, the final ~ct,re stood 20- I8 in favor of the Garnet: During this half, Bru1n1n replaced Leon at guard. Later f 1 .L11n1 injured his knee and his :~ ~-··:; \\·a.3 taken uy -Duchscherer, who played a close guard gatne. The line-up of the two teams was as follows: UNION (2o). ROCHESTER (r8).

6 THE CONCORDl ENSIS. UNION'S DEBATERS WIN VICTORY FROM CORNEL:L. the mineral situation could be best so~ved by hav- ing the nation own the n1ines and lease them un.- ~ der regulation to private interests. Unanimous Decision in Ravor of Home Team. The Union College debating team gained a de- cisive victory last Saturday night when they de- feated the Cornell orators in the college chapel. This is the first time that our tean1 has ever· de- bated a college of Cornell's size, and the victory gives Union a reputation in debating work that is on a par with any other college in the state. During the past four years Union has defeated Rutgers, Albany Law School, Hamilton (three titnes), Colgate and Cornell, her only defeat be- ing the one received fron1 Colgate in the tri-lea- gue last year. The subject for the debate was \Resolved That the ownership of the forest and tnineral lands, now belonging to the United States in the sev- eral states, should be retainea by the Federal govcnnnent.'' The speakers for Union on the affirmative w·ere H. A. Gordon, 'r I; W. D. Cavert, 'I I; J. H. Potter, 'Iz, and Ralph Streever, alter- nate. The following students frotn Cornell de- fended the negative: H. E. Griffith, 'I r, Arts; L. E. Neff, 'I2, Arts; G. H. Brown, 'II, Law, and H.. E. Pierce, alternate. The Cornell deuaters were all polished speak- ers and they presented a pleasing appearance on the stage, but their debate throughout showed a lack of tean1 work and of constructive argument. The Union teatn, by devoting the second speech to the conservation of the forests and the third, to the conservation of the minerals was able to present the question n1ore clearly and to keep both issues definitely before the tninds of the judges. Gordon, in opening the debate, showed that the only reasonable definition of the tenn ''forest and mineral lands\ was that only those lands which are rnore valuable for their forest and tnineral products than for any other purpose, coulu he properly so called. He then proved that there is a pressing necessity f.or conserving our forest and mineral lands, and by a careful process of elimination showed that the forests would be best preserved if they were owned and' developed by the Federal government, o.ut that Griffith,. in opening the debate for the visitors,. failed to outline any constructive argument. He opposed the question because of its enormity, and maintained that a government that can not effici- ently run a post-office or build battleships as. cheaply as individuals, should not be entrusted with the fo·rest and mineral lands. Cavert, Union's second speaker, confined him- self to the question of the conservation of the· forests. He showed that the preservation .of the· forests is es·sential for the protection of rivers, the preventing of erosiun, and the insuring of our· fntute timber supply, and that the Federal gov- ernment can preserve the forests for these pur-· poses better than any other owner. He further showed that the forests should be retained in or- cler that the Federal governtnent 1night have a: place in whic-h to carry on scientific investiga- tions ,and in order to aid in the development of the west. Neff, the second speaker for the negative,. showed in a humorous way that the affirmative were in f~vor of taking tnore radical steps than: President Taft, President Van Hise of Wisc·on- p sin University, or any other federal c·onservation-· ist were advocating. He also proved that private owners are not now as wasteful as they have for'- n1erly been, and that the Chicago Meat Packing, Company uses all of the pig but the squeal. Patter closed the direct argument for the af- f n-native. He found the solution of the c·onser- vation of o11r mineral resourc·es in a systetn whereby the Federal government should retain the ov\rnership of the mines, but lease thetn to private interests under definite regulations. He showed that this tnethod could prevent exporta- tion and unnecessary waste, and that it was not a new and untried scheme. Brown, in concluding the direct argU111t}nt, tried to show by analogy that the proper solution o.f the question was regulation by the states, and not ownership by the Federal government. He proved that the state. has the legal right, hut failed to show that it has the physical power and the willingness to regulate.

~ri-tE C00-JC01{i)iE~SIS. 7 The Ret>uttaL Union had the better of the argtnnent 111 the .rebuttal speeches. The negative admitted the pnnciple that the Federal governn1ent should own .all forests essential for the protection of inter- state rivers, but tried to show that there wer.e tnany n1i11ion acres which wer·e not essential for such a puqilose. The affirn1ative showed that all the national forests are essential for the PJl:.otec- tion of inter-state interests, .and that where there . .are no rivers, there are no national forests. As for the n1ineral lands., they showed that no valid objections had been brought forward against a federal leasing systetn, and that they had shown no other way to prevent the exportation of tnin- . erals which should be kept in our own. country. Decision U nanimouE .. The Board of Judges, consisting of Judge H. V. Borst of An1sterda1n, chairn1an, Mr. Jan1es Potts of Troy, and H on. John H. Burke- of Balls- ton Spa, then withdrew, and after a short con- sultation rendered a11 unanin1ous decision in favor of Union. The victory was n1ade the n1ore de- ' cisive for d1e ho1ne tea.rn by the facts that Judge Borst is a Cornell alun1nus, and that Mr. Potts now has two claug'·.ters in under-graduate courses . at Cornell. THE TRI-LEAGUE DEBATE. Firr.t Try-Out Next Monday. The first try-out for the triangular debate be- tween Union, Colgate and Han1ilton will be held in the chapel on next ]\1onclay afternoon.

TRUSTEES AND BOARD OF GOVERNORS BO'TH MEET. Bryce for Holilorary Chancellor-Closer Univer- sity Unity-Action Taken About Gom,mons-· Heating Plant to Be Moved-Graduate C&uncil Plan Approved. Matters of vital importance to Union Colleg-~ and Union University were discussed in Albany on last Tuesda::y when the regular January n1eet ings ot both the Board of Trustees and the Board of Governors were held. There was a full at- tendance at the n1eeting of both boards. Bryce for Chancellor. The Board of Governors selected the Hon. Jatnes Bryce, an1hassaclor to the l.initecl States fron1 England, as honorary chance11or for the con11nencernent next June. It will be ren1en1- bered that Am·1Jassador Bryce was cQ.osen to fill this position I ast year, but was unable to act, owing to his being called to England on official duties as the resaLt of the death of K,ing Edward. Unless unforeseen engagen1ents arise, it is ex- pected that Mr. Bryce will act a.s Honorary Chan- cellor of the University next June. Reports which were receiYed frotn the differ- ent departments of the e.niversity show that t~c University as a whole is now in a prosperous condition. TI1.e moven1ent for the erection of a new ouilding in the 111eclical department \\-a:-> heartily endorsed, and it was reported that $7,00,1 had already been suhscrihecl for t~1e Mc;)o:la·d 1v1e1norial Lah ora tory. Closer University Unity. A committee was appointed by the Board o' Governors to consider the best means for bring- ing the different departments of the e niversity into closer relations with each other. Otie plan which has been suggested is that there 1night be but one con1n1encen1<:nt for all of the depart- ments. The 1ne1nber~ o· this con1mittee have not yet ueen announced, hut they will soon he ap- pointed and tne 1natter of creating closer unity in the e niversity will h:: carefully considered. Our Prer.ent Urgent Needs. In his report to the Board of Trustees, Dr. Richmond na 111ed the following as our n1ost urgent needs at present: First, a new gymnasiun1 and athletic field; second,. a chapel; third, donni- tory and com1110iis: f·1tuth, a new _1le::·=·:\ 1 1 ' 1

8 oratory; fifth,. an addition to the electrical labora- tory; sixth, an increase in our endowrne11t of at least one tnillion dollars; s·eventh, scholarship. ''There is certainly no institution more worthy oi generous support,'' said Dr. Richtnond, ana we l)elteve that all these needs w·ill be supplied in . ,, tnne. The tt·ustees expressed their approval of the present plans for the new gy1n, but no site for the building will be selected until a larger sun1 of money has been raised. College Commons. 1 he petition for the establishment .of a college comtnons, signed by one hundred ancl thirty un- der-graduates, was favorably received by the trus- tees. A comn 1 ittee was appointed to investig·ate the matter and to present a definite plan for the While there is establishment of the cotnl:nons. no prospect of its being started now certain that there will be 'C nion within a very few years. Graduate Council. this year, it ts a commons at 1 he President of Union's graduate council, the Hon. William P. Rudel, Supreme Court Justice, reported to the trustees on the organization of +-he council. The plans for the better organiza- tion of the Union Alun1ni were heartily endorsed by the trustees, who voted, in case it was neces- :::ayr, to finance the council for at least two years. In order that the Alun1ni may not be continually asked for contributions to different purposes, the graduate council will have charge of raising all funds frotn the graduates, endeavoring to per- suade them to contribute a certain atnount to the college each year. Mr. Waldron, 'o6, secretary of the council, re- ported that three new Alumni organ-izations had oeen formed during the past year. To Move Heating Plant. President Richtnond presented a scheme to the trustees for removing the college heating plant to the Locomotive Works. · In case this should be d )ne, the proposed plant would use the big sn1oke stack at the works, and the steam would be carried through conduits to the college build- ings. This proposition tnet with the approval of the trustees, because it would not only tnove the eve-sore of the college grounds, but would in all probability result in a tnore efficient heating sys- tenL 1\illore definite action on the 1natter will probably be taken at the June n1eeting. A proposed revision of the by-laws of the board was tnade by ex-President AlexaNder_ Dr. Alex- ander is in favor of holding three yearly meet- ings instead of two as at present. If three w·ere held, the January and June meetings wou1d be as at present, and a third would be h.eld in Sche- nectady in OctoDer. The proposed also involved the appointing of an executive co1n1nittee which would n1eet at the request of the President. The meetings of this com.mittee wo11ld. probably be held e\rery n1onth, and thus many important mat- ters could be directly attended to without wait- ing for the meeting of the trustees. IF YOU HAVE THE GIRL, ·GET THE MONEY AND GO TO THE JUNIOR \PROM\ AND THE SOPHO·MORE SOIREE. DR. ANGELL'S PSYCHOLOGY LECTURES WELL ATTENDED. On Monday and Tuesday evenings of the past week the first two of a series of eight psychology lectures were delivered by Dr. James R. Angell in the college chapel. Dr. Angell, who is the head of the Psychology Departtnent in the University of. Chicao-o comes ::::> ' to L.Tnion especially recommended for this lec- ture course by the I~te Professor James of Har- vard, and the attendance of students and towns- people at the first two lectures clearly indicates that the people are awake to the privi! ege of lis- tening to one of the best authorities in Arn~rica on the subject of psychology. In treating his subject Dr. Angell hrings to bear tl-:e lucidity, consistency, and consecutive- ness of a born le:>gician, and together with smoothness of speech and perfect .command of his mother tongue, renders the steps from the simple to the con1plex easy to follow. The first two lectures of the cottrse were on the subjects of \General Psychology\ and \Psy- siological Psychology,\ and the next two lectures which will be delivered on February sixth anJ seyenth respectively will be on \Experitnental Psychology'' and ''Abnormal Psychology.\ The full course of the eight lectures are all to be pub-- lished under the seal of the college. :·j ~ ' ·• ,··) .t ... i ·.:~ l :\ = Th ] thi lllf' tw cal he an1 as Th we on lar At an teE ffil du the th< be It E rr gn tht ln~ qu I tiv po as fOJ ce lnl co ta: '\.'\'( th

. ' .· } i THE CONCORDI£NSIS. 9 PRESIDENT CHARLES A. AIKEN. The Third in the Series of Articles ·on Men Famous in Union's History. Rev. Charles A. Aiken, whose picture is the third one which adorns the chapel balcony., look- ing from the pulpit, was Union's President for two years, shortly after the Civil War. He was. called to the presidency fro1n Princeton where he was Professor of Latin Literature, at a trying and critical period in the history of the .college, as the war had been a sad blow to o:ld Union. The regular work of the college had been inter- rupted ana the total number of students during the first year of his presidency was only one hun- dred and thirteen . It was in large measure due to his interest and work in behalf of the college that Union was once more placed on a sound basis and the regu- lar coHege work resumed. It was President AtKen who first instituted the custom of having . an annual report sub1nitted to the Board of Trus- tee-s by the President. The report which he sub- mitted during the first year of his presidency, pro- duced such a favorable effect on the trustees that they accorded hin1 a vote of thanks and decided that in the future, a con1prehensive report should be prepared each year by the head of the col- It ge. At the close of his first report to the trustees, rresident . 1.1Ken said: \The short time annually given by the board to C')nsultation and action on the interests of the co:lege, appears to me quite insufficient fot our emergencies. But if tnore fre- quent meetings are undesirable or impracticable, I would urge the appointing of a suitable execu- tive comn1ittee with full powers to act on all im- portant matters.\ This it is seen that even at as early a period as this, President Aiken realized the necessity \ for a measure very sitnilar to that which was re- cently advocated oy Dr. Alexander at the meet- ing of the Board of Trustees-that an executive committee shoulct be appointed with power to take action on all important 1natters without vvaiting for a meeting of the trustees. NEW STAR CATALOG BY PROF. BOSS, UNIVERSITY ASTR,ONOM.ER. Most Important Astronomical Work of the Year. Prof. Lewis Boss, A. M., LL. D., of the Dudley Observatory, has ].)'resented to the college library a oopy of his \General Catalog of 6r88 Stars for the Epoch .of 1900.\ This is the first publication o± his valuable work for which he received a gold medal from the Royal Astron01nical Society of London, as being the author of the \most im- portant astronomical work of the year.\ 'fh:is catalog has been highly commended by m·any scientific magazines and has been called the tnost importa:m_t work of the kind which has ever ueen published. This Yolume is to be fol- lowed hy others, w:1ic~ will catalog all together so:me 22,000 stars. Other Additions to Library. A book on the ''Fundamentals of Education\ 1 as been presented to the library by its author, Prof. George L. Rayn1ond of George Washing- ton University, Washington, D. C. The Rev. E. t.- Rice, '54, a well known mis- sionary, has presented the library of his college with his ''Orientalisms in Bible Lands.' 1\\b e library has ordered and will receive as soon as it is printed, tll'e new edition of the Ency- dopedia Brittannica. Many other new books are a:lso beitig ordered. DR. KNOX OF UNION SEMINARY SPEAKS ON DAY OF PRAYER. Dr. George W. Knox of Union Seminary de- livered the sennon at the annual observance of the Cay of Prayer for Colleges last Thursday in the chapel. Dr. Knox, who is an able speaker, de J:iver·ed an impressive sermon on the text, \For he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.\ Dr. Knox was a missionary in Japan for over fifteen years in the earlier part of his life, and has a wide reputation as the author of religious works in both English and Japanese.

A word ot hearty and unstinted co1nmendatio1:1 of the Icha·bod Spencer Lecture- ship on Psychology seen1s quite apropos, now that Dr Ange1l has been with us and has delivered the first two of his series of lectures. No fur- ther evidence of the interest that has been arous- <Sd in these lectures is needed than the fact that on noth .even.ings the college chapel has hdd larger audiences than have probably ever gather- ed there for any other purpose. But it ·is quite noticeable, and very much to be regretted, that the student body has no't been as keen in its appreciation ot the great value of these lectures as the Schenectady public has been. Hardly one-fourth of the audience has been made up of our stttcl.ents. Is it not a significant com- ment upon the trend of n1odern ·coUege senti- nTent, not only at Union uut in practically all of our American universities,. that a student body will turn out en n1asse to witness a footb_all gatne; but only a small percentage of the students will avail themselves voluntarily of such rare op- portunities for deeper knowledge and broader ~ view-point as the mastertullectures o-f Dr Angell afford? No college man can afford to be ignorant of such a broad and culture-giving subject as modern psych.:ology. Is it not wi~e for us all to stop and give a few m.inutes of serious thought ·' s to what is our real purpose in being at Union College? JUNIOR WEEK! Once more the f e:::.tive tin1e of the college year has returned.; and thoughts are turned from the daily routine of study, eyen fron1 athletics, to the lighter events of theatre parties, fraternity dances, the Soiree. and the Prom. Junior Week serves a real purpose in college- lite. Coming as it' does at the middle of the college year, it affords a few days of welcome freedom fro1n t.he ordinary· tasks and bids us think only of mirth and delightful social( times together. No one would say that the main pur- pose of fottr years at college is to attain social culture, and yet the social graces are not to be i~nored. Junior Week gives to all an opportunity of entering into the social festivities, and, at their close, of returning to college work v .. -ith 3. tlevl.- enthnsiastn and zeal.

This was not done, but the op portui1ity for an association in Syracu.se is so goed that it is hoped one will be fornled. next year. Mr. \iVtn. ].
