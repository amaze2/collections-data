IM SiS£+ The death of this n1 uch-esteem·ed and popular professor occurred on June 18 at his home on College hill and was a shock to everyone. It : catTle as a very painful piece of news to the students who had just left for' their vacations and his loss will be especially ·felt by them for he was always their friend. The memory of , his life and character will ever live and be a blessing to all those who knew hitn. His death was due to what is technically known as angina pectoris, an affection of the heart. Maurice Perkins was born in New London, Conn., in 1835. lie prepared for Yale college at East I-Iatnpton, Mass., but was prevented frorn pursuing his course by failing health, and by his physician was ordered to take a lengthy sea voyage. l-Ie complied by taking a voyage around the world. After his return he attended school in New York city and finally spent three years at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. In I859 he went to Germany and attended the universities of Brunswick, Gottingen, Heidlel~ berg and Tubingen. On his return he was appointed assistant professor at the College of · Physicians and Surgeons of New York. He . went fro1n there to Harvard college and became · assistant to Dr. Gibbs of the Lawrence Scientific school. In 1865 he was elected professor of chemistry at Union college, and subsequently also professor of chemistry in the- Albany Medical college.. In 1876 that chair was divided and he retained that of chemical philosophy and organic chemistry. He received from Harvard the degree of A. M. in r865. In the course of his career at Union, honors and responsibilities had been heaped upon him . In I88o he was made a member of the city Board of Health and soon after was made also a member .of the State Board of Health. Then he successively became fellow of the American Association for the Advancetnent of Science; of the Albany Institute ; the Connecticut Academy ;the An1ericanAcademy; the Natural His tory Society of New York, and the Society of Chernical Industry, of England. He was :also the author of a book entitled, '' A Cours~ in Analytic\! Chetnistry\ and was a frequent :Contributor to medical journals. He was a member of both iJ} B K and 2 A. His activity was by no means confined to his professional duties in the college. He was known aU over this section of the state as a toxologica I expert and authority, and was frequently called on to analyze and test in cases of suspected poisoning. He was connected with over forty cases of legal chen1istry. He also had the honor of representing the New York State Board of Health in the inter- national convention of the respective boards of this continent in the City of J\1exico. Prof. Perkins was always a great favorite on the hill. His genial, unselfish disposition won for him friends wherever he went, and more than three decades of Union \boys\ will learn with deep regret of his den1ise, 1,hough past the thr .. ee-score tnark, he was just as much of a boy as ever and always took an active interest in the students and their undertakings. Prof. Perkins had the faculty of seeing the cornic side of tl1ings and he never missed an opportunity for a laugh. Many are the stories or happen- ings in the \ lab,\ and the good-hearted pro- fessor was usually the central personage. Prof. Perkins was a man who took a keen delight in doing favors and no one was ever more ready to forgive an in ju.1y. In point of service Prof. Perkins was one of the two oldest professors on the hill, he having come to Union in 1865, the same year that Dr. Wells located here. He has thus been a familiar figure on the campus and at commence- ments for nearly forty years, and his presence will be sadly missed.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. There was a large attendance of friends, in• cluding the m,e m bers of the faculity of Union university at the funeral services which were held in the college ,chapel. There was a brief funeral service at the house, at which Rev. Dr. George Alexander, Union, '66, of New York and Rev. A. ;Russell Stevenson officiated. Tl1e remains were conveyed to the college plot in Vale cemetery, at the conclusion of the services, and interred. The pall bearers were the Messrs. E. J. Wheeler, '85, E. P. McKeefe, '98, E. C. \Valker, J. N. VanDerveer, '99, Howard Wright, '95, and Prof. Howard Opdyke. The honorary bearers were l-Ion. J. S. Landon, Dr. S. B. Ward, '82, of Albany, Dr. W. G. Tucker, '82, of Albany, Dr. W. L. Pierson, '68, Dr. B. H. Ripton, '8o, H. C. Lewis, J. E. Sague, and J. K. Paige, '65. The funeral sermon in the chapel was delivered by Rev. Dr. A. V. V. Raymond. Dr. Perkins is survived by Mrs. Perkins, two daughters, Miss Alice of New York, and Mrs. Everett Hale, jr., of this city, and one son, Dr. Roger Perkins of Cleveland, Ohio. ** *MM = ¥JMMI?M HENRY WHITEHORNE, LL. D. • Henry Whitehorne, LL. D., professor of · Greek in Union college, died at his home on the College hill at about three o'clock on Sunday afternoon, Septernber 29. Doctor Whitehorne wa·s horn on the Island of Jamaica, January 6, r8r4. Doctor White- horne's father who owned an extensive indigo plantation in the Maroon 1nountains, died this sa1ne year. His widow, after having settled the affairs of her estate, removed to England to educate her children. Her son Henry was placed in the famous public school at Shrews- bury and spent his early school days there. Afterward he was prepared for Oxford under the instruction of the Rev. Mr. Binghatn, a clergytnan of the Church of England. Dr. Whitehorne entered W~H::}am. college in 1833 and was graduated in t837. · He was in Oxford therefore during the · f'&inous Oxford movetnent. Benjamin Parsons Symons, leader ofthe Evengelical party in the university, was at tl1at time Warden of Wadham college, and Wadham was the ce.ntre and principal meeting place of the broad church faction. These then were years of great intellectual activity at Wad- ham, always a scholarly college, distinguished earHer as the birthplace of The Royal Society and later as the alma mater of Frederic Harrison, Dr. Congreve and other noted English positivists. Dr. Whitehorne made the most of the scholarly. opportunities of his college. He was further• more pron1inent in athletics, for he was a member of the 'varsity crew. Shortly after leaving Oxford, Dr. White horne came to Canada, and from Canada in 1841 to New York city. In 1845 and I 846 he taught Greek .and Latin at St. Thomas Hall, a church school situated at Holly Springs in the Protestant Episcopal diocese of Mis~issippi and from 1847 to 1852 he was principal of the school. From 1852 until r857 he conducted a private school in :~Memphis, Tennessee, and in r857, he was a F, called to the professorship of Greek in the ~University of Mississippi. He continued as ·professor of Greek and librarian of the university until r86r. At the outbreak of the Civil War not being in sympathy with the Southern cause, Dr. White- horne was compelled to leave the South. In- deed, his leaving was so abrupt that he was forced to abandon his house and all his house- hold effects including a large and valuable classi- cal library. At Columbus, Ohio, he was re- fused passport through the Confederate lines by Gen. Leonidas Polk, his bishop in Mississippi, and he therefore decided to go to Richmond to present his petition in person to his friend Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confedracy. President Davis granted him a passpo1t, and he c~me to New York by way of Washington. Doctor Whitehorne had been well· nigh im- poverished by his sudden flight from the South and his subsequent journey Nortp under circum- stances of peculiar difficulty. For two years he was obliged to support himself and his family by turning his hand to whatever he might find to do. Among other thing he was war cor- respondent for a Russian new spa per.

} ' '~ ' I .'\i 1: · .. ' . I ,, \- In 1863 Dr. Whiteho1·ne was made principal by the. Union Classical Institute of Schenectady, at that time under the management of the . Trustees of Union College. In 1868 he wa:s made professor of Greek in Union College, suc- ceeding Dr. Taylor Lewis, and continued in that position up to the time of his death, teach- ing until his last illness with unabated force and ability. Dr. Whitehorne ~as dean of the college from 1886 until 1894, and during the first two years of his deanship many of the duties of president of the college devolved upon him, there being an interim in the presidential office. Ll'he degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on DocJQr Whitehorne at the commencement of (!_887.- .. Alumni who were present on the occasion ;n.ay · resonably doubt if ever any degree was ·con- ferred amid such hearty and deafening applause. From r891 until 1896 Dr. White horne was president of the New York Alpha of Phi Beta l{appa. Dr. Whitehorne was_ married in 1845 to Matilda Watts Cooper, daughter of George Duncan and Elizabeth Bayard Cooper of New York City. He is survived by three sons and two daughters, Dr. H. B. Whitehorne of Verona,. N.J., Dr. E. E. Whitehorne of Chicago, Mr. Bayard Whitehorne of Montclair, N. J., and Miss Kate and Miss Edith Whitehorne of Sche- nectady. Mrs. Whitehorne died in March, r888. ALBANY LAW SCHOOL OPENS. General Parker in His Address Tells of McKinley as a Student There. The Albany Law School entered upon its fifty-first year on September 25 under auspicious circutnstances, the number of students being more than double that of other years. The majority of the members of the faculty, the board of trustees and the members of the classes were all present and the usual addresses were made. General Amasa J. Parker college, '63., as president of the Board of Trustees, rnade the address. In part he said : 7 \The semi-centennial year of this school, which closed on the 29th of May last, was an eminently successful one in many ways, notably the very large classes in attendance, 1naki ng a total exceeding that o.f any one of the 30 years preceeding, and the hearty reunion of hundreds of our alutnni of the 50 years' life of the school, cotning frotn all portions of our country, among them two men of protninei.ce in the law, who were members of the first class of 185 r. \This reunion was productive of much good and promi5ed well for the future of the school. \The reorganization of the Albany Law School Alurnni Association at that titne, last 1Ylay, was most gratifying and the large work of preparing a comprehensive catalogue of all graduates of the school to date., is now in rapid progress toward cotnpletion under the in11nediate supervision of A. Page Smith, secretary of the ahnnni, 51 State street, .Albany, N. Y., and to whon1 great credit should be given for this work. \ But all has not been sunshine for us! ~'Early in August, with but a few hours' warning, was called to his eternal rest, Prof. James W. Eaton, a trustee of the faculty. He had been since the reorganization of the trustees and faculty, six years since, one of the 1nost valuable and active factors in our work here. He was by nature a teacher and w.as rated as the equal of any la'Y lecturer in this country or in England. He was a 1nan of liberal education and his reading covered tnany and various sub- jects of great interest and value. He was an ex- ceptionally interesting and able man and in his short life accon1plished a large and lasting work. The subjects upon which he le~tured here were among the 1nost important in the sehool and the best provision possible will be tnade in the near future for the lectures formerly delivered by Prof. Eaton to be delivered by others as will he announced by the dean at the proper time. \ The other sad subject I have to refer to to- day is the dastardly assassination of our most distinguished alutnnus, President Willian1 Mc- Kinley. ''It was my privilege to have known him personally frotn the titne he catne to Albany in the late fall or early winter of 1866.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. \ I had graduated in the class of 1864 and be- gan the practice of my profession here, in this city, a:s the partner of my father, one of the founders and professors in the Albany Lavv School, on the first of May, I 865. \ The class that Mr. McKinley belonged to was known as ' the war class' and it is claitned that every grade in the arn1y from tnajor-general down to private was represented in that excep- tionally large class. ''At that time and for years previous and sub- sequent thereto, the Law School occupied the building which is now the south wing of the Albany Medical College, and the entrance to the same was on Jay street. \Mr. McKinley, according to the records, boarded at a house just above the Law School, on the south side of the street, known as number 40 Jay street. ''From the very first he attracted much at- tention in the class on the part of the three pro- fessors. He was impressive, and yet very quiet and modest, and inspired great respect and con- fidence in whatever he did or undertook. He studied with extraordinary care and diligence and was particularly noticed on the rigid ex- aminations held in those days by the three pro- fessors, as well as in the Moot Courts. \ I kept track of him princtpally through tny father down to the time of his death, in May, 1890, and he studied Mr. McKinley's career with great interest, having predicted a tnost dis- tinguished future for hirn shortly after he entered our school. \ In after years I saw Mr. McKinley frotn ti.rne to time and had his personal promise, since ·he becatne President, of delivering the annual address to the graduating class of this school, and which, had he lived, would no doubt have been fulfilled in May, 1902, or 1903. \ We have a strong and peculiar interest in the life and record of our great alumnus, William Mci<.inley, who passed so itnportant a year in his life in this city and in our honored institu- tion. \ He conspicuously typified the American character and was representative of all that is best in life, tnentally, morally and physically. ''In character he was exact and progressive, diligent in all work which feU to his lot, Jiberal and tolerant,-in short, a Christian gentleman. \If only he could have ·addressed us and ex- pressed his views and appreciation of that year here in the Albany Law School, how thankful we all would have been. \' But God has ordained otherwise and, bow- ing to the mandate, let us fully appreciate and ernulate those high qualities we clain1 such a vested interest in.'' At the conclusion of General Parker's address Andrew V. V. Rayn1ond, president of Union University, delivered a very interesting address. He referred feelingly to the death of J atnes W. Eaton and President McKinley. He told the students that McKinley's life was one that should be copied by every true Christian and patriotic citizen. The school was draped in rrlotuning in respect of the tnemory of Mr. McKinley and Mr. Eaton. 'Their portraits on the platform were draped. :ht1r. Eaton's chair also was draped. Among graduates from the college who are students in the Law School are: Bender, Read, Fenton, Paige, Pike, Hubbard, Boorn and Rogers, all of 1900 and Merrin1an and Minkin of 1901. MEDICAL :OPENING. The .t-\lbany Medical College opened for the season of 1901 and I 902 on Sept. 25 at noon. The metnbers of the freshman class and the students who have attended the college for one, two or three years assetnbled in the amphitheater, where the introductory lecture was given by Dr. Howard Van Rensselaer, professor of materia medica and therapentics. Dr. Van Rensselaer's lecture was especially for the bene- fit of the young men who .are about to take up the study of surgery and medicine. He en- deavored to in1press upon the students the difficulty that will be experienced during their college life and gave some good advice as to the best course to pursue in order to be successful to a high degree on the day of their graduation.

This important event to the sophomores and freshn1en occurred this year on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 25. It consisted ·in the throwing of the usual amount of salt and decayed vegetables and the pitching of the cane aloft followed by a wild rush.

OuR advertisers will please notice their printed n1atter and send any corrections to the manager at once. Unless such action is taken, it must be taken..for granted that the work is entirely satis- factory. THE editors wish to state that owing to the quantity of material for this ·week's number they propose to make the next issue a speciale Mmorial number to the many prominent men who have recently passed away and who were so intimately connected with Union. THE students will please note that the paper is sent to them _without soliciting their subscriptions. It is expected that every student will show his loyalty and appreciation of the labor expended on the paper by becoming a subscriber. The man- agement purposes to see all the students person• ally within a short time and in the meantime it makes the request that they do not stop the paper. IT is customary in the first number of this paper to offer some word of welcome to the returned stu- dents and especially to the tnembers of the incom- ing class. Owing to the unavoidable lateness at which the paper appears no word of welcome is needed. The Concordiensis only wishes that the members of 1905 may learn to become loyal and true sons of Old Union, and to uphold in every way the interests of the college of which they have now become a part. THE alumni will please note the change in the management of the Concordiensis. If any may have complaints against the former management, it is suggested that they be sent to the former management. The present manager purposes to placein the the hands of the alumni, weekly, a paper which will keep them informed on all matters of interest connected with the college and asks, in return, some material recognition in the shape of subscriptions. If they have been subscribers, it is asked that they do not get out of touch with the life and spirit of their Alma Mater as she is to-day by stopping the paper. UNION has been peculiarly unfortunate during the past three months in having lost two of the oldest and most highly esteetned men on its faculty, its treasurer, and some its famous alumni. First came the unexpected death of a man known and beloved by all Union men, Dr. Perkins; then the death of the well known journalist and art-critic, William J. Stillman, '48; then the death of Bishop Littlejohn of Long Island, of the elass of '45. Soon after occurred the death of that loyal son of Union and veteran-general, Daniel Butterfield. A few days before college opened came the death of Treasurer Gilbert K. Harroun, whose removal was indeed a serious loss to the college. Next ·'' .. ,! .,

Mr. McKinley was a graduate of the Law department and had an LL. D. conferred upon him last June at the fiftieth anniversary exercises of the school. And lastly, that wound, freshest in the tninds and hearts of all-the death of Dr. Henry White- horne, on September 27. NEW STUDENTS.

The professorship in chemistry, which was rnade vacant by the death of Dr. Perkins last June, has been filled by the appointrnent .of Dr. Richard S. Curtis. Dr. Curtis has enjoyed extensive Q.pportunities both for study and practical experience as a teacher of chemistry and comes to Union with an established reputa- tion. He was graduated from Yale in the class of '88. Frorn r888 to 1890 he was employed as chemist at the Connecticut Agricultural Station ; from r 890 to T 892 he studied at the Universit!es of Munich and Wuerzberg, from which latter institution he took the degree of Ph. D. After taking his degree Dr. Curtis studied for a year at the Sorbonne, Paris. Frotn r893 to r897 he was employed as instructor at the University of Chicago and fron1 1897 to the pre·sent time he has held the professorship in chemistry at Hobart College. The resignation of Albert H. Pepper, A. M., assistant professor of modern languages took

12 THE CONCO·RDIENSIS. place in June. His position has been filled by the appointtnent of Frederick H. Wilkens, A. B., Johns Hopkins, '84, and Ph. D., University of I.Jeipsic, '91. After taking his degree at Leip&ic Dr. Wilkens was for several years an honorary fellow at Johns Hopkins. Then he spent about a year in Gennany pursuing research., work. He came to Union from. Cornell where, as an honorary fellow he had some of the ad- vanced work in Gern1an. Mr. Frederick Edwards_, C. E., has been :ap- po·inted instructor in surveying, drawing and mathematics, vice Lindsay Duncan resigned. Mr. Ed\vards graduated from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute vv·ith the class of '95 and had been up to the titne of his appointtnent at Union, engaged as engineer. in the Brooklyn Navy yard. He is a junior member of the An1erican Society of Engineers. Assistant Professor J?:oward Opdyke is on a two years' leave of absence in Europe. His work in the departtnent of physics during that time will he taken by Mr. E. B. Wheeler, B. S., a graduate of the University of Missouri in '99· Mr. Wheeler cotnes to Union from the State Normal School at Cape Girardeau, Miss- ouri, where he was professor of physics. NORTHFIELD. Last summer witnessed the first eflorts of Mr. Moody's successor, Rev. G. Can1pbell Morgan of England to carry on the work began by Mr. Moody at the ian1ous Northfield conference. Mr. Morgan gave several addresses at the con- ference as also did Robert E. Speer and John R. Mott. Mr. Morgan is a different sort of a man from Mr. Moody, more educated, but un- doubtedly he is fitted to be at the head ot these world-famed conferences. This year's Student Conference was one of the most successful ever held, 699 delegates be- ing present, 592 of whotn came fro1n the United States and Canada. There were 149 institu- tions of learning represented and delegates from 29 different countries, among whom was the Crown Prince of Korea. Japan had her dele- gate and a bronzed man in turban and linen duster spoke for caste-cursed India ; and even once-powerful Portugal had a delegate who pleaded most earnestly for help in the work· The greatest occasion at Northfield is the Fourth of July celebration. It is .an event which will always remain i~n the metnory of those who have , been fortunate enough to be present. The exercises begin in the afternoon and extend al- m·ost without interruption (save supper) until midnight. 'The first features on the progratn are the field and track events. While no world's records are broken, still there is throughout a spirit of intense rivalry. This year, Yale as usual, won the greatest number of points. After supper the delegations, separately and by states, n1ake their way to the auditoriutn where a monster meeting is held. 1,his building is especially fitted for increasing the volume of college yells, and if there is any need of added incentive in this line, it is furnished by the presence of delegates from so many other insti- tutions. After the address of the evening, this year being delivered by Hon. Seth Low, presi- dent of Columbia, who spoke on '' Responsi- bilities of the Coliege Man to the State,\ each college of sufficient size is allowed, in ils turn, to give the college yell and to sing one of its college songs. The evening is cornpleted by an enorn1ous bonfire. Union was represented at Northfield during the past summer by six rnen, Hannay, South, 1902; Pearce,· 1903; Beadle, Brown, Green, I90f. Y. M. C. A. NOTES. The annual President's reception to new students occurred in Silliman Hall on the even- ing of Sept. 20. An address of welcome was. made by President Crain, followed by speeches by Manager Woolworth and Captain Mallery of the football tean1 and Manager Yates of the Musical Association. The first vesper service was held in Silliman Hall on Sept. 22. Opening prayer was tnade by Dr. A. Russell Stevenson of First Presby- terian church, after which President Raymond gave a talk. The second, on Sept. zgth, was lead by Dr. Zelie of the First Reformed church. The third service, on Oct. 6, was conducted by President Raymond. i· I .

THE CONO'ORDIENSIS. 13 UNION BEAT LAUREATE. Opening of the Football Season. Union opened its footba H season on Sept. 28 with a game on the cam pus with the strong eleven of the Laureates., which resufted in a victory for Union by the score of 6 to 5,. There was a very large attendance to witness the , struggle. The Laureate team outweighed Union's eleven by about twenty pounds, but the effective training of Coach \Bill\ Smith, showed itself. The Laureate's touchdown was n1ade in the first half by an end play by Phil l}raper who, supported by good interference, which prevented Cronkhite and MaHery from tackling him, ran seventy-five yards for a touch- down. Draper failed to kick goal. Union's touchdown was made in the second half by repeated end plays and line bucks. In the second half Draper kicked ofl and the ball went out of bounds. Draper licked off again to Hawkes, who made twenty yards before downed by Clute. Mallery tnade thirty- five yards through the Lau1·eate's left end. Union advanced the ball to Laureate's seven yard line when time was called. Score at end of second half, Union 6, Laureates 5· The 1 ine-u p : Union. Positions. Laureates. Thebo .............

Union showed its good football material to the Trojans on Oct. 5 by defeating the R. P. I. on their own grounds by the decisive score of 17 to o, although the Garnet eleven did not have any practice during the first three days of the week. Although the R. P. I. had the ball but once in Union's territory, nevertheless the Insti- tute ele\Ten played a desperate defensive gatne. R. P. I., though visibly outpointed, put up a worthy struggle and even called into the game in the second half their crack centre and right guard, Gridley and Stevenson respectively, who '\tvere on the sick list, to try and stem the tide, ~ but to no avail,-the Garnet kept pounding their line and running around their ends for re- peated gains. C. Sn1ith and Pitz, the half backs made some tackles, the former being in the contest every minute. R. P. I.'s ends did not show up as well for Union's loose inter- ference ran around them time and time again. Considerable gains were n1ade through her line, as the line was lighter than the Union. Mallery and Gulnac did the tnost ground gain- ing for the Garnet. Thebo played a good gatne at end, R. P. I. tried to buck it. Collier made sotne fine tackles, throwing C. Smith back· twice for a yard's loss each time. Paige put up a strong game on the offensive. Twice when the ball was within a few feet of the R. P. I. goal he was given the pig-skin to buck the line for the coveted touchdo'vvn and each titne he did it successfully. Cronkhite put up a good game at quarterback. Anderson and Patton played the first half and in the second half they were replaced by Cronkhite and Hawkes. FIRST HALF. Union won the toss up and chose to defend the north-west goal. Burgoyne kicked off to Union's 15 yard line. Paige punted to Fergu- son, who was downed in his tracks by Bryan. Anderson fell on the ball when dropped by Ferguson, but was tackled before he could tnake

I.'s three yard line. Paige was then given the ball and by a plunge through the line carried the baH over the line for a touchdown, after eight n1inutes• play. Burgoyne kicked off to Gnlnac on Union's twenty-five yard line, who advanced the ball five yards when downed by C. Smith. Mallery went around left end for twenty yards. Gulnac circled right end for ten yards. Mallery made five and ten yards around about M. Srnith. Gulnac then made two gains, one of four yards through right guard and one of six yard around the right end. Paige plunged through between the left guard and centre for five yards gain. Mallery and Gulnac by a three and' four yards gain brought the ball toR. P. I.'s one yard line, when Paige was given the ball for his usual daring buck for a touchdown. Paige ki~cked goal. On the line-up Burgoyne kicked to Union's thirty yard line and Worth fell on the ball. R. P. I. lost the ball on downs. It was then that Collier made his two brilliant tackles, throvv·ing Pitz both times for a yard's loss. Mallery made a gain of four yards through left tackle when titTle was called. Score, Union r 1 ; R. P. I. o. SECOND HALF. In the second half Union had the south-east goal to defend. Paige kicked off to R. P. I.'s fifteen yard line. Union obtained the ball on a fumble.

THE ·CONCORDIENSIS. 15 UNION, 35; HOBA:QT, 0. The Garnet Wins Its First League Game. Union won her first league game .of the sea- son on the gridiron last Monday afternoon by defeating the Hobart eleven by the score of 35 to o. The game was an easy victory for the Union eleven frotn beginning to end. 'The ball was in Hobart's territory du1·ing the entire game and only once did the visitors n1ake their five yards. Hobart had the ball but four times -when Paige kicked off in the beginning of the first half, when Paige punted to Hobart's forty yard line, when Finegan after running twenty yards dropped the· ball when tackled, Warner falling on the ball, and in the second half the ball was awarded the visitors, Finegan having been ofl:side. rrhe fin;t touchdown was made after two minutes of play, 1~heho running· twenty-five yards around left end for ·a touchdown. This was the only goal that Paige failed to kick. Warner then kicked off to Cronkhite, who returned the ball twenty-five yards, then by successive end plays and line bucks the ball was brought down the field and Gulnac vvas sent around right end for another touchdown. Warner kicked off to Shaw who made ten yards when downed and then Paige punted. The visitors here made their five yards but were soon forced to punt. The ball was advanced to the centre of the field by short end plays, when Cronkhite went through right tackle for a touchdown. Warner then kicked ofr to Cronkhite who advanced the ball to the centre of the field, Thebo made three yards around left end and then Mallery made a fifty- two yards run around left end for another touch- down. On the next kick-ofr Union advanced the ball to I-Iobart's twenty-yards line, when Paige circled the left end for a touchdown. In the second half the visitors put up a better de- fensive game than they did in the first half and the Garnet scored but one touchdown. Warner kicked off to Shaw. The ball was advanced steadily, Patton tnaldng a thirty yards run around right end to Hobart's two yards line. Gulnac was then pushed over for a touchdown. Every man on the Union eleven took a con- spicuous part in the game and played his po- sition excellently. Union had no difficulty in making their fhye ya1~ds. Foley, Hutton, War- ner and Maddigan played a good game for Hobart, tnaking son1e fine tackles. The line-up and sunnnary: Union. Positions. Hobart. Thebo ............... Left End .........

It is probably needless to say that the coach cotnrnittee has re-engaged \Bill\ Stnith '99 for coach. And it is also needless to say that their action meets with the rnost hearty appro.val of the whole student body. ''Bill's\ fcuniliar face is seen every day on the cat11pns and his pres- ence is positive assura nee that Union's teatn will surpass the tean1s of colleges of her class. Already there are three victories to her credit. The outlook is very bright. With the ex- ception of three men-Fenton, Carver and Oln1- sted-all of last year's team are back and will play. Fenton has graduated, Carver vvill be unable to play on account of too tnuch work and Olmsted because of a recent surgical opera- tion. Fenton's place will be very thoroughly filled by Bryan of Auburn who has entered the Law school. Bryan is a player of large ability and experience and is well known to Union tnen and to the football world. He played left gua1 4 d on Union's '99 team and tnade a great record at that titne

16 ------ADVERTISEMENTS.-- .. Carver, captain of the 1900 team, will be sorely missed and it is no easy matter to find his match behind the line both as a ground gainer and as a vigorous defensive player. Olmsted's place at right end presents the greatest difficulty to the coach as no one has yet appeared in col- lege \vho is as satisfactory an end as played there last year. T'he candidates for right end at present are Patton of 'o5 and Hawkes, 'oz. Gri:~wold's return to college last Wednesday has relieved all doubts as to the center of the line. He is in fairly good condition and is expected to rapidly get into shape. Collier will probably again fill the position of right guard. Raym,ond is also a strong candidate for the middle of the line. As to Finnegan and Shaw at tackle, left and right respectively, cotnlnent is unnecessary. It is sufficient to say that they will be there. Behind the line Paige wiJl fill the full- back's place. His gan1e seen1s to be fully up to the standard he has set himself in former years. In the Laureate garne he had no trouble in plunging through the center. l-Ie punts as well or better than ever. Captain Mallery will play left-half and Gul- nac right. Mulvaney is also being tried at half- back and gives pron1ise of becoming a good man. At quarter there are four candidates- Cronkhite, Anderson, Sherrill and E. King,'os. Of these present indications are n1ost favorable to Cronkhite or Anderson. Their work is about on a par and definite statements cannot be made at present. Both men are light but for their weight are strong players. Other likely candidates are Becker, 'os, for the line, and I-Ioltnes, 'os, behind the line. The team has been greatly handicapped so far this season by unavoidable interruptions to the practice caused by suspension of college exer- cises. The team has been unable at any one titne to have several consecutive days of good practice. But frotn now on practice will be rushed as 1nuch as is consistent with keeping the men in proper condition. One thing which will be of assistance and absolutely essential is a large scrub every day. Any man who cares for football should present hitnself for practice every afternoon. This ap- plies especially to freshmen who n1ay not a:s yet know their capabilities ot1 the gridiron. 'The fact that the managetnent has a1Tanged a ga1ne for the second eleven in Johnstown for the 12th of the n1onth ought to act as an additional in- cerltive for m:en to try £or places on the scrub. There is still plenty of roou1 for good material,. and the sent b will be a warded with several little trips during the season. rrbe fol1owiHg is the corrected schedule of the 'varsity.

I l ·i I The Concordie11sis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 17, 1901. No. 2. DR. PEQKINS' FUNE~AL. .-' Impressive Service in the Chapel Con- ducted by Dr. :Qaymond. The funeral sern1on of Dr. Maurice Perkins in the chapel was preached by the Rev. Dr .. A. V. V. Raymond on June 20. \ We are all mourners today, for a con1mon sorrow has drawn us together. He was our friend and now that he has gone ouy hearts are heavy. So suddenly was he taken from us that we do not yet realize that the kindly voice is stilled forever. He touched our lives in so many different ways that it is not for any one of · us to voice the experience of another. Each brings today his own tribute of affection. More worthy than anything that I may say is the silent testitnony which fills this place with the fragrance of grateful and cherished metnories. H If I speak rather than another, it is because .j of the relationship which he sustained in this college. This was the scene of his life work. Here he came in young manhood, with the tt·aining of the best schools in this and foreign lands, cultured and vigorous, \rith inherited gifts and graces, with the spirit and the convic- tion of ~ncestors who had led in the making of America, with a person~lity of rare charm, and here he labored through all the long years until now he rests. Fittingly have we borne his body to this college chapel. Fittingly also are we to bear hence for bnrial to the place already marked by the graves of many who spent their lives in the service of this college. I may not dwell upon the distinction which he gained in his chosen calling, the wide recognition .which he won for technical knowledge and professional ability. All this is of motnent, but it does not tell the story of his life, nor reveal the secret of our affectionate regard for his memory; for above the professor was always the man. What he was counted for 1nore than what he knew, or what he taught, important as that was., and he was always in the classroom, as everywhere else~ the sympathetic, generous helpful friend. That is why he won the confidence of the stu- dents and came into such close and intimate re- lations with thetn. Instinctively they felt and trusted his kindness. The story of his life in Union College will never be told until all the men have spoken who received from him a needed word of warning, of advice, of en- couragement. He was not easily deceived. Few men could see tnore clearly into the heart of things, and it was characteristic of the man that he found the heart of good in things evil., and so he believed in men when others did not, and, while censuring, could forgive'J and while rebuking, encourage. We of the faculty know how often he became the advocate of a student subject to dicipline, ~'Let me talk to him,\ he would say; and we knew that when he talked there would be no abatement of right and just demands, but withal the tenderness and syanpathy of a father. '' What he was to the men in college he was to multitudes beside. His great fund of infor- mation upon many subjects, his flashing wit, his human interest tnade him welcotne everywhere. He attracted men and men attracted him. His circle of acquaintances was always growing. What he said was remembered and quoted. He added to every company and graced every occasion, and always he was the sanle-broad- minded, generous hearted. He was alert to do a kindness. When opportunity offered gracious words catne naturally to his lips. His sympathies were essentially detnocratic. They went out to men of all classes. lie wept with them andre- joiced with them. All suffering touched hhn ; all nobility moved him. He was always telling of something worthy in others. 'Isn't that fine,' he would say, and often his eyes would moisten and his voice would choke with feeling.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. \If he was essentially democratic in his sympathies he was essentially unworldly in his purposes and his aims. The things that men usually covet he ignored. He was not always seeking his own advancement. He appreciated it, but he appreciated other things more, and so he was content to live the life of a college pro- fessor, rejoicing in his work, doing good as he had opportunity, without envy, without covet- ousness, without malice, pure-minded, single- hearted, loving and beloved, and now he has gone to his reward and his works do follow hitn. His life was his religion and as we think of that life we recall the words, ' Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this ; To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world.' '' Dear professor and dear friend : You did not live in vain. You made the world brighter and our lives richer, and today in our sorrow we thank God that he gave you to this old college and to us.\ FUNERAL OF DR. WHITEHORNE. PQESIDENT RAYMOND DELIVERS A MOST MEMORABLE ADDRESS. Procession Follows the Body to the Grave. The funeral of Dr. Henry Whitehorn, the be- loved Greek professor of Union College, was held with tnarked solemnity on Oct. 2, at 4 o'clock. No instructor of \Old Union\ has ever been more revered than \ this grand old man\ and the numbers in attendance at the obsequies gave proof of their deep esteem. At 3 :30 a private service was held within the home in South college, the Rev. Pierre McD. Bleecker, rector of Christ church conducting the solemn service. At its cotnpletion, the casket conveyed by the student bearers, F. T. Ostrander, 'oz, G. S. Woolworth, 'oz, G. W. Donnan, 'o3, Eustace Hulsapple, 'o3, C. L. Hays, 'o4, and J. F. Putnam, '04, followed by the honorary pall bearers from the different departments, Dr. William Wells, Dr. S. G. Ashmore, Dr. James R. 'Truax, Dr. Thomas W. Wright, Dr. F. S. Hoffn1an,. Dean B. H. Ripton, Prof. 0. H. Landreth, Dr.· James H. Stoller, Dr. E. E. Hale and Dr. Curtis, proceeded slow I y frotn the house to the chapel passing between a file of undergraduates standing with bowed heads, on either side of the walk along the colonnade. Within the chapel the beautiful anemone and maple ·leaves from Jackson's garden were d,is- played in profusion. Other floral tributes con- sisted of a handsome bronze oak wreath with purple asters tied with broad purple ribbons, a gift of the students, a second wreath of autumn leaves and flowers, presented by the faculty, a mass of roses, a profusion of palms and many other handsorne pieces. The Rervices opened with a selection from the college choir and at its conclusion a fervent prayer was offered by the Rev. Mr. Bleecker followed by the address by President Raymond who spoke thus: '' What can I say that will fittingly voice the gratitude and affection and sorrow that stirs our hearts today. No t\ribute of words can equal that which is borne by the tnetnories that cotne thronging upon us in this hour, tnemories of a great soul, of a gracious spirit, of a life that spent itself in loyal and loving service. Rather than speak I would let these metnories tell their silent story to the praise of him we honored and loved. And I know well tliat this would best meet his wishes, who while living shrank fron1 public honors, but found his satisfactio_n in the consciousness of duty done and that he had a place in the grateful recollections of generations of Union College students. All that he would ask of us today is that we should think kindly of him and not praise him in speech, and yet if he knew that talking over what he was, and how he lived, for us and for others, would clear our vision and bring a new and better purpose into our lives, I think that he would not protest, only he would say, ' Speak the truth about tne.

If we can only give him that we shall be content, but we, not he, must detennine what is due, for like all large souls he did not appreciate hitnself, did not 1·ealize how much there was in his character and work deserving of the highest praise. '' It 1nay be doubted if anywhere else in America there was such a complete reproduc- tion of the spirit and methods and aims of higher education in England as was found in the Greek roo1n of Union College while Dr. Whitehorne was in the chair. His personality prevaded the the place and dotninated it. He was emphatic- ally the n1aster, absolute in his authority, exact- ing in his dernands and persistent in his ideals- the master of his subject as well, as accurate in his knowledge as he was comtnanding in his spirit. And like every great master he was a great servant. What he knew he knew for others, and lived only to communicate his knowledge. He had no an1bition beyond that. To him a professorship was a place of honor, of the highest honor. This also was a part of his old world inheritance and so he magnified his office. \ But if his classroom was the centre of his world it was not his whole world. He knew Greek and much beside, for he \rvas warm- blooded and lived in the nineteeLth century and in Ameriea, in touch with the life about hin1. He&hared its hopes and aspirations and struggles, and ·what seen1ed to sotne of us strange, espec- ially in his later years, he never lost his sympathy with youth. This more than anything else bound his students to hirn. He did not simply endure them, but enjoyed them. He could laugh at them and with them. Their interests were his interests, their triumphs his triurnphs. Their noisy exuberance did not disturb him. Their sport did not annoy him, only let them beware not to transgress the bounds of respect, nor abuse confidence. That was intolerable and youth was no excuse. His whole nature re- volted against duplicity and tneanness. He de- tnanded frotn others what he gave so freely to thetn, courtesy and fair play, and yet he was charitable in his judgements and never con- demned unless proof of .guilt was too positive to be rejected. Even then he leaned to mercy's side and was always willing to give an offender another chance. Most men grow cynical as they grow older but he did not, and so he was an optimist to the last~ believing good rather than evil of others. This made his old age beautiful and inspiring. It was a joy to tnet him. The metnory of an interview would 'live in the n1ind for days like the rich perfu n1e of a flower, not so much because of what he said, al- though that was ahvays worth recalling, but be- cause of the subtile influence of his generous, kindly, hopeful and unselfish spirit. His very manner suggested the union of strength and gentleness, which gave such chann to his personality, and then that wonderful voice would linger like the deep tone of a cathedral bell, pervasive and compelling. \I have not attempted to review in detail the life of Dr. Whitehorne, although in its earlier years it was fuU. of incident and exceptional interest. That story will be told in another way. Nor have I touched upon the tender and sacred relations of the home, which his love en- riched and blessed. Too deep for words is the sorrow of those who remain. and even our sytnpathy for thetn, sincere and deep, n.1ust re- tnain unvoiced. It has seemed most fitting at this time to speak of Dr. Whitehorne as we knew him and of the life that he shared with us. Meagre and unworthy have been my words. Our real tribute is in our hearts where his name is enshrined and his influence abides. For us he cannot die~ but will live in the worthier pur- poses which he has inspired, in the beauty and fragrance of the tnernory that he has lefr. I have not said too rnuch. I could not say too much to express the gratitude and love with which we treasure his tnetnory and still treasure it until we 1neet again in the fellowship and ser- vice that has no end.\ At 4 :30 the procession tnoved frotn the chapel.

THERE is an old custom here at Union which the members of the freshmen class either through igno- rance or design do not observe. That is the cus- tom of speaking to every other student wherever one meets him, either on the campus or down town, whether one knows his nan1e or not. In a college the size of Union and possessing the democratic spirit that she does, it ill becomes any student to fail to recognize with a friendly greeting any fel- low student. OWING to the early date at which the paper went to press it will be impossible to give a de- tailed account of the Cornell game until the next issue. The Cornell Daily Sun in an account of the game says in part : ''Two touchdowns were made in either half, all of which were pluckily contested by the Schenec- tady eleven. The line-bucking of Paige, without headgear, was conspicuous. Captain Mallery played well at left half and the work of Cronkhite in getting into every play brought him also com- mendation.

In his handsome country residence at Cold Spring, overlooking the Hudson, directly op- posite West Point, General Daniel Butterfield passed away on July 18. Six weeks before his death the general sustained a stroke of apopl.exy in New York, fron1 which he never recovere:d. The week before his death he gave directions to his wife to obtain permission from the Secre- tary of State to have his body interred in the n1ilitary cemetery at West Point. At first it \Vas thought permission could not be granted, but later word came that it had and on receiving the news the feeble n1an gave a smile of satis- faction. Gen. Daniel Butterfield was a type of the true American in the best and highest sense of the term. In the first place he came of good stock. His grandfather was born in Albany and lived on the great estate owned by one of the Van Rensselaer patroons. His father, John Butterfield, was one of the class of men who illustrate ·the pluck and ability which win suc·· cess and prove sterling character. John Butter- field posessed indomitable will, conspicuous ability and the intelligence which is far-seeing and finds expression in enterprises that are enduring and ever-increasing in scope. He was a pioneer in the transportation business and helped to develop it from the crude n1ethods of the stage coach to those of the lightning express of the present day. In 1849 he formed the express company of Butterfield,. Wasson & Co., which becatne a very itnportant factor in the trade of this state and the West. Later he originated the American Express Company, and was its directing power until his death at Utica in r869. He was also quick to see the importance of the electric telegraph, and built the Morse line between New York and Buffalo. As president of the Overland Stage Con1pany he, in r868, before the building of the transcon- tinental railroads, contracted with the govern- ment to carry a tri-weekly mail between San Francisco and the Missouri river. Utica, his home for many years, largely benefitted by his enterprise, public spirit and sagacity, and he was one of the leading me,n in promoting its interests and maintaining its prosperity. Thus it will be seen that the son inherited qualities that were certain to bring him success and distinction. Daniel Butterfield was born in Utica, October 31, r831. His father, who had been deprived of educational advantages in his early years, made provision for the thorough training of the son. Daniel received the best preparatory schooling and entered Union College where he graduated in 1849, being a member of the Sigma Phi Society. For years he was general superintendent of the eastern division of the American Express Company, and took a protninent place in the affairs of the tnetropolis. When the Twelfth Regiment of the state militia was reorganized in 1859 he was chosen its colonel, and his efforts soon brought it to the front rank among the New York troops. Col. Butterfield, early on the breaking out of the civil war, tendered his services to the general government, and April 21, 186I, with him at its head, it left for Washington. Col. Butter- field's command led the advance into Virginia across the Long Bridge in July, marched to the upper Patomac and the young colonel was placed in command of a brigade. He show~d great capacity for military cotn- mand and before the end of the first year of the war was made Lieutenant Colonel in the Regular Army, and then Brigadier General of V olun- teers. In I 862 he was appointed a Colonel in the Regular Army and a Major General of Volunteers. General Butterfield served under McClellan with the Arn1y of the Potomac and commanded the Fifth Army Corps at Fredericks- burg. He was Chief of Staff at Chancellors- ville and Gettysburg. He fought with great bravery all through the peninsular catnpaign of r862, taking a prominent part in the battles of Hanover Court House, Mechanicsville and Gaines' Mills. In the latter action he was seriously wounded. But he continued in the field and was intrusted with important and deli- cate duties. He participated in the constant

12 'THE CONOORDIENSIS. fighting during McClellan's retreat to Harrison's Landing, and commanded a detachm·ent which protected the rear and flank of the Union artily. Gen. Butterfield vvas sent across the J an1es river with his cotntnand to cover the withdrawal of McClellan's army from the Chickahominy. In August and Septen1ber, 1862, he was with the Army of the Potomac in its fier.ce batHes under Pope and McClellan and was given cotn- mand of a division. November 29 he was ap- pointed a tnajor general of volunteers and July 1, 1863, a colonel in the regular anny and com- n1ander of the Fifth Infantry. At the bloodly battle of Fredericksburg he cotntnanded the Fifth Corps. Thereafter his services were in constant den1and by his superiors, who appre- ciated his value as a comtnander and adviser. He was chief of staff of the Army of the Potomac at Chancellorsville and also at Gettysburg, and his bravery and capacity won for mim repeated and tnost co1n plim{~ntary official allusions. He was again wounded at Gettysburg, but would not remain long disabled, and in October he was tnade chief of staff of the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps, sent to the relief of Rosecrans' army at Chattanooga and with Gen. Hooker · took a leading part in the operations about Ch~1ttanooga and the famous \ battle above the clouds\ on Lookout tnountain. With Hooker, too, he went through the contests at Mission Ridge, Ringgold and Pea Vine Creek, Ga. In the Atlanta campaign he con11nanded a division of the Twentieth Corps in the battles of Buz- zard's Roost, Resaca, Dallas, Ne\v Hope Church, Kenesaw and Lost Mountain, and for gallant and meritorious conduct was given the brevets successively of brigadier and major general in the regular army. For some years after the close of the war Gen. Butterfield was in charge of the general re- cruiting service of the United States forces stationed about New York harbor. In 1869, .l1aving been appointed as the head of the sub- treasury in New York, he resigned from the army, in order to assun1e the important duties of the position. He was one of the tnost re- spected and influential residents of New York city. With such a record of long and gallant ser- vice, Gen. Butterfield was naturally called into protninence whenever the veterans assembled. 1\'here are many events of this kind to be chronicl,ed, and among the pleasantest and rnost impressive was the reunion of the Third Brigade, first division, Fifth Army Corps, Army of the Poton1ac, at Washington Septetnber zr, 1892. This was during the national encampm~ent of the Grand Arrny of the Republic, a memorial tneeting of the union heroes. The proceedings at the reunion are published in a very handson1e volum·e, and its perusal affords a great deal of most interesting and instructive information which has an in1portant bearing on the history of the war. The brigade association was organized at St a tar Island, Mich., August 5, 1891, and the reunion of the following year at Washington was its first annual gathering. The history ofthe Third Brigade is one of the highest honor and most exalted bravery. It was com- posed of the Eighty-third Pennsylvania, Six- teenth Michigan, Forty-fourth New Yo1·k and Twentieth Maine regiments, and out of a total enrolltnent of 6,943 it lost 3,012 in killed and wounded. In the list of greatest losses during the war, including over ro,ooo regiments, the Eighty-third Pennsylvania is second and the Sixteenth Michigan eighth. The mjnutes of the first meeting of the asso- ciation records these among other notable facts: \In our gathering today vve have sotne pride in the fact that we belonged to a brigade that fired the first gun at Yorktown and the very last at Appon~attox. Through its lines can1e the flag of truce, signifying the surrender of the army of Northern Virginia, and to this brigade was ac- corded the honor of receiving the guns and colors of the soldiers who followed Lee to Appomattox.\ Gen. Butterfield was the first comtnander of this hard fighting brigade, and he led it through the peninsula campaign, from Yorktown to Richmond, and from Hanover Court House to Malvern Hill, and until July 13, r862-a period en1bracing son1e of the bloodiest conflicts of the war. The story of the brigade is one of valor unsurpassed, and Gen. Butter- field, as president of the association, gave elo- .I i i l

.I J I ~ r: ,, ~ . ji ' i i l THE CONCORDIENSIS. 13 quent and tender expression to his sentiments in his address on the occasion referred to. Another volume of peculiar interest in this connection is the one containing the report of the annual reunion and dinner of the Old Guard Association of the 12th Regiment, N. G. S. N. Y., Saturday, April 21, 1894, at the Manhattan Athletic Club. It is particularly rich in illustra- tions, among which are fine protraits of Gen. Butterfield and other officers of the regiment in its earlier and later days, war scenes, the present armory and many fac·similes and views that are connected with the regiment's history. r.rhere are also biographical sketches of Gen. Butterfield, Gen. Francis C. Barlow and a no- table array of other officers who have served at the head of the regiment or in other capacities. The reunion of the Old Guard in 1894 was a n1emorial occnsion. Gen. Butterfield was presi- dent and as toasbnaster dwelt on the patriotism which is at the bottom of the National Guard, and gave a very feeling review of the I 2th Regi- ment's history and a touching tribute to its gallant dead. ,Col. Richard Henry Savage, the author of \ My Official Wife\ and other stories, is a graduate of \Vest Point and a soldier of dis- tincion. l-Ie spoke at the reunion to the toast of \ The Citizen Soldier,'' and paid a high compli- ment to the volunteers and the National Guard. In the course of his ren1arks he said : ''To lead her sons in war, to marshal her hosts, a state which can alone place an army of several corps in the field, needs the higher n1ilitary talents. New York has not been dis- appointed in her hours of need. Your gallant ex-colonel, now major general, Daniel Butter- field, seen1s to have taken our proud state tnotto as his watchword- ... ' Excelsior' has been his guiding principle. The multiplication of col- leges with n1ilitary instruction, the extension of the Natioual Guard system and the growing nun1bers of West Point graduates foster military studies today. We have a mass of technical publications; our bureaus of military informa- tion, our attaches abroad, the discussions of the veteran orders and the adjutant general's state archives furnish to the student ample material. But it was singular that the man who reached the highest honors of New York in the regul~r army should have fitted hitnself alone for the field. The sudden outbreak of the war found Daniel Butterfield in the flush of young tnan- hood. It was the strategy of peace which aided Daniel Butterfield in perfecting his latent military talents. A born leader of tn·en, cool, energetic, decisive, with a ready eloquence and a never-failing wit, he was certainly well fitted to organize tnen. This career, which has since rounded into a cosmopolitan fame as scholar, thinker, orator and man of high affairs, was interrupted by the war at which our wiseacres sneered.\ Gen. Butterfield was a gentletuan of ripe culture and conspicuous literary attainn1ents. His first publisheu work was produced during the exciting period of the war, a book entitled \Camp and Outpost Duty,\ dealing with ex- periences at the front. Since then he has written and spoken tnuch on important and interesting subjects. Very warm in his heart is the place held by his Ahna Mater, Union College, and in one respect his service to it has been as unique as it has proved effective and practical having served as trustee for a long num- ber of years. It is safe to say that the Butterfield lectures, as a. means of giving the students ex- positions by protninent tnen of practical ques- tions of the highest value to then1 in their future careers, have no equal in college work. They are the gift of Gen. Butterfield to the institution which cotnmands so much of his love and pride. The idea originated at a meeting of Union alumni in New York city some years ago, and was very enthusiastically received. Gen. Butterfield at once proceeded to put it into exe- cution. The labor of securing lecturers and arranging dates for their appoarance at the college was enonnous, and no one with less en- thusiasm and courage and well-matured purpose than Gen. Butterfield could have carried the project through. But he did so, and Union College has been enriched by the valuable in- formation itnparted to its students by the eminent tnen who have brought the store of their knowledge and experience, and out of their abundance provided most valuable instruction to

14 THE OONC,ORDIENSIS. those whose good fortune it has been to hear thetn. The course has been one of the most remark- able in its originality and practical value that coHege n1en of the present age have known any- thing of. Every college man, every college student and every graduate will thoroughly ap- preciate the merit and importance of this work. At the 32d annual reunion of the Society. of the Anny of the Poton1ac, held in Utica last May, a tablet was presented to the Onetda Historical Society by the 12th Regirnent Veteran Association. The presentation was made by Gen. Horatio C. l{ing and the tablet was accepted by Judge Alfred C. Coxe, president of the Oneida Historical Society, and is now on the east wall of the Munson-Williatns Memorial. It is a replica of a bronze tablet placed on the regiment n1onument at Little Round Top at qettysburg by the 12th and 44th New York volunteers. It contains a bas-relief of Gen. Butterfield and the following brief account of his n1ilitary career: \Maj. Gen. Butterfield. Wounded three days' battle at Gettysburg. Chief of Staff, Army of the Pototnac.

Butterfield was twice married. His first wife was a Miss Brown of New York, whom he married before the war. A few years ago he 1narried Mrs. Julia James of New York, who survives. He leaves no children. Gen. Butterfied leaves a brother, John Butterfield, and a sister, Mrs. Williatn M. Storrs, both of Utica. '95.-Albert S.

D., professor of Old and New Testament criticisn1 and exegesis of Auburn Theological Seminary, died in Auburn, July 14. He was born in Columbus, N. Y., June 25, 1813. He was graduated from Union College in 1832. For a tin1e he engaged in teaching, tneanwhile taking a private theological cotH~se in Schenec- tady. In 1837 he was ordained by the Albany Presbytery and was installed as pastor of the Third Presbyterian church of Albany. There he re~ained until I 8 55. . In 1847, fourteen years after his graduation frotn college, he received from Colutnbia College the degree of doctor of divinity, and in 1883 the additional degree of LL. D. ·was given hin1 by Lafayette College, In 1854 he was called to accept the professorship in Auburn Theological Setninary. In 1892, at the age of eighty years, Dr. Hunt- ington retired from active work, becoming pro- fessor emeritus. He went to the serninarv at a \' titne when its affairs were at a low ebb. Its paesent high standing among the reHgious educatioual institutions of the country is largely due to Dr. Huntington's energy and tireless work. He vvas twice married. On July 13, 1839, he married Miss Anna Euphemia Van Vechten of Schenectady, who died in 186o. On April 16, 1868, he married her sister, Miss Katherine Van Vechten, who survives hitn. Four children also survive, Chester Huntington of Flushing, L. I.; Samuel V. Huntington of New York city; Mrs. Dana W. Bigelow ·of Utica, and Mrs. John Gilchrist of Boston. Dr. Horace Bigelow of New York city, is a grand- son. WILLIAM J. STILLMAN, '48.

' \ THE CONCORDIENSIS. 15 a fondness for art, he began studying landscape painting alrnost as soon as he left college with Frederick E. Church. In 1849 he made his first trip to Europe, became acquainted with Ruskin and Rossetti and returned in six n1onths a disciple of the pre-Raphrelite school of art. Fron1 1851 to 1859 he devoted himself to art, ,contributing regularly to the National Academy of Design, to vvhich he was elected a metnber in 1854· During this titne he became greatly interested in the cause of free Hungary, largely through the eloquence of Louis Kossuth. Kossuth; before he fled frotn Hungary and ?ur- ing the Hungarian revolution, had becorne possessed of the Austrian crown jewels and hid tbem in Vienna. lie suggested to Stilhnan that the latter should visit Vienna, try to get the jewels and bring thetn to America. Stilhnan readily undertook this perilous mission, failed to accon1 plish it and returned to the United States in 1855· Shortly afterward he and John Durand founded The Crayon, a paper devoted to art and art criticism. From the founding of the Craxon Mr. Stilhnan gradually abandoned creative art for criticistn and general literature. He became the intimate friend of Lowell and Agassiz and Emerson and what has come to be known as the '' Adirondack Group\ of literary tnen and naturalists. In r859 he went to Europe again and in 186r he was appointed United States consul at Rome. He was re- tnoved fron1 that office and made consul to Crete, owing he always said, to his criticism of the An1erican legislation at Rome. He re· n'lai'ned our consul at Crete until r869, when he became persona non grata to the Turkish governnJent, owing to his avowed sytnpathy with the Cretan insurrection, and was retired. He never afterwards held public office. Soon after his removal as consul at Crete he became a rnen1.ber of the staff of the London Tio1es and was a pensioner of that paper at the time of his death. In r886 he was the Rome correspondent of that paper, and for several years afterward he prosecuted his studies in archreology. About a year ago appeared a very interesting book written by hitn entitled \The Autobiography of a Journalist.\ AB~AM N. LITTLEJOHN, '45. The Right Rev. Abram Newkirk Littlejohn, bishop of Long Island, died at Williamstown, Mass., August 3· He was born in Florida, Montgon1ery County, N. Y., Decen1ber 13, 1824. 1.\'he celebration of his seventy-sixth birthday last Decetnber in Garden City, L. I., where his home is located, was attended by nTany of the clergy of Long Island and the n1,etropolitan district. On January 26, 1869, he vvas con~ecrated bishop of Long Island in Holy Trinity church, Brooklyn, of which be had previously been rector. The consecration ceretnony was per- formed by Bishop Potter, assisted by Bishops Johns, Odenheimer, Coxe, Clarkson, Randall, Kerfoot, Neely and Mooris. The year before he had been elected bishop of central New r\\ ork, but this office he resigned. Bishop Littlejohn vvas graduated from Union College in I 845 and ordained deacon in St. Peter's church, Auburn, March 19, 1848. For a short period he was in charge of St. Ann's church, Amsterdatn, and then moved to Meriden, Conn., where he took charge of St. Andrew's church. In f 850 he becat\lle rector of Christ church, Springfield, Mass., and in June of the following year he was called to the rector- ship of St. Paul's church, New Haven. In 1858 he was elected president of Geneva, now Hobart college, but declined the honor. During his pastorate in New Haven he was lecturer on pastoral theology in Berkeley Divinity school, Middletown, Conn. In r86o he tnoved to Brooklyn and on Easter Sunday of that year began his duties as rector of the Church of Holy Trinity. Bishop Littlejohn in 1874 \Vas placed in charge of the American Episcopal churches in Europe and consecrated St. Paul's- \iV.ithin-the- Walls in Rome and opened the An1erican church in Paris. While abroad he delivered a course of lectures before the University of Catnbridge, and the university conferred upon bim in 188o the de- gree of doctor of laws. Bishop Littlejohn was a rigorous churchtnan and sternly opposed all innovations, particularly the new forms in the accessories of worship. Because of these ancl his willingness to voice bluntly and in public his intolerance of the methods in some churches he aroused the opposition of not a few clergymen. He was the author of many works, a tnong the best known being \Discourses on Individualism,\ '' Christian Dogma Essential\ and \ The Christian Ministry at the Close of the Nineteenth Century.\

16 --ADVERTISEMENTS.-- UNION'S TREASURER DEAD. Gilbert K. Harroun, treasurer of Union col- lege, died in Plattsburg on September I z, frotn heart di&ease.

There are some lives that seen to us so fu'll and strong that \Ve can scarcely think of them as ceasing to exist, and when death comes to such the blow is heavy ~ nd the sense of loss is deep, because the shock is great that life., so all- abounding and exuberant, should cease. And so it was that a wide circle of friends heard witll astonishment and unfeigned sorrow a few days since that Professor Perkins was no more. That the kindly voice should be hushed ; the willing hands, ever ready to extend favors, be stilled ; and the record of a life, helpful, en- thusiastic and inspiring, so suddenly be closed, seetned all but hnpossible, and brought dismay and grief to many. It is too early now, and the sense of loss too recent, to gather up with systematic c~re the facts of such a life, and to arrange them adequately and in a fitting form, but many friends whom this memorial tnay reach will look for sotne record of the life just ended, and so such is the brief sketch offered in the hope that it n1ay serve a present purpose and aid in voicing the sorrow which all feel who knew and loved our friend. * * * * * As a teacher Dr. Perkins was etninently suc- cessful. By winning the affection and securing the regard and confidence of his pupils he easily enlisted their attention, and, being stitnulated by his enthusiasm and encouraged by his kindly intetest, they made rapid progress under his guidance. Among tbetn he was universally popular. His students confided in him, trusted and respected him. His laboratory was a place in which they loved to gather, to discuss with him their work, ask his counsel, and unfold to him their plans, and here they were ever sure of , kindly reception and disinterested advice. His personality was so winning and his manner so easy and confidential that the moit difficult student was quickly at ease in his presence, and his genial nature, ready wit and quick repartee made all his conversation enlivening and his pleasantries irresistible. His keen sense of hutnor prevented his taking too serious a view of the daily incidents of life and largely ac- counted for the refreshing influence which he exerted so universally upon all with whotn he came into even casual contact. He looked for the best in everybody and was quick to com- mend good deeds and noble actions, and while he was not slow to recognize foibles and incon- sistences, if he exposed thern it was with playful ridicule and never with malice or vehement de- nunciation. Such geniality and bonhomie as he possessed is attractive to all, but especially to the young, themselves enthusiastic and ligbt- hearted, and so it was not strange that his classes as they went out of his tutelage carried with them a deep feeling of affectionate regard and sincere attachment. As a chemist Professor Perkins' reputation was widely extended and his services were frequently sought. He received his professional education at a titne when specialties were little cultivated and when chemists were expected to hold themselves in readiness to undertake any and all kinds of work, and so, throughout his long professional life, he carried on work in all departments of analytical chetnistry, inorganic . and organic, gas analysis, metallurgical chem- istry, soils and fertilizers, milk, any dairy pt·o- ducts and other foods, potable and mineral waters, dye-stuffs and explosives, drugs and tnedicinal preparations. He showed no dis- position to work in a groove, but was ever on the lookout for new methods and improvements on old processes, and as he was a quick reader, possessed a retentive n1emory, and was always ready to test any method that promised to be

6 THE CONCORDlENSIS. helpful, he easily kept abreast of younger men, carrying into his mature life and later years the energy and self-confidence of youth. He was of . too versatile a 1nind and too impatient of results to indulge in protracted research work, pre- ferring to essay many things rather than delve laboriously into any one, but he was in1bued with the true scientific spirit, and all the work he did was honest work, well done and never slighted. His duties left him little titne for writing but his lecture notes were freshly and carefully prepared each year and whatever he wrote was concisely expressed and clearly stated. Witness his address delivered at the opening of the fall session of the Albany Medic~l College, Septetnber 5, 1871, which was pub- lished by the class and ranks among the .most eloquent and suggestive lectures of its kind ever delivered in the institution. His analys',is of human parotid saliva made while assistant at the College of Physicians and Surgeons has a p- peared in the text of every edition of Dalton's Treatise on H u1nan Physiology subsequently published, and no analysis of this secretion so cotn plete had ever previonsly been made. In r867 he prepared and published for the use of his laborartory classes \ An Elementary Manual of Q.ualititave Chemical Analysis,\ a small work, based upon Fresenius' hand-book, but possessing certain original features, which was very favorably received and largely used in other institutions. r.rhis book, expanded by otl1ers into a larger ntanual and under a different name, is still in common use and a favorite with many teachers. His'~ 1\tletric Systetn of Weights and Measures,\ was published in tabulated form for the use of the students of the Albany Medical College in r878 and proved very helpful to them and was widely circulated. In 1878 he read before the Medical Society of the State of NewYorka paper on the\ Estimation ofUrea,\ in which he described an ingenious application of the hypobromite method of Kopp, and the process recommended by him in this paper has, in one form or another., con1e into general use among physicians. This paper appeared in the Transactions of the society for 1878, at p. 142, and has been issued as a reprint and had a wide circulation. As a toxicological expert Dr. Perkins rendered valuable services in many important cases·. Upon the stand he was not easily .discomposed, nor did be unnecessarily antagonize the interests .of the opposition, and as he never failed to show proper courtesy to judge, jury and counsel, he made a good witness and served as such in not less than forty medico-legal cases. For several years· l~e was a member of the Schenectady Board ()f Health, and from 1887 to 1892 was one of the State Health Commissioners upon the State Board of Health by appointment of the Governor, and in 1892 he represented the Board at the International Convention of Health Boards l1eld at the City of Mexico. He was elected to ·membership in the American Asso- ciation for the advancement of Science in r866, and was a fellow of the association fron1 1875 to 1884. In r 875 he was elected a corresponding member of the Albany Institute. He was a tnem ber of the Medical Society of the County of Schenectady frotn 1872, and served as a delegate from that society to the State Medical Society from 1881 to 1884. He was, at various times, tnember of the American Acaden1y of Arts and Science~; the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences; the Natural History Society of New York; the Albany Camera Club ; the An1erican Chemical Society, and the New York Section of the Society of Chemical Industry of England. He vvas a 1nember of the Phi Beta ICappa and Sig1na Xi. Dr. Perkins had traveled extensively and had stored up a rich fund of experiences gained dur- ing his journeyings and toreign residence. He had studied in Gennany and France ; traveled in the far East; sailed the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. and China Sea, and had passed tht·ough tnan_) 7 thrilling experiences and some hairbreadth escapes, which he occasionally related for the entertainment of his. friends. lie was a good traveler, spoke several languages, was at home anyvvhere, and being naturally of an observing disposition he profited much by what he saw. He cared little for externals, nothing for display and attached no importance to fast ships or fine surroundings if so be he got to his destination and attended to the matters in hand. And this . ' t ' ' ' '

i : t ' ' THE CONC:ORDIENSIS. 7 ten1per of ,mind marked aU his acts. He liked the elegancies of life and its luxuries and con- veniences well enough but these things were not in any sense essential to his comfort or happi- ness. He was easily satisfied, and seldom un- satisfied or dissatisfied with his surroundings and fortunes. He thought too highly of himself to envy anybody else or covet their possessions. He tnade his lot in life ; and while he liked people, and enjoyed society, he was by no tneans dependent upon it for his pleasures, but found thetn everywhere at hand, because he took delight in little things, looked cheerfully upon life and had a kindly feeling toward all n1ankind. Dr. Perki.ns married a daughter of the late Dr. Potts, a distinguished clergytnan, and his family consisted of two daughters and a son, all of whon1 survive him. His daughter Alice resides in New York city, and Rose married I)r. Edward Everett Hal:e. Jr., professor in Union College, and to .their son has been given his grandfather's name. His son, Dr. Roger Griswold Perkins is located in Cleveland. His residence in Schenectady fronted on the beauti- ful college catnpus and fanned part of one of the old college buildings. It was old-fashioned, but quaint and very comfortable, and he loved it. Here was his study, and here were his books and amid these pleasant and quiet sur- roundings, with his fan1ily and intimate friends,. his happiest hours were spent. This sketch would be incotnplete without some 1·eference to Dr. Perkins' personal appear- ance and characteristics. He was a singularly handsome tnan of distinguished appearance, rather careless and unconventional in dre$S, bt1t of a tnanner and bearing that attracted attention anywhere. In conversation he was anin1ated and fluent ; a good story teller and quick to see the humerous side of any situation. He was of a bright and sunny disposition, sanguine and affectionate ~n temperament, looking for the best in ever body and every thing and thinking no evil. He was quick to see into the heart of things and not easily deceived by outward shows or mere pretenses, and although both sympathic and unsuspicious by nature, he was quick to detect hypocrisy.. affection and in- sincerity, and to expose and ridicule them if need there was. It has been said that he was fond of people, and people liked him, for he was democratic in his tastes and friendly with every one :he met, greeting all acquaintances with a pleasant word or cordial hand-grasp, and ready at any time for a chat with a friend, or a bit of helpful counsel or suggestive hint, tersely or quaintly expressed perhaps, for some. younger tnan. His conversation. was embellished with many odd words, droll expressions and pro- verbial phrases, and he was the life of any gathering and a center of observation wherever he went. His students adtnired hin1 ; his col- . leagues loved him; and his seniors esteetned him. His friends were n1any,-of enemies he had none. Dr. Perkins' last illness was of short duration. During the fall he had complained occasionally ot shortness of breath, but he had been in good spirits and sten1i ngly in his usnal health. In lvfay a physical exatnination revealed an ab- normal action of the heart, and it wns found later that other organs were involved. He. kept up and at his work, but his friends noted a change in his appearance, and during Coin- mencement week, the week preceding his death, he showed little disposition to take an active part in any of the exercises, although greeting those friends whom he met with his accustotned cordiality. On Monday afternoon, June 17, he was suddenly siezed with an attact of violent pain in the region of the heart. His tuedical advisers were summoned and administered re1nedies that alleviated his distress after a titne, but the next tnorning at half past one, June r8, 1901, the end came suddenly. His wife was at his side, but before the physician who, was in a lower room, could reach him he passed away. * * * * * And so has passed fron1 earth one who did much that was good as he had opportunity, and who will be long remetnbered for his ld ndly ways and gentle deeds, his cheering helpfulness, his brilliaGt mind and genial disposition. But the better part of his character,

a THE CONCORDIENSIS. ''That best portion of a good man's life, His little, na,meless, unremembered acts Of kindness and of love, '' can never be set down in words. These con- stitute a legacy bequeathed, though with no formal testament, to friends, but valued all the more because they form an inheritance so per- sonal that its items can neither be inventoried by the owner nor bestowed by hi n1 upon another. Such poss~ssions .are intangible, but they are real : invisible, but invaluable.

TucKER, '82. GULIAN LANSING. Gulian Lansing, a member of the sophomore class, died at the Ellis Hospital at 2 P. M. on Saturday morning, October 19, from peritonitis caused by an operation for appendicitis. He had been ill but a few days and his death was a shock to his many friends both on the hill and in the city. Gulian Lansing was a graduate of the Union Classical Institute in the class of I 900 and entered Union College with the class of 1904, taking one of the prize scholarships at entrance. He was taking the latin-scientific course in college and was one of the brightest n1en in his class. He was very popular among his classmates to whotn his death has caused the greatest sorrow as well as to the college generally. He played right half back on his class football team during the games last fall. He was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. The funeral was held at I 1 :30 A. M. on ~ion­ day frotn the residence of his grandparents on State street, the student body and faculty being present. Rev. J. Sheridan Zelie conducted the exercises, assisted by President Raymond. There were many floral pieces a.ent by friends, a large design· in roses being sent by his class- mates. Dr. Raymond announced in chapel that all college exercises would he on1itted after 10 o'clock for Monday. At the college meeting President Yates ap- pointed a con1mittee to draw up suitable resolu- tions and immediately after the sophomore class held .a meeting for the sarne purpose. The resolutions are as follows: Whereas, our kind Father in His infinite wisdom has removed from our tnidst our esteemed friend, John Gulian Lansing, therefore RESOLVED, That in his death we, the students of Union College, lose one who has, by his goodness of heart and congenial activities in aU branches of college life, created for hin1self a a monument of esteetn in our hearts, and RESOLVED, That as a n1ark of respect to the memory of our college mate, we extend our sympathy to his bereaved relatives, and RESOLVED, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the relatives of our deceased fi·iend and also published in the Concordiensis. THEODORE DE L. CoFFIN, MoREY C. CoLLIER, FRANKLIN H. DREES, Committee. We, the class of nineteen hundred 'and four, wish to emphasize the resolutions adopted by the student body out of respect to the tnemory of our deeply n1ourned classmate, appending this post-script as a further acknowledgen1ent of our este~m for hitn and grief over his death.

The party of fifteen players with coach and tnanager left the city on Friday, October I I, and arrived in Ithaca that evening. The team went at once to the New Ithaca where it was quartered. Saturday morning light single practice was held on Percy field. At three o'clock the garne was called. Cornell kicked off to Patton who advanced seven yards. After two downs Union punted. Cornell took the ball and by alternating plays through either tackle carried the ball across the line for the first touchdown. Goal was kicked. The second touchdown was hotly contested for ten minutes. Finucane returned the kick- off twenty yards. Coffin punted, and Union re- turned the ball with a loss. Several exchanges of punts follovved here, to neither side's ad- vantage. With the ball on Cornell's fifty yard line, Purcell broke through for fifty yards, but was recalled by Mr. Lang, who penalized Cor- nell ten yards for off-side play. The backs hamtnered the ball to Union's two yard line. Here Union held, and punted. One minute of straight play, however, rushed the ball down the field again and over the line. At the opening of the second half, Union's kick-off was returned ten yards. Soon Union got the ball on a punt and Mallery circled l'aussig's end for eighteen yards. Paige struck the line for three yards n1ore, and for eight more through Leuder a moment later. Three successive fumbles however, lost the ball. Punts were exchanged, Coffin being out- kicked. Cronkhite of Union muffed the ball on one of the punts., and was tackled by Tat,ssig who then fell on the ball himself within ten yards of Union's goal. It took Cornell five line plays to push the ball over for the third touch-down. After the next kick-off Cornell punted to Union. Union was unable to gain and punted to Cornell's thirty-five yard line within a foot of hounds. Purcell took the b~ll and circling Thebo's end ran seventy yards to within five yards of Union's goal. Cornell soon pushed the ball over. The baH was again kicked off and two or three plays were made before tim.e was called. Line-up.: Cornell-24. Positions. Union..;O.

Twenty-four to nothing is hardly a true conl- parison of the ,merits of the two tean1s. Cornell won by &uperior \vork her two first touchdowns but the two touchdowns in the last half were due not so much to Cornell's good work as to Union's vet·y conspicuous lapses. Shortly after the opening of the second half Union got the ball and had carried it about seventy yards at the rate of about five or six yards a down when three fumbles in succession lost the ball for Union and destroyed a seeming good chance to score. The two touchdowns made this half were not made by any apparent superiority on the part of Cornell. Indeed, as for straight football Union fully held her own with Cornell. Uuion was little if any out-weighed by her opponents. She was lighter at quarter but fully as heavy in the line. Cornell's backs instead of being swifter were slower in getting started than Union's. Ho\vever Cornell's backs ran well together and interfered fully as well as Union's. Cornell showed a superiority in her sure handling of the ball-no fumbles were credited to Cornell. Paige easily excelled in line buck- ing and punting. Cornell's best gains were made by cross tackle plays through Union's tackles. '63.-Rev. D. N. Vanderveer of Greenport, N.

MANAGER GRIFFITH of the Tennis Association has arranged for a tennis tournament which will begin in the near future. This tournament will detern1ine the college chan1pionship and it is necessary for all contestants to enter their names at once and begin work. This branch of athletics should appeal to every man in college who has any knowledge of tennis whatever. THE Board of Editors take pleasure in appoint- ing to the Board of Associate Editors, Mr. Borden H. Mills of the class of 1903 of the Law School who will act as reporter from that department. It is the earnest desire of the present board to do all in its power to bring about a closer feeling of unity behveen the different departments of Union University and whenever possible they intend to forward this movement. THE college was grieved Saturday to learn of the death of Gulian Lansing of the class of 1904. He was popular not only with his classmates but with the whole student body. He belonged especially to Union. His grandfather, Gulian Lansing, was a Union graduate of the class of '47-as was also his father, John Gulian Lansing, of the class of '75. He won at his entrance to Union one of the prize schoolarships and gave promise of a life of usefulness and activity. UNION, 0; AMHE:QST, 0. The team left for Amherst on Tuesday after- noon, had supper at Northhampton and reached Amherst about nine o'clock. Wednesday came on bright but very wann for football. By three o'clock there was a Fimall crowd present and a few Smith girls. The field was quite soggy from a couple of days of rain, but otherwise was in good condition. All considered the game very satisfactory from Union's standpoint. Because of her close scores with both Yale and Harvard within the ten days previous Atnherst expected an easy victory. However, after play cornmenced Am- hen;t very soon changed her opinion for it at once became evident that tTnion was not there for the purpose of playing a defensive game but proposed to be the aggressive party. 1\he teams were very evenly matched arid neither side was able to score but the honors very clearly lay with Union for she had the ball· an<.l had it in Am- herst's territory fully two thirds of the first half and fully half the titne in the second half. The Amherst line was heavy but it seemed to offer no impediment to the Union backs who went through it for four and five yard gains. On the other hand few gains were made against Union's line. It might appropriately be mentioned here that Bryan was unable to take the Amherst trip at all owing to injuries which he received in practice about two weeks ago and which were aggravated in the Cornell game. To fill his place Griswold was moved to guard and Raymond played a very satisfactory game at center. '!\ ' }' ' { '. ~ .; ' ,., ,, . 1 ' . ' ' ~ 'i .,,

Taken all in all perhaps Phillips of An1herst gained on Union in exchange of punts. Union kicked off against the wind and Atn- herst being unable to gain punted. Union by end runs brought the ball well down into Amherst's territory where it was lost on downs and punted back by Amherst. Union again brought the ball well towa.rd Amherst's goal when the satne thing was repeated. Then Union by end runs of five and ten yards frequently boxing Amherts's ends, brought the l ·aH to Atnherst'.s thirty yard line where a place ki·ck for Arnherst's goal posts was tried. The kick failed to reach the goal posts and Atnherst secured the ball. Amherst punted to about Union's forty-five yard line. The half ended shortly after with Union in possession of the ball and again on her way to Atnherst's goal. Union was a little lose in her play after the intennission and for about five minutes Am- herst left the ball in Union's territory. An1herst kicked off to Patton who lost the ball to Park on Union's ten yard line. Atnhe~:st by plays through tackle advanced the ball six yards when she was held for downs. Union punted to Pierce who ran b&ck to Union's fifteen yard line. Amherst drove her plays at Union's line but they failed to penetrate and resulted in no gain. Atnherst furnbled and Union secured the ball. After a few downs Paige punted to Am- herst's twenty yard line. Wash burn on a straight pia y throngh the line ran forty yards before he was tackled by Cronkhite. Amherst was unable to ga·in further and the ball went to Union.

Colgate went to Schenectady confiqent of victory and during the first half and the first part of the second half it seemed a doubtful struggle, but in the latter part of the second half the Garnet started in to tear up the Colgate line and run around the ends and succeeded in in- creasing the score of 6 to o by n1aking . three touchdowns to 21 to o. There was a strong_ wind blowing throughout the entire gatne and it rained during the first half. Colgate played the guards back formation and hamtnered the Union line with little success. Colgate put up a desperate defensive and a strong offensive game but Union played her usual steady game and succeeded in breaking through the visitors' line and stood firn1 against Colgate's onslaughts. The first touchdown was made during the first four and one-half minutes of the play and on the first line-up. Union obtained the ball on Colgate's 45-yard line on downs and Mallery, supported by good interference, then ran around the left end for a touchdown. Cronkhite was the star. of the day on account of his brilliant runs and tackles and excellent handling of the ball. Thebo made very large gains and did some excellent tackling, being in the gan1e at every stage of it. Mallery, Gulnac and Paige made good gains for Union. Mallery did sotne excellent tackling. Shaw and Bryan played a strong gan1e at right and left guard. Brighatn and Buck were the best ground gainers for Col- gate. Srringer and Smith played a strong gan1e and made sotne excellent tackles. Paige kicked off to Colgate's 25-yard line and Colgnte by short gains advanced the ball to her 45-yard line where she lost the ball on downs. On the line-up Mallery was given the ball and made a touchdown by a run of forty-five yards around Colgate's let1 end. Paige kicked a goal. Colgate kicked offto Mallery on Union's 5-yard line. lT nion by short gains advanced the ball to her 35-yard line, where Colgate held for downs. Colgate advanced the ball to Union's

Colgate obtained the ball on downs and advanced it to her 40-yard line when forced to punt. Then Union from its 45- yard line advanced the ball to Colgate's 5-yard line, where ·Colgate obtai ned the ball on downs. Colgate punted to Cronkhite, who ran the ball back twenty yards before downed, when time vvas called. In .. the second half Colgate kicked off to Union's r5-yard line. Paige punted to Union's 30-yard line. Colgate, unable to tnake any gains, tried for a goal from field but failed. Cronkhite picked up the ball and tnade a run of twenty yards .before tackled. Union by short gains advanced the ball to Colgate's 25-yard line, when the utnpire awarded the ball to Col- gate, Union being off-side. Colgate advanced the ball to her 40-yard line where she futnbled it. Then Union by end plays and line bucks advanced the ball to Colgate's 15-yard line, where Thebo was given the ball and went around the left end for a touchdown. Colgate kicked oft to Paige~ who advanced the ball twenty yards before downed. Union advanced the ball to Colgate's 30-yard line, where Colgate got the ball on a fumble.

President Rayn1ond on Friday rhorning last gave to the students an interesting talk ·in con- nection with the great Yale bi-centennial cele .. bration in New Haven. It was his privilege to attend the n1ost inspiring portions of the services which he in part described as follows : ''This was one of the greatest of acaden1ic gatherings. surpassing in magnificence of deco- rations anything ever seen in a political cam- paign. In the city business was suspended and the whole city given over to the celebration, while the people lined the streets. T'here was not a house that did not show the celebration of a bi-centennial. drilled. The scenes represented the founding of the college, the transfer of the books to New Haven, 'Vashington's visit to the college, the execution of Nathan Hale and other representa- tions of college life long ago. And all this time the enthusiasm kept up with no disorder of any kind, nothing that offended the ear, but yet noise enough that any sophomore could desire. \ Perhaps most interesting to me was a great campus-Ineeting, a sort of out-door theatricaL A stage was erected in the center of the campus I with seats in front for a picked chorus of five hundred voices. Then came chairs for graduates and beyond then1 the raised benches began, one hundred and fifty feet ii·om the stage. \ The night was a beautiful one and I was itnpressed by the good nature and good order of the crowd-even surprised, until I overheard this remark in explanation, ' One thing we learn at Yale and that is to wait our turn.' \ The next day was the great day of the festival, when representatives from all nations gathered in the theatre and the degrees were conferred. The gathering was notable because of the character of the guests and because of the brilliant academic gowns. Nor was there any one more resplendent than our own Professor Ashmore. The representatives of the various institutions of learning \\Tere arranged in chrono- logical order, begin~ing at the stage, and any such arrangement as this always brings Union well to\\'ard the front. It is itnpossible for you to realize the impressiveness of the scene, as ~ach man arose in his place to receive his degree. The names of Secretary Hay, Seth Low and Aclrniral San1pson were greeted with especial enthusiasn1. Then President Hadley said : '' Eight or ten thousand must have been seated there before the curtain rose and they waited in the same good order for four hours. The gathering was enlivened with cheers, both class and college, and then the singing began. One class would start a familiar song and perhaps be asked to repeat it, again and again. Of these popular songs of the old days the audience seemed never to tire. '' The pictorial scenes were in charge of the College Dram·atic Association. Those who ex- p~cted ~ut indifferent acting were agreeably diSappotnted, for the students were thoroughly \ ' But one nan1e remains,' and as President Rossvelt stepped forward it was tnany minutes before he was allowed to speak. In his characteristic way he began, 'I never yet engaged in any work for the betterment of mankind but there was a Yale man at my side.' Now if anything was calculated to bring the enthusiasm to a climax it was those words.\ In closing his retnarks Dr. Rayn1ond said : \ The part that itnpressed me most was not the enthusiasm for Yale., though that in itself was great enough, but the enthusiasn1 for America. And the spontaneous and wonderful applause that the presence of our great statesmen seemed to arouse was very noticeable. It was to the representatives of the nation that the audience turned theit: plaudits again and again. Thus we see that tn the American citizen enthusiasm for his county transcends all else.\ •

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. DQ. T:QUAX ON THE KING ALF~ED CELEB~ATION. In connection with the day's work in English literature Dr. Truax took occasion to call the attention of his classes, October 28, to the signifi- cance of the King Alfred celebration and laid special stress upon the fact that King Alfred was remembered with pr.ide and gratitude because his work had been an unselfish one, directed toward the moral and intellectual as well as to the n1aterial progress of his England, and be- cause the agencies he used-the school and literature-and the truths he taught are vital still. The following article which appeared in '' The Union\ gives the tenor of his address : \ The English celebration was held in Septem her in the city of Winchester the ancient capital of England where Alfred died and was buried in October, gor. A statue by Thorny- croft was unveiled and 1nany in1portant persons participated in the exercises, among them Lord Roseberry, Frederic Harrison, Sir Henry Irving, Charles Francis Adams. \ The American celebration is under the auspices of the Society of American Authors. It began yesterday with a sermon at St. Paul's, New York and will continue today with an ex- hibition at the Lenox Library of Alfredian literature, and with addresses at educational institutions generally, and will end with a ban- quet in New York city this evening. '~Alfred is a commanding figure in English history as a warrior, a legislator, a ruler, a patron and maker of literature, and an example of Christian virtues. The heir of a kingdom which had been wrested from its lawful possessor by the Danes, he won it back by able generalship and personal bravery and established it so finnly that in his lifetime the throne of Wessex became the throne of England. The England that had once furnished a superinten-. dent of education to Charlemagne was sunk now in illiteracy. Alfred inaugurated a revival ·of learning, devoting himself to the task with a perfect passion of enthusiasm. He learned Latin when he had reached middle-age, roused the clergy frotn their torpor, compelled the nobility to put their sons to school, by precepts and example declared the importance of the in- tellectual and the moral. It tneant much for England that royalty wielded the pen as well as the sword. What was worth a king's doing was regarded as worthy of a subject's attention. It is Alfred's interest in education and literature that has revealed to us the human quality in him that wins our affectionate regard. He gathered books and learned men about himself and drew wisdoqt from them with the eagerness and the humility of a child. He translated into Anglo-Saxon the learning that w~s hidden in the language of scholarship-the Latin-and made it accessible to all of his race, '\iVith a wise and noble philanthropy. \In the process he simplified it with evident desire to popularize it to the utmost possible extent. The history of the Anglo-Saxon church, involving the story of the first native English poet, the pastoral letter of Pope Gregory, the history of the world by the Spaniard Orosius, and the philisophy of the Roman Senator Boethius, he turned frotn unfamiliar Latin into the simplest of old English. There is good ground for thinking that he converted the simple Easter annals of the monks into the further and more dignified chronicles which are the basis of English national history. '~ How lofty was the plane of his thought may be gathered from sotne of his own sentences written more than a thousand years ago : \ ~True friends are of all the goods in this world the most precious.' \'Power is never a good unless he be good who has it.' \ 'A tnan will not be the better because he had a well born father if he him~elf is naught .. The only thing which if good in noble descent is this-that it tnakes tnen ashan1ed to be worse than their elders and strive to do better than they.' \ One of the most interesting of English historical relics, testifying both to the existence of Alfred and to the state of arti&tic workman- ship of his time is known as 'King Alfred's Jewel.' It was found in his old hiding place Athelney, and is kept very securely in the new ,.,

It is so inconspicuously placed that I have known visitors to miss it al- . together, and after tnaking the entire circui~ of the roo1ns in search for it, I had to apply to the custodian for special directions before I found it myself. It is in shape like a flattened pear or fig about the size of an old fashioned brooch. It is of gold and enamel work very elaborately wrought. On one of the flat faces is the like- ness of the upper portion of a human figure with hands upon its breast, on the other flat surface is an arabesque of flowers, and the neck or stem of the jewel is shaped like an anitnal's bead, about the ritn runs the inscription ' Alfred Mec Het Gewyrca n '-a legend practically equivalent to 'Made for Alfred '-but the literal tJ·anslation makes the jewel a thing of life, ad- dressing the observer, and saying, 'Alfred gave cornmand to tnake n1e.'\ In the political contests which are being waged in this and adjacent counties, graduates of the Albany Law School are playing an un- usually prominent part. The President of the Trustees, General Amasa J. Parker, is the democratic candidate for l\1ayor of Albany. General Parker is a graduate of Union, class of 1863, and of the Law school, class of r864. His devotion to his Alma Mater is well known, and all loyal alumni of the school, irrespective of political faith, wish him good luck at election. UNION COLLEGE NIGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY CLUB. Saturday night, October z6, was Union College night at the University Club of Schen- ectady. Invitations had been extended to all the Union alumni of Schenectady and a large number responded to the invitation. A very enjoyable evening was spent and those who were not already metnbers were so favorably impressed that ten of them signed the a pplica- tion blanks for tnembership. College songs were sung by a delegation composed of Grout, Crim, Crain and Hawks, 'o2 ; Howe, '03 ; Craig, Paltner and Drees, 'o4; and Blake, 'o5. Atnong those present were President Ray- mond and Professors Wells, Truax, Hale, Jones and Towne, Alexander J. Thomson, '48, James W. Veeder, '94, Dr. J. L. Schoolcraft, '75, E. E. Kriegsman, '76, H. ]. Glen, '8r, Lee W. Case, '82, F. W. McClellan, '83, W. W. Wetnple, '86, A. H. Pepper, '87, ]. C. Yan Voast, '87, L. M. King, '88, Rev. Harry Dean, '9o, Alvah Fairlee, '93, R. F. Gilmore, ,94, Homer Strong, '96, ]. C. Cooper, '97, Carl Hammer, '98, and H. P. Dunham, IS)OO. Seymour Van Santvoord, Vice-President of the Board of Trustees, is running for Mayor of Troy on the democratic ticket, while George H. Fitts, '74, is a candidate for re-election as Sur- rogate of A1bany County on the republican ticket. Besides this, Mark Cohn, '73, is running for County Judge, Frederick W. Cameron, '82, for Surrogate, and Matthias J. Severence, Jr., '89, for City Court Judge. Although the Law School does not perhaps furnish as many men as might be to the 'varsity eleven, the number of local coaches turned out rather makes up for this deficiency. Fenton, I 902, is in charge of the Ridgefield branch of theY. M. C. A., Hickok, 1902, is coaching the Albany High School eleven, while Merritnan, 1903, and Parr, 1903, are looking out for the Albany Academy teatn. There is plenty of baseball material in the school, particularly among the juniors, and the management tnay expect to hear fro1n thetn in the spring. One of the books that is destined to take first rank among legal publications is ''Eaton on Equity,\ by the late James W. Eaton, of the Law Faculty. Tl1is work was co1npleted just prior to Mr. Eaton's death, and is said to be one of the most comprehensive treatises on the subject ever published.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. UNION, 18; Q. P. l., 0. Th.e Garnet Again Successful in Her Contest With the Institute. R. P. I. was defeated bv the Union eleven on October 26 by the score ~f 18 to o in a listless game on the campus. The game throughout was devoid of any brilliant playing on either side. Union played a poorer game on Saturday than she has played this season, which was on account of her over-confidence. R. P. I. put up a plucky game, but at no titne did she have a chance of scoring. Fumbling was frequent on both sides. The first touchdown was made in three minutes of play. The second touch- down was made in the latter part of the first half. The third touchdown was made in the first part of the second half. Smith and Mayer played a strong game, being the best ground gainers for the Institute men. Smith made some excellent tackles. Bryan put up the strongest game for Union. . Paige, Gulnac and King made the most gains for Union. Finegan made a pretty run of 25 yards, bringing the ball close to the R. P. I. goal line, and soon after Paige was sent over for the second touchdown. Union won the toss· up, and chose to defend the south goal. Mayer kicked off to Cronkhite on Union's zo-yard line, who advanced the ball I 5 yards before downed. By end runs and line bucks Union advanced the ball to R P. I.'s three-yard line, \\vhen King was sent over for a touchdown. Paige kicked a clean goal. Mayer kicked off to Cronkhite on Union's 10.,. yard line, who ad:vanced the ball twenty yards before downed. Union then advanced the ball steadily for a touchdown, when she fumbled the ball on R. P. I.'s 35-yard line. Mayer fell on the ball and ran ten yards before tackled. Then R. P. I advanced the ball mainly by end fUnS to Union's I 5-yard line, where Union held them for downs. UGion adva1.ced the ball by line bucks and end runs to R. P. I.'s five-yard. line, where Paige was given the ball and by a line buck brought it over the line for a touch- down. Paige kicked goal. Mayer kicked off to Gulnac, who advanced the leather twentv .. yards before downed. After a few gains Paige punted to R. P. I.Js 35-yard line. Ferguson caught the ball and advanced it £ve yards before tackled by Griswold, when time was called. Score at the end of the first half-· Union 1 2 • . ' ' R. P. I., o. Paige kicked off to Mayer on R. P. I.'s IO- yard line, who advan€ed the hall ten yards be- fore downed by Bryan. Smith futnbled the ball on R. P. I.'s 15-yard line. Bryan fell on the ball and advanced it six yards before downed by Pitz. King made a gain of four yards and Paige two yard through the line. King was then pushed over for a touchdown. Paige kick goal. Mayer kicked off to Paige on Union's 10 yard line, who brought the ball back ten yards before tackled. Union advanced the ball to its 45-yard line. Paige punted to Greenfield, who was tackled in his tracks by Gulnac. Bryan tackled l\tlayer for a loss of eight yards. Bonnie was also tackled by Bryan for a loss, and Greenfield tried to punt but King blocked \the punt for a loss for R. P. I. .ot twenty yards. Ferguson fell on the ball. Greenfield then punted to Cronkhite. R. P. I. obtained the ball on a fumble. The Institute n1en could make no gains aud Greenfield punted to Union's 40-yard line. King was twice tackled for a loss; Paige punted to R. P. I.'s 55-yard line. R. P. _I. advanced the ball twenty-five yards, when tlme was called. Score at end of second half-Union, 18; R. P. I,. o.

The rehearsals are well attended and the competition runs high. This may be attributed to either of two reasons. In the first place the cornpetitors for the clubs are so numerous that each man must do his very best in order to gain a position on the clubs. Then, secondly, a deposit of five dollars has been required of all candidates. For each absence a fine of twenty-five cents is imposed. The annual fall concert will take place eat·Iy in December and if training and diligent practice counts for anything this will be the tnusical event of the tenn. The 1nembers of the association are requested to arrange with the mana~er, W. S. Yates, 'oz, concerning the deposit of $5 .oo per men1ber that was voted at the £rst n1eeting of the year. All deposits tnust be made before Saturday, November 2nd. The following men are the most protnising candidates for the glee club and in all probability will compose the glee club this year: First tenors-Crirn, Grout, Harris, Hager. Second tenors-Craig, Howe, Bishop, Blake. First basses-Crain, Heath, Palmer, M. King. Second basses-Slack, Hawkes, Hinman, Molineaux. A selection form the first list was in several instan~es extremely difficult to make owing to the earnestness and ability of most of the candi- dates, and many of the men were chosen for their part in preferenc to others not for any marked puperiority of voice· but for the reason that they w·ere also protnising candidates for the instrutnenta I clubs, and it is the wish of the management, in so far as it is possible, to rnake the men \ double up,\ thus cutting down the expense of an extra man. All the candidates both successful and un- successful have shown a marked improvement over men of former year in the promptness, regularity and earnestness of their work. Harvard has an entering· class of 532 the largest in its history .

Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Ctas. Burrows, Printer, H! State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. IT is to be regretted that the Syracuse man- agement saw fit to cancel the game with Union on the campus for Saturday. The cause for such action was a misunderstanding on the part of Syracuse of the place at which the game was to be played. The contest, had it come off, would no doubt have proved to be an interesting one. The notice was received by Manager Wool- worth at such a late hour that it was Impossible for him to arrange for another for that date. THE cheering at the R. P. I. game last Satur- day was not what it might have been. There is no reason why there should not be at every game on the campus good, loud, strong, systematic cheering. It is hoped that there will be such at the Vermont game on Tuesday. The following is taken from the Willian1s Weekly and deserves the careful attention of every man in college: ''The matter of cheering at games and athletic meets is far more important than the attention given it would seem to hnply. The standard of the student body is often judged by its conduct at athletic contests, so that :if the cheering is not just what it should be the impression gained by an outsider is not apt to be a good one. Moreover this impression, though it may be false, is likely to be lasting. We are glad to note, therefore, that Williams is maintainit1g her reputation for gentle- maul iness at games. The cheering here can easily be made sufficient for all purposes and still remarn within the limits of courteous conduct.\ THE Concordiensis hereby announces the open- ing for competition for positions on the editorial board as follows: from the class of 1905 six men will be appointed as reporters,. to serve during their sophomore year; and from the class of 1904 there will be four appointtnents as associate edi- tors to hold office duri.ng their junior year. Com- petition will begin at once and the appointments, which will be made. in May, 1902, will, in every case, be made on a basis of work submitted. The attention of juniors is called to the fact that the board would like to see more men, even at this late day, enter the competition from the class of 1903 for associate editors. The attention of sophomores, in particular, is called to the fact that any mem- ber of the class may try for a position as associate editor. The mere fact that a man has \made\ the paper during his freshman year is in itself no reason why he should be retained; and the four sophomores whose worl{, as regards quality and quantity, is most satisfactory will receive the ap- pointments for next year. All students who intend to take up journalism as a profession or who are in any way interested in literary work, should avail themselves of this opportunity. For the in- formation of those contemplating trying, the editor- in-chief will state that all copy must be in his hands before Monday noon, in order to be of use for that week's issue. Those desiring to compete for any of the above positions are requested to register their names with the editor-in-chief as soon as possible. ' l : ·. [ .. ..... . •:. ~ r' .·. ., ... '.

The twenty-first session of the Albany College of Pharmany was opened auspiciously with an introductory lecture by Dr. Willis G. Tucker. In his retnarks Dr. Tucker alluded to the rapid growth of the college, reviewed its history dur- ing the past two decades and spoke· of the excellent work which has been ddne by n1any of its graduates. He stated that though costly equiptnent is advantageous it is not necessarily essential, inasmuch as much of the work was done by lectures and recitations. Concluding he gave the students the following advice as re- gards the proper division of time that should be · n1ade by a student : • \Lay out your titne systematically, and while you allot a certain proportion of it to rest and recreation, see to it that the best of your waking hours are profitably spent. A systematic division of your time, each hour having its ap- pointed task, is indispensable if you wish to ac- complish much. Pleasure should not be allowed to interfere with these self-appointed tasks. Be very sure that in such a profession as ~·ou have chosed, precision is of the utmost itnpo;tance.\ The class, which numbers nearly eighty st~dents, is as follows: Samuel Armstrong, Ptne Bush ; Frank Clayton Barrows, Canton ; Lawrence Henry Burke, Oneonta ; Gerard William Clare, Utica; Patrick Joseph Donovan, Albany; Arthur James Doran, Valley Falls ; Stephen Ernest Dorn, Johnstown; George Henry Dupont, Plattsburg; James Edward Farley, Matteawan; William John Fridav Schenectady ; Edward Augustin Gillia:s: Amsterdam ; Harry Benjamin Greenman, Jr., Cortland ; Fred Harmon, Adams Mass. · Walter William Janser, Albany; Fran~is A. Kennan, Albany; Thomas Francis Kenna, Troy; John Jacob Knauf, Albany ; James Kichard Lang- ton, Troy ; George Gorman Lenney, Potsdam ; John Alexander Livingston, Hoosick Falls . Andrew William McLoughlin, Albany; Job~ Edward McNany, Port Henry; John James Monahan, Auburn; John Kidder Oakes, Cherry VaHey; Elmer William Pepper, Schenectady; John David Sauter, Schenectady; Charles Edwin Stickles, Philmont; Richard Stephen Sullivan, Troy; Charles Stanley Tiflt, Sa'nd Lake ; Harley Edwin Wade, Cook's Corners; James \'rilliam Wallace, Schenectady ; Harley Levi Whipple, Massena ; Henry Clark Wilson, Rouse's Point; Andrew Henry Witze, Troy; Arthur Brown Young, Johnstown. GREEK LETTE:Q P:QA TEQNITIES. The following eli pping is taken from the Cornell Daily Sun and will be of interest to all college men : \A law has just passed both branches of the Arkansas legislature depriving any member of a Greek letter fraternity of the right to take any honors in the University of Arkansas. This th~ governor will doubtless sign. \ In connection with the report of such action. it is interesting to note the attitude of President Schunnan toward fraternities. He said: 'College fraternities at Cornell have become one of the strongest powers for good which the institution at present possesses. They con- tribute more to building up rnanhood and de- veloping the honesty, probity, chivalry, and . also the intellectual facilities of the students than any course of study. I have thus come to count a great deal on the fraternities in the ad- ministration of the college, and in the moulding of its life and thought. \ 4 There are not too n1any fraternities at Cor- nell. There should be a goodly number in any such institution to stimulate rivalry and ernula- tion. Fraternities have, therefore, come to be essential to out college life as is exercise to our physical life.' \-Cornell Daily Sun. The average annual expenditure of the class of 1900 at Princeton was $700. Thirty-one men worked their way through college entirely, and thirty more in part. The average age at eradu.ation was 22~ years,

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS. CO~NELL ABOLISHES QUSHES. At a special meeting ot the undergraduates of Cornell held recently to consider the subject of underclass rushes the following resolutions were adopted: Inasmuch as the so-called practice of hazing has in the past been attended with serious con- sequences and has proved derogatory to the best interests of our beloved Alma Mater, therefore be it RESOLVED, That it is the sense of this meet- ing as a whole, and of each class here repre- sented separately, that in the future, all petty and indiscriminate rushing shall be discontinued and abolished ; that henceforth each and every class and the entire student body individually, shall discountenance and suppress such practices. And further be it RosoLVED, That only one annual underclass rush shall be held; that it shall take place on the Armory Green on Hallowe'en night; that it shall be an organized rush supervised ~nd regulated by a cotntnittee of upperclasstnen ; and further that this custon1 shall be adopted as a precedent to be followed by all succeeding classes ; and furthennore be it RESOLVED, 'rhat these resolutions be printed in the University papers in the fall of each year. JUNIOQS, 11; FRESHMEN, 6. The first of the series of class football gan1es was played last 1~hursday afternoon between the juniors and freshmen, which resulted in a victory for the former by a score of r I to 6. There was a good deal of interest displayed in the gan1e as was evinced by the large number of students who occupied the side lines. The game was loose, both sides fun1bling repeatedly. The juniors had a 1nuch stronger team than the freshmen, holding the freshmen repeatedly for downs. The freshtnen kicked off to the juniot·s' fifteen- yard line. The juniors advanced the ball to the freshmen's fiv:e-yard line, when Gould was sent over £or a touchdown. The freshman kicked off to the jnniors who advanced the ball to the center of the field, where the freshmen obtained the ball on a fumble. The freshmen were forced to punt. The punt was blocked, Becker picked up the ball and ran down the field for a touchdown. The juniors kicked off to the freshmen's twenty-five yard line. The fresh- men advanced the ball five yards when they were held for downs. 'rhe juniors advanced the ball five yards when titne was called. In the second half the juniors kicked ofr to the fresh1nen1's twenty-yard line, where the juniors obtained the ball on downs. The ball was advanced to the freshmen's five-yard line, where the juniors lost the ball on a fumble. The freshmen advanced the ball five yards when the juniors obtained the ball on a furnble. Mulvaney then tnade a plunge through the line for a touchdown. The freshn1en kicked off to the juniors who advanced the ball twenty·five\ yards when they lost the ball on a fumble. The freshn1en advanced the ball twenty yards where the juniors obtained the ball on a fun1ble when time was called. The line-up : 1903. Positions. 1905.
