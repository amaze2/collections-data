Schmidt, registrar. All students are urged to take the examina- tit:>n, which along with class rank and O<ther- facLors may :be used by l()c-al draft ,boanls in determining student deferment classifica:tiom. Test Not Detrimental According to Lt. Colonel Brokaw, Deputy Director of Selective Service in New Yo:rk State, .students cannot be hurt by the e:xam results, and the test may be the decisive fact()r for a 2-S classification for stu,dents. who~e class rank falls below the minimtun stan.d- ards. In any case the deei.sion for a ·student's classification wil'l •rest entirely with his local draft board. Every board has a conscription quota which must he met each month, and the amount of pressure on the local board to fill this quota is a decisive facter determining how local students will be classified and how many college students may have to be d:vafted. The Selective Service Qualification test, and the class rank standards recently announced by Lt. General Lewis B. Hershey, which all- pears below, will only serve as guidelines for tl1e local boards; the better criterion will re- ceive more conside·ration. Thus, a student meeting the minimum requirements for either J!cunded at Union College !877 THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 1966 may still lose his deferment because of local draft board quotas •or because of failure to comply with all Selective Service regulations_ Accordi.ng to Mr. Schmidt, Union Students should not worry about ·passing the Qualifica- tion Test, or being re-cla·ssified 1-A as a result of it. \During the Korean War Union stud- ents performed very well on the test. Virtu- ally no students were forced to leave school beeause of the draft; and they were taking many more .then than now.\ Mr. Schmidt urges students to take the test, even though it is not required. Students who are depending upon class rank alone \shouldn\t g'amble, two good indicators are better than one.\ For students who are low in dass ran.k, the test may be their only \salvation.\ Carelessness Is Threat Mr. Schmidt feels that the greatest th1·eat to a Unien student's deferment is Ms o\vn carelessness. Students should make sure that they comply with all of the rules and regu!a- tions of their local boards. \The Selecttve Service i·s one organization one better not fool around with.

Jonathan Pears-on III, Director of Admissions, wa,s nfrt dis- mayed by this figure, however. He noted that the o-verall caliber of this year's applicants is superior, and that competition for a place in .the class has been extremely keen. The conference, sponsored ·by the Education<~] Committee of the Planned Parenthood League of Sche.nectady, will begin with l'egistration at Memor- ial Chapel, 9:30 A.M., after whicll the speeches will be given.

The Kings,ton Trio has sold more 1·ecords than any other folk group in the record industry. Of the 21 albums they have made since 1958, eight have It become certified million seller's.

2 VI'TA Vitalizes Developing Ey Alan Ziegler Operators o:f a school lunch program in Lima, Peru had a .problem. They had to serve 17,000 rations of remns.tituted milk daily, but found thai no mattct· how ha t·d they tried, the puwder was determined 11ot to mix propedy with the water. They went so fur as to have four men beat the milk with a paddle, but tl} no avail. Finally, a letter wa:; s~nt to Schenectady and within a few weeks they rece hed a diagmm of a mixing vat which would rapidly d~solve the powder. Now, the new system can mix 40,000 rations per day, and is more sanitary and. ero.nomical than the old method. Where did thi::; aid wme from? The answe1· il:l VITA, the Volun.teers for International Technical Assistance, an uss[)ciation of 1300 scientists, engi- neers, and businessmen whu have volunteered their free time :and skills to assist in the SI'Jread Peace Cor]lS vofuntl\er worlting in Sierra Leone used suggestions from VITA volunteers in build- ing this school. of teC'hnology to thP developing nations of the world. Most of these volunteers have jobs in pri- vate industt·y ()I' colleges and work on VITA proj- ects at home during their spare time. Aid to Developing Areas FoundeJ in Schenectady in 1959, VITA has re- ceived ov~r J:tHlO problem:; from Peace Corps Vol- unteet's, other U. S. citizens on overseas assign- ments, the United Nations, and foreign individuals and organizations, All uf the;;e p!:oble.ms are of a technical nattuc anti have one thmg m common; they are attempts to improve the lives of people in developing nreas. VITA receives the problem in Schenectady and then refers it to one of its volunteers who corresponds with those concerned and attempts to arrive at a solution. VITA's pt·oblems have ranged from an agricultural work- er in India who inquired about the strength of ~c:ythe blades fashioned out of the springs of dis- <'arded jeeps, to a Peace Corps Volunteer in Gui- nea who needed an inexpensive meru1s of reduc- ing mold-made panda sugar to a powder. VITA was founded to meet an ucutely felt need. ln de\'(~loping arC>as at·ound the world, many prob- lems were encountered which were too small and diwrse to justify the presence of a specialist. l'vleanwhile, in the United States there were many tchnirally trained people who had the desire to donate their services in order to do their share for international aid. The result was that ingen- uity, skill, and willingness were not exploited while countless people were in dke need of them. Who's Exploiting ln 1959, Dr. Robett M. Walket·, a G.E. physicist, held a meeting with several scientists and engi- nueers from the Schenectad,y area to discuss the problem. The solution was VITA. Developing countries, years behind the technology of the U.S. would no long-er have to go through the fmstrat- ing, ti nw-consuming, process of creating a tech- nr>logy by trial and error.· They were now able t·• u:ilizl' tht• n:inds of tlw ad~·uneed Americans, to 11 h\m tht''l' would l>l' basic problems. This con- ' f'·pt put:; a damper on the usual accusation made <Jg·:tin~t the C. S. of imperialism and raises the qtll',;tion of \dw's expldting who? A tnajor ta:sk of VITA is to supply knowledge of basic engineering techniques. A Washington gt·ant enabled VITA to publish \village technol- ogy\ handbooks which describe such processes as well-drilling and sewerage disposal. For CARE, VITA has publtshed \Edukits\ which provides all the material to train 24 electricians in six months. Bamboo In aH of VITA's endeavors, they must pay strict attention to the resources and stage of de- velopment of the area with which they're dealing. ThPy must be extremely careful not to go alxlve the heads of the people they're trying to help. An example of this is the utilization of bamboo logs as water pipes. Dr. Walker said, \We are con- stantly reminded what a chasm separates rich and poor countrie,.;. Often it is a question of bringing somebody not up to our cmTent level but to that of a generation ago.\ This can lead ·to pt·oblems fot· VITA volunteers who must place themseln's back in time. Often they research to find out how things were done in the U. S. before the age of modern technology.

Besides the Schenectady location, there are chap- ters in four other cities and members in 48 states. Its advisory board contains many eminent scient- i-sts.

The poems in 'Imi~ntions' are amongst his be·st work.. The exciting thing about the book is that these are all poems which are inspired by poems of other poets; they al'e not translations. Some- n times Lowell remains close to the original, some- time's not. It is a matter of imitation and inspir- ation, not slavish co·pying. It is the spirit of the poetry of these eig.hteen European poets which he follows, not the letter. He is at his best with Rimbaud, Baudelah·e and Rilke. However, only with Villon does he read awkwardly; he fails to capture Villon's sharp staccato expression. These arc in eve1y sense original poems. Lowell modifies, adds to, and subtracts from the orig- inals just as he pleases. He cuts Hugo's 'At Gauthier's Grave' almost by hrrlf; he adds two further stanzas to Rilke's 'A Roman Sarcophagus'. ·» Throughout he changes and adds images.

The strike of construction worlters last sum- mer ha~ eaused a delay in the completion of . the new donnitories fo1· upperclassme11. The Co1lege regrets, therefore, that it must ask .. ,. students to endure temporary housing arrange- · · ments for the fa-ll term of ten weeks'. U is ex- Dis kid bounded g-leefully out of Bailey Ball the other moming. His most hated 9:30 class ·had just been cancelled, and he never felt better. No·w ther·e was a whole hour to spend soaking up tlu fl'esh exuberance of the new spring ·before ·his most hated 10:30 cla!:-ls. ·: pecter that the Hew dormitories can :be occupied on o1· before January 3, 1967, the first day Qf • the winter term. . The temporary arrangements fo1· the faU . term will include the following: 1. Juniors and Seniers who are independents and fraternity men who cannot be accorn~ mmlated in their chapter houses, will be ' given permission to live oif-cam-}Jus if they can secure housing for· the Eall t~l\'nt only. The College will assist as much as possible in explaining to apartment O:W'll· <>rs the inability of student·s to -contract for more than the fal-l term off-campus.

The maiAtainance, for those ·who don't know, ·is the keystone of Union's physieal education prog1·am. Its goal is to peovide t11' () hours of invigorating exercise each week fer ever:v student, keeping the student body muscular, trim and ready fer :mything. You may choGse any a~­ tivi·tY during these sessions, as long as it is a rha.Jlenge to your strength and skill. .. • Standing in front of Bailey Hall, this k.id was deep in thought, trying to pick the best of all possible activities. Gulf seemed most likely at first, but it's a long walk to the Field House and despit: his enthusiasm, he didn't fee! up t() ·it. • ~. Freshmen will he housed in West College, Rkhmond I-lousP, and in a portion of South College. 3. Sophomores and upperclassmen wishing to remaiN on campus, or unable to .find off-campus quarte1's will be housed i.n ;\forth College (including the faculty resi- ' dence now occupied by Prof. Bronner) at a term rate of $110 for triples; a por-tion of South Co1lege, at a term rate o-1 $130 fo1· doubles; and in the College house at 636-638 Nott Street, at a term 1·ate of $100 for doubles. In addition, a limited Humber of rooms will be availaJJle in faculty homes, at a term rate {)f $130. These wiH be arranged between the fac- ulty member and the student. A list of faculty wHling to house students is avail- able in the Housing Office, Old Gym Hall. ~rocedures and dates for dormitoz:y as- Signment for the fall will be issued by the Hcmsing Office. 4. It is hoped that students wiH be able to move into the .new dormitories following term examinations in December. Details will be announced in the fall.- Afte1· January 3, 1967, students may live off campus only under the followingcircumst::ances: 1.)

A full hour .packed with intensive calisthenics, running, and lifting would be a boost to his massive dr-ive now . . ' entermg- 1ts seventh month, to whip himself back into sha}Je. He flung himself toward the gym. Skipping over the pithy sayings painted on the sidewalk this kid bounced down the gym step's and surged under the stucco Pan Athenian Procession into the locker rooms. Every rnusde ·of his body was t'ngling in anticipation. He marched four steps into the gym and stopped dead. His glasse's wel'e f~gged up and he had to stand and wait for the m-oisture to evaporate. Standing there, he un- zipped his coat and took it off. It must have been a hundred and twenty tepid degrees in the lockers, and the sudden change made him a little nauseous. He gas[}ed for fresh ail\ to no avail. Now he felt rotten. Faithful Socks It was already past 9:30 when this kid finally made it to the sign-up sheet. He filled in his sur- name, which he always supposed was his last name, hi's given name, his initial and his class, but he had to fish in his wallet for his ID card to IJ'Ut in his number. He \VI'ote down \wts and then went over to his basket, number 835. The lock is always a problem. After a lot of anxious tugging th.e thing opened, and this kid walked around sev- eral naked people to a locker. He stripped, and started donning his suit. The socks ripped whe1. he pulled them on, but he managed. mediately. He ran a lap and a half on the track, and slammed his knee on the corner of the plat- form that 'sticks out around one of the turns. That hurt, so he sat down for some wrist curls. Then he just sat. Looking around, he didn't see anybody he knew. One g'uy was lying on a mat with hiB anns stretched over his head getting ready to lift a barbell. He kept lying there. Another guy was doing sit-up's the same way. He saw somebody strugg-ling hard to climb onto the top of the hori- zontal ladder, and then lie down and go to oleep. One guy 1\·as swinging on the rope. This kid kept sitting, doing his rnental isometrics. Fifty Laps At five after ten the checker came. He walked around the track and asked everyone's name. This kid sto1>d up and started breathing fast. He leaned ~gain:st the railing and adopted a pained exp1-ess10n 1.hat rnade him look anguished and l'eady to collapse, as if he had just :finished fifteen- hundred sit-ups or fifty laps. That way he didn't feel guilty when he got his credit. The College regrets the inconveniencE -an<l temporary arrangements necessary for :the fall te1·m. All possible assistance will be given to students to secure housing until the new dormi- tories are completed. It is advisable that hous- ing arrangement8 be made for next fall I:Jefore students leave the campus for the sumrner, \Hey look - someone's exercising~ Oh, it's a cooch.\ It was nearly past 9:45 when he ran up the step>: to the track. There was a lot of guys up there already, but they proaably didn't have so much trouble with their sC>cks. This kid felt slightly ()Ut of it, but he began to work-out im- nack down·staks he peeled and headed for the showers. He turned one on and the scalding water squirted out. This kid flipped the handle to \cold\ and th.e heat eased oif, but then the water got colder and colder, so he shoved it back to the hot side and it was steaming again. You don't really need a. shower if you don't sweat much so he gave it . up and went to get dressed. Someone opened. the door and let in a dnl.:ft that gave him the shlVers. Street clothes on again, basket in the laundry rack and feeling !>eat but neverthe- less maintained, he left the g~·m and walked to Bailey Hall for his hated ·10:30 class, content that he would only have to \think muscular\ once more tbat week_ A problem more or less im~oluble hut nonetheless interesting if not re- warding to the speculative faculties (like, has a dollar more sense than a dime?) is that bound up with the nature of the ·creative process and o-f the artist himself. Grant here our artist as \type\ and let us consider his methods and purposes as mani- fl'~tation:::1 of the neurotic per~onality. Eccentrics Ask a considerable segment of the population whether the m·ti~t is a n€'urotic personality and they woul<l be inclined to answer an immediate yes. We think of the cartoonist's depiction of the fiercely-bearded and oddly-smocked sculptor, the dreamy or dark-visaged poet, the painter starving in his garret amid piles of unintelligible abstractions. And we think of the stories of artists who were suicides and alcoholics and dope addicts and homosexuals and sundry variet!es of peculiar ec-centrics. Then we recall such studies as Freud's on Leonardo and Ernest Jones• on Shakes- peare which have tried to show that these .supremely great artists left evidences in their works of neurotic fixations and complexes. Freud in particular has taught that phantasies of all kinds-dreams, day- dreams, art-works, various kinds of wishful thinking-are the products of unsati-sfied desires When one is blocked in the direct attainment of his wishes, he compensates by huilding phantasy in which, though perhaps in ,eJ·al>mately disguised manners, the wisher has his way. When the artist is frustrated in his attainment of honor, power, fame and the love of ·women,. says Freud, he turns away ft·om :reality to an art medium he finds more maleable, and there he huilrh his dream castle. Phantasy But e\·en if this account of artistic m uti va tion is adequate, does this fact establish the neuro-ticism of the ar- tist? Unless one is willing to use the word \neurotic\ in an unhelp- fully !>road way, the answel\' must be No; ne> person is neurotic just by vir- tu€ of being an artist. It seems more correct, indeed, to view the activity of art as the ar·tist's escape from neurosis than as his escape from real- ity. His phantasy takes <Jn form, afforcls him at least temporary re- lease from his repressed desires, and it may very well work for others. .As bhere are sick dreams, so are there sick art works. .Schizophrenics may paint pictures and model clay and write .stories, and these works will nC>t fail to bear the stamp of their sick creators. And even some <>f the finest works of art-Whitman's \'Sleepers\ and Reubens' \Descent :From the Cro-ss\-may he partially MAMA BIANCHI'S accountable in terms of personality deviations of tlte .artists. But works of art and dreams may be healt.hy or health-inspiring:. Indeed the espec- ial significance ~f the genuine art work lies in the fact that it has suc- cessfully rid itsel:f -of the restraints and Mind alleys ·of the personal and breathes .an air infinite-ly remote from the traiisitoriness of the short-winded excursions of the merely personal. To maintain that art c::reation has a basis in wishes of an ambitious or erotic sort seems to skirt the precarious ice of inadequate re-ductive simplicity. By heroic effort one can squeeze down all the million kinds of psychic dis- positions di'Scoveral:Jle in art to wishes, but the effort seems nflt justified by any great gain in tmderstanding. Rog11e's Gallery Schiller believed that man is com- pletely hum:an .e>nly when he is play- ing, and even aJio--wing for a certain rhetorical exagg-eration, there is pro- fundity in this recognition that play is an achie;·ement, not just something that fills the gaps between work. Dreaming may be moving ahead by our deeper powers, not merely a. som- nolent visit to the rogue',s gallery of repressions. Abnost every thinking man must have some time or othet been struck with the idea that all the world does not gregariously -advance to Truth, but ·onL'Y here and there some of its individuals do; cutting themselves forever adrift because of their advancement, an<i making theDl- sel ves always lia-ble to be regarded ~ith distrust, dislike and often, d-own- nght-though often, conce·aled-fe·al\' and hate. It is perhaps these fearers and ha.ters who are more proiJerly the neurO>tics in our case. Blockage and Flow The artist, then, is not necessarily a neuro-tic; indeed, it is almost aut perhaps not_ quite fair to ~ay that to the extent that a person is an artist he is not a neurotic, for neurosis means. blockage and stoppage and de- stru~t!On; whereas art implies d:y- namlc flow and productive ·achieve- ment. From the time of Aristotle to the present men have 1-ecognized th.at art has a kind of healing power, that it is a harmonizer of jangLing nerve:s, a cathartic to undigested em()tions, a resolver and synthesizer of warring elements, a balm to rawness, and for lethargy an awakene1· and a ca.Il. And sometimes the avtist practices a. homeopathic medicine; we all know that in sadness, for instance, what js often craved are not joyous frivoli- ties, but dirges, Pietas, elegies and pathetic sonatas and symphonies. The question, finally, is not whether there is sickness but whether there is achieved healthiness.

The System forces individuals in th~ middle ranges of 1 intelligence and ability to bear the enb.re burden of the nation's military obligations, while the extremes-both t~e · lower and the upper-· are left free to b~x or study. at thel.I' , plea:sure. This state can only be repulsive to the 1deals of : this country. But beyond this, the present SY$tem does not eve?' f~- , fill its own \ideals:\ it cannot bear the strains which It ; creates. First among these is the arbitrary use ?f class · standings to determine . deferment. Ev~n acc~ptm~ the : College Qualifying Test, It sets up an obVIo~ly meqmta~le I comparison between students in schools of different quality 1 and difficulty. Further it induces students to take \gut\ courses merely to e'scape the draft, thus perverting the basic rationale of both education and the deferment syste!ll· In· addition, it pressures professors to grade. on the basiS, not of academic achievement, but on the possible results to the students draft status. Finally, the element of chance is so important in the decision whether a man is to be taken or not as ~ m~ke rational planning impossible. It gives a fa~e motivation to the continuation of studies beyond the pomt where the student would normally stop. The effect of this is that the eight years between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six are left up in the air-the individual is frequently forced to do things which he would not do by his own volition in normal circumstances. The obvious solution is that the element of chance and discrimination should be eliminated. There are,. essentially, two ways of doing this. The first is to eliminate the element of coercion by making enlistment desira~le eno~gh to gain sUfficient r~ cruits on a voluntary basiS. This can· be done, though It probably won't, by increasing the pay and fringe benefi~ such as educational opportunities offered to the GI. This would be the ideal solution, despite the necessity of. raising taxes to pay for it. The second solution is, in many ways, just the opposite. It is universal conscription. This would eliminate the two problems of the present system, namely the element of chance and the general discrimination. It would necessi- tate a radical revision of the purposes of the draft, for the volume of draftees would be far above present and for- seeable military needs. But there is a huge need for new schools, for men in VISTA and the Peace Corps, etc .. At present, many of these needs go unfilled, but there is no reason why they must. The United States is facing various challenges; but few have ramifications so directly important to the indi- vidual as the Draft. It is presently inequitable and unfair, and it must be altered. Off-Campus The publication of the regulations for off-campus liv- ing for next year raise the question of the propriety of the use of force and coercion to compel students, many legally independent, to live in college housing under rules that, even with the Student Council proposals, are still paternal. There are several good reasons for living on campus, most important of which is the proximity of intellectual and social stimulation. It is the obligation of the college to rely upon reason rather than force to fill -the new dormi- tories. Until such time as it does, the inference must be that reason dictates off-campus living. Thur.sday, Apr-il' 7 1 1966, Letters To The Editor Union College Hote~ls To the Editor: I would like to suggest an altemative proposal to the ·ones suggested by the various committees n9w considering changes in the social rules. It is i;his: open all do1'mitory lounges and rooms, and all similar facilities in fraternity houses, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Let me explai-n the basis of my pro-- posal. The pdmqry function of a college or university is to provide an edue!<ation for its students. The (JUly buildings necessa1·y for this prima:ry job are cla•ss- rooms, laboratories, and a few inciden,tal bui:ldings (i.e., the maintenance shop and the garages). This being the <!a.se, we must ask ourselves why the college has lavished so much money on dormi- tory facilities.. Why has any col·lege done this ? The answer is that the col- lege provides dm·mitory rooms to the students as a matter of convenience 1to them. The college stu-dent is l-ike a tour- ist in tliis sense: he is here only for a brief stay and then must move on. Just as it is clleapeJ: for a tourist in a strange city to re'llt a hotel room instead of an apartment, so it is more eonvenient for the student to live in a dorm. Thus the college, in providing dc>nnl- tory room for students, is acting -as .a large-scale hotel manage1•. If the anali>gy is accepted, if we eonceive -of a dc;>rmi- tory room a~ being equivalent to a ihQtel room, then no restrictions (barring, of course, the usual ones ahout noise and. pets) are justifiable. One can ente.rtain guests in one's hotel room at any l!;ime.;· why should this right -be denied to t.l).e residents of the Unio,n College Hoools- West, South, North, Richmond, P-<>tter House, and all the rest~ Robert A. Fried. '69 Thimm's Cir-cus To the Editor: I would like to comment o.n PrQfessor Thimm's behaviour in the recent Vietnam deb11<te. I fear that Dr. Thimm ne·gated all he had to contribute by his oll!tragoou·s at- titude towards the oppqsing panel mem- bers and the audience, In hi:s openbi.g remarks, Pl'c;)fessor Thinrm opened. the way fo1· a three ring circus instead of a. serious. debate by crude jokes about \in-. Sane,\ (Professor Fox is a member of that organization) about erackpots wiho had voted for WaHace, .and -about memw bers of Sociology departments. He did not have the courtesy to listen to the opposing members' -statements, but dis• turbed them and the audience by his re- Classified LOST: One gold Gruen watch with brown alligator. strap. If found, please contact Bob Lisk at Dl 6-9959 or bring to the Student Activities Olfico. marks to his .co-panelist, his giggles and gesticulations. One of Profes·sor Thimm's helietfs is that the U. S. should negotiate from a po.sition of strength. As the debate pro- gressed, it occurred to me iJha,t if Pro- fessor Thimm were debating \from streng-th;'' that means with knowledge and conviction, he would not have had to resort to tricks of rabble rousing. Irrespective of the points -of view held by the opposing team, they deserve thanks and credit for their tolerance and patienr.--. Henry Foster, Jr. Schenectady Spring Awakening To the Editor: On Tuesday night Union CoHege took a new leap forwal\d. The 'Great Debate' on Vietna-m was a success -and the en- thusiastic faculty, students, and com- munity showed their d-esire for such events. It was a stimulating- hour and a half and was one of the few times . that th~ academic and intcllectual ca- pacity of Union has <been awakened. Spring has. thus brought. a new aware- . ness about its environment to Un:ian; , namely the recent Student Council and ! campu·s relations to Concordiensis, the announcemept of the new -calendar and . registration requirements, the speedy building progress on campus, the very <'nthusiastic I.F.C. worksh01p, and now .he I.R.C. sponsored Vietnam <le1bate. Thus whiie nothing was re.solved at the debate, nor could we have expected :t to, it showed Union breaking from its isolation. Let's hope that this re- sponse and attitude grows. .Jack R.

A long range program which is now being formulated is the new Science and Engineering center. The \center\ will actually consist of a series of buildings, near the present site of the Kappa Alpha fraternity and Bioi. ogy building, and will house the ap- pt·opriate departments. In addition, a plan for the alteration and mod- ernization of the Chemistry ·and Elec- trical Engineering ·buildings will soon be formed. Along with these plans, das!g\1Js for a Student Union, long i.11 the talking stage, seems to be taking shape.

An en scheduled l. 5T r PROF. UNDERWOOD PoliSci Fellowship By Eric Strauss James E. Underwood, :instructor of •poditical science, was recently se- lected for a 1966-67 Congressional FellO'Wship by the Ameri.can Political Science Association. Six otheT politi- cal scientists, seven journalists, an<! one psychologist made up the balance of the fifteen winners of ·the national competition. The fellowship, ·financed by the Ford Foundation, enables the winners to work for nine months in Senate and House offices, with time equa.lly divided between the two. They are paid $6,000, most of which is non- taxable. Orientation Period The program begins in mid-Novem- ber with a six-week orientation pe- riod, during which time the winners participate in ·conferences and sem- mars with other political -scientists, journalists, and government officials. The orientation period serves as an introduction to political activity in Washington, D.C., and provides an opportunity for critical analysis of the role of Congress in the American political sy-stem. General topics of di!!cussion include \The Current Con- gressional .Scene,\ \External Pres- sures on Congress,\ \The Executive Branch,'' and \Press an<i PUJblic Re- lations :in Washing.ton.\ Conferences with academicians, ;members of Con- gress, congressional .staff members, Continued on Page 3, Col. 1 Fulbright Scholar Professor Ferguson, associate pro- fessor of history at Union College, has been awarded a Fulb1·ight grant for research next year at Osman:ia Uni- versity in Hyderabad, IndU!. Announcement of the grant was made earlier this week by Frank S. Hopkins, director of U.S. Programs for the educational and cultural af- fairs bureau of the State Department. To receive a Fulb.right award, an application must be favorably approv- ed by three groups. The fhst is the Committee in International Exchange of the Conference Board of Associated Research Councils. The Committee's decision is based on the candidate's professional and personal qualifica- tions, and the value of the proposed project. : llll '.t.ud application then must be 8JP- proved by the United States India Commission in India, and finally by the Board of Foreign Scholarships, an a-dvisory Committee to the 'State Department. Prof. Ferguson will be studying the relationship between district admin- istration and local institutions of twentieth -century India in order to assess the development of political participation and political conscious- ness in India. Continued on Page 3, Col. 5 Although no definite date has been set for the construction of the center, Mr. Theodore R. Mcllwaine, Business Manager of the College, feels that the school would be prepared to begin in the late '60's and early '70\s. Building cannot begin earlier, because of the lack of adequate funds. Also, whlle the present buildings are being replaced or renovated, the college would ·have no place ·to house the displaced departments. At ·the present time it is not known which buildings wiU lie constructed first, but it is pos- sible that the Biology department may see the first new building be- cause of its urgent need for expanded facilities, Mr. Mcllwaine said. In addition ·to .the long range science program, an extension to the Schaffer Library is tentatively scheduled; however, at the present time, it is felt that the library has adequate space for its purpose and any ad- dition to :it would take pJ.ace only after the new science center is built. There have been no definite plans made as yet conceming: tl1e use of the land where the soon to lJe vacated fraternity houses stan<!, bu·'t one sug- gestion is that they tenp~rarily be made into additional :parking- are-as. High way Plans One change on the campus, which will eliminate a small port-.lon of the school's g1•ounds, involves an exten- sion of a highway s.y~ten:::J through Schene~tady. Currently-, the N' ott. Ter- t·ace arterial system ends a.t the end of N ott Terrace, whel'e ·tJJis street meets Union Street.

If this highway <:ontinues as p}anned, it will be situated <lixectly izJ the cen- ter of what is now the .Se1Jenectady County Library. By \cutting;-'' into the library, the highway -will ·take part of Union's land away, direc-tly to one side of the new dormitol'y complex.

Somewhere inside there is a guardian of We-call it Christ, God, soul, or man, !but search for it and find it,\ pleaded Barry Ulanov on Tuesday at Memorial Chapel. Mr. l.Jlanov, current professor of English at Barnard College, and past editor of many jazz magazines, pre- sented a convocation on \The Endur- ing· Values of the 1\Iedie\·al World.\ Age of Faith? \We've had to put up with cant .phrases too long-,\ he said. \Will Dur- ante calls it an age of faith . . . it wasn't, this is nonsense.\ The Chris- tian Church was ju·st beginning and there was no more faith nor super- stition in the Middle Ages than in any ether era. References were made to the \incredible sme-ll of the Middle Ages\ and the reve>lting Lombard's- \indeed there w·as never a move re- voJ.ting people in the world.\ \Garden of' Truth\ Mr. Ulanov developed his topic by using four famous Medieval figures: Augustine, Boethius, Gregory the Great, and Bernard of Clairvaux. \No figure casts so large a shadow as Augustine\ who helieved \that there is a garden of truth to be dug out in all men.\ It Tequires an analysis of the world around us to become more aware of om·selves. \If we Re'l.rch hard and who we are. It is in this discov- ery of ourselves that we are disheart- ened.\ B()ethius While dealing with Boethius, author of Consolations of Philosophy, Mr. Ulanov stated that \the worst thing you can do is forget yourself.\ This was the lesson Boethius learned wh-ile awaiting his eJ!ecution. According to Mr. Ulanov, if eve1·yone were as pres- cient as Boethius, men would have been on the moon a century ago. \St. Gregory the Great probably had Danforth visiting lecturer: BARRY ULANOV nothing to do with the Gregorian Chants,\ Mr. Ulanov went on to say. \He was not a musician but a man of great rhetorical gift; Gregory had what would now be called existen- tialist thoughts, as shown in his writ- ings on Job.\ Bernard o.f Clairvaux was as as- tonishing as he was frightening. He could tear· men away from their fam- ilies, luring them to monasteries. Ber- nard wrote that \if one loved hard enough, one would find a passion; man never loses a sense of mystery which abides inside of him.\ Anthropologist The Sociology Dept. has announced that it will offer several courses in Anthropology next fall.

4 Modern Figures COnsidered 1 By Carl Rosenstock On Monday night, at 7::30, H. Lee Hirsrhe, professor of art at Williams College, canied 011 an informal discussion about the figure in 20th century sculpture. His talk centered around a series of slides and the wor]o,; shown ranged from Rodin to George Segal. works of Brancusi which were shown, were \The Kiss\ and \The Boy.\ In Giacometti's works, one sees an attempt to reduce as much as poss~ble from the fig-ure and yet retain the suggestion of a figure. The result is that you have statues which look almost like \stick figures.\ Probably the best work, of Giacometti'es .shown, was \Ci·tY Square.\ In this work, the figures with their stick Uke bodies and large feet, seem to be ris- ing out of the surface they're placed on and thev seemed to be stopped in the middle of an action. Baroque Piece Mr. Hirsche's discussio·n opened with a slide of a eighteenth-century piece. He pointed out tha-t the sculptor made every attempt to disguise the medium he was working in and -the figure From Giacometti, Mr. Hirsche dealth with the more ab::>teact :>culpture. Among the works he showed was the work done hy Henry Moore for ;.he UNESCO building, in Paris. Also discussed was the etfect uf the atomic buzuh on arti::>t:>. Tu il u::>trate his point, :.'r1r. Hirsehe slwwell a work t>ntitled \The Screazning Throat.\ Modern Sculpture :\Jr. Rir,;,·h\ n>ncluded w:th a disrussi •. >n of t hl' ,;,·t!lpture •>.f thP I !ll;()'s, nntahly Marsul anrl Sl''-!;:tl. Jl, nn!<•d that today'~ ~~·ulptw·(• i~ not only intPrested in tlw med·ium, whil'h in:ludes paintPd pil'l'l'S of \\'nod, found nbjects and actual srulptun·d pie:es, but he is interested i·n the s('tting of the work. Among those works shown were Marsol's work depicting people oll a beach and her wo1•k showing a typi<·al family of four (one girl and a haby) out on a Sunday _walk. He a~so showed Segal's \Woman Shavlllg Her Legs\ aml his \People On A Bus.\ The return to actual representation can be seen most no- tably in Segal's works. Yet, while his works are realistic, they do not represent a rt;turn to the ideas of Rodin. Unlike Rodin, Segal 1s concerned with people in ordinary situations and he. is con- cerned with not only the people but w1th the setting. Full Cycle H. Lee Hirsche discusses sofe of the various as- pects of 20th century sculpture. Thu~ .:\lr. II irsche described what he consid- ered to be a full cycle. Sculpture had gone through periods of total abstraction and at the end had returned to a form of realism. While thi~ was not the realism of Rodin, sculptw·e had ascribed a full circle, as Segal's works are far more realistic Uwt Brancusi's. Follo-wing his talk, Mr. Hirsche conducted an informal discussion on topics ranging from other, unmen- tioned twentieth century sculptors, Albany's new State Campus, Mr. Hirsche's work at St. Paul's and the ideas of Le Corbusier. of the woman was highly idealized and sur- rounded by little cupid's, From this work, he went on to Rodin. He noted that Rodin's' works were a return to the baroque concept of sculp- ture, noting .the twisting figure and the lack of attempt to disguise the medium. From iliis point, he showed the evolution o.f ideas regard- ing the representation of the female torso. With the works of Brancusi and Giacometti, one sees the idealization of certain human features and expression. In Brancusi's. studies one see~ a minimal amount of deta1ls and yet the hne.s still suggest the human torso. Among those Hirsche, who received his B.F.A. from Yale, has had numerous one-man exhibitions, includ- ing one at R.P.I. Among the prizes he has won are first prize from the Berkshire Art Associa- tion five times, three times for painting and two for sculpture.

The Viking Press: New York. 1965 When the Grand Old Lady of Thirty-ninth street closes her doors after tomorrow night's gala performance, an era of New York City music will close ·with her. For over eighty years, the Metro- politan Opera House has been syn- onomous with the finest in Ameri- can Opl'ra. Boxes But even if the old building is torn down to make way for yet .another office building to cluter mid-town Manhattan, and there is still some hope that she can be saved, monuments will remain to mark her memory. One such is The Golden HorseAhoe, a magni- ficent history of the house and the people who have given it life. Subtitled \The Life and Times of the Metropolitan Opera House,\ the book is over -three hundred pageR long, crammed with ouer four-hundred pictures of some two-hundred fifty of the leading singers, conductors, im- pressarios, and music lovers oi 1 1 1e last eighty years. Chronologically organized by the four editors Frank Merkling, John W. Freeman, Gerald Fitz- fierald, and Arthur Solin, the book begins with the ·search for a site, funds, and a design. The most striking element of the accep•ted plans were the inclusion of 122 boxes, a fabulous windfall for the sponsors, as boxes were selling at ten thousand dollars apiece - and that was in the early eigh- teen-eighties. On October 22, 1883 a produc- tion of Gounod's Faust filled the vast hall for the first perform- ance. \Outside the Oper House, near the boxholders' porte- cochere on Thirty-ninth Street, crowds gathered to watch the ar- rive! for the haut monde, the men dashing in top hats, opera capes wiili red velvet linings, and with tails and topcoats, their startched shirts studded with pearls; the ladies resplendent in tiaras of emerals and diamonds, parures to match, and ermine, sable, or chinchilla wraps. They came in shiny broughams, victor- ias, and cabriolets with crests glistening on the door.s, driven oy liveried coachmen, attended by footmen, and drawn by high- stepping horses .that clopped daintily over the cobbles.'\ Caruso A $300,000 fire in 1893 closed the house for that year, but it opened the following year with a new interior and new owners These were the beginning of the golden years of the house, now renamed the Diamond Horseshoe due to the insta-llation of electric lights.

Met Fans And so the years went, and alway·s the camera was there, re- cording the faces and settings of this triumph, or that. And this is the strength of this b(}ok. F-or the editors have been able to ob- tain a marvelous collection of pictures. Only with this sort of documentation can the true and full feeling for the Home be captured, and capture it they do. It is a stunning work, certainly a must for any Met fan. FERRO PHARMACY 575 Nott Street Schenectady, N. Y. FR 7-0.510 • FOUNTAIN SERVICE German P.lays: From The Frothy To The Complex By Robin Bell On Tuesday April 7th, Professor Freund took a party, !.'om posed mainly of students and fac- U'lty, down to New York City to see two Ger- man plays, 'Die Mitschu.Jadigen' and 'Wojzeck's' performed· m The City C<:nter by the Bavarian State Theatre. Mr. Freund is to be congratu- Lated for his orgaHization of this excursion; on the way down, those of us who managed to stay awake, despite the soporific rhythm of the bus, heard a very helpful and. constructive introduc- tory lel'ture otn the two plays from Mr. Freund. We arrived almost an hour before the pby be- gan, allowing the more thirsty members of the party to vanish rouncl th<> <'ornE>r h<'fOr<' th<' play hPgan. Instant Translation As of the plays tht'lllselves were both pro- rluced in German. For those of us with a hazy or n~gJ.igihle grasp of th~ language instant trans- lation was p!'ovided by transistor radio. This, as it turned out, was the <>Ill' thing which detracted !'rom the evening'::> entertainment. The idea of simultaneous tran::>.Jabm is excellent, but the solo· .female voi:e, which droned without the IEa·st inflection or sign of enthusiasm and gave only perhaps every third I ine, was little or no help. I switched her off eurly in the evening. It was no loss, for anyone with even the most minimal German could grasp the course of the plays from the dramatic action alone, missing ·<>nly the more subtle Auances of language. 'Die l\litschldigen' was written by Goethe at the age of nineteen. The story itself is common- place. The characters - an inl~eeper, his daugh- ter, her good-]or-no-thing husband and the man with whom the daughter had had an affair three y-ears before; each tries to outsmart the other; tbey are untrusting and untrustworbhy; there are comic scenes of mi.sunderstanding before eventually all betray and are betrayed; of course they r,each a satisfactory solution at the end. It is light, witty situati<m comedy. So far this production has no-t had too go-od reviews - I suspect because critics tend to sit in their seats ~nd wait to ·be given a nice .solid 'message' which they can go home and write about. The the·atre in general is, at present, in danger of becoming too didactic. Nobody goes to a play simply to be entertained any more. And that's just what 'Die Mitschuldigen' was - g0od en-tertainment and good fun. The humour was light, witty and fast moving. The quality of the acting was ex- cellent. This was not the easiest ·of plays to per- form for a modern audience, for, where exag- gerated gesture is required, there is always the danger of becoming trite. Interesting Set The set was a good one. It was on two levels; the main room of the inn below, with a stair- case leading to a corridor and bedroom above. 'The costumes were also carefully chosen - it is a pleasure to see a production where care is taken over co&tumes and set - especially the splendidly decollte candy-striped dress of Elisa- beth Orth, who gave a delightful performance as the innkeeper's daughter. An added attraction was -that the scenes were connected by a quaint little group of musicians, dressed as ·a fox, a pig, a duck and a cock, whose fluting and fiddling was an evening's entertain- ment in itself. The light~hearted 'Die Mitschuldigen' was a perfect preparation for the intense and complex •Woyzeck.' The latter was written by Buchner in 1936 when he was only twenty three years old. An extremely existentialist play in its con- ception, it is about a hundred years ahead of its time. At some points it lacks dramatic ten- sion, and two of the characters are in that un- and thus are neither j}Ure puppet-types nor properly developed character-portaraits. None- theless it is a quite remarkable piece for its time. The poor soldier, Woyzeck, cannot get to grips ~ith his situation and is bewildered hy events which crowd in upon him. He is painfully sen- sitive, highly suspicious and distrusting; he has delusions of underground voices; ·all this tor- tures him to the point where he becomes in- sane and kills his mistress, M·arie, who has been having an affair wtth a drum-major. Short Scenes The plot is presented in short staccato scenes, like a collection of pho-tographs. The technique is highly effective for this play, and indeed more could have been made of it, but for some slow prop-shifting between scenes, when a shal'p switch to the next point in the action was re- quired. I don't know how this could have been overcome; perhaps some connecting music would have helped. 'I'he slowness here unfortunately accentuated the fact that there is a certain lack of coherent progre-ssion in W oyzeck's mental degenera.t~on. The set was simple ·and superb. An enormous dirty whitewashed wall, which responded to the wiles of the lighting technicians formed the background. There were few major props; only for a few market-place scenes was much more r-equired; for some scenes a simple sma;ll box- like room was brought on stage. Elisabeth Orth again gave an excellent per- formance, this time as Marie, Wo-yzeck's mis- tress. Woyzeck himself was played by Heinrich Sweiger who rightfully earned a vigorous burst Friday, April15, 1966 Pictures above are two scenes thin edge between sanity and IDIJd®,ss.

This type of music is noted for its de-emphasized harmony. The musical compositions are based on few chord changes or scales, thus creating an at- mosphere in which the musician could construct his improvisation without hav- ing to worry about playing a complicated chord progression; he would be able to more fully express his emotions. (Previous to modal jazz, most musical compositions were based on so many chord changes that the improviser was sometimes hindered in his playing. He didn't have enough time to develop a good improvisation for he constantly had to remind himself that he had to utilize all of the changes. Thus the musician might be forced to play a fast multi- of applause at the curtain-calls. Dozing happily on the bus on the way back to Schenectady, many of us must have realized how this type of project is just as much a part of education as the daily routine of lectures. We have to thank Mr. Freund for his imaginative approach to this part of academic life. All sorts of opportunities to this could be exploited.

Above all, what is a man? Who are we? Pirandello asks. We all have a certain conception of ourself; we see our identity a'S fixed and constant. Yet in fact this is not so: we play numerous roles, and in our relations with others we are not one person, but many. We assume masks- psychologists call them role conceptiona and performances-we play parts. The successful man is one who plays his part convinc- ingly; he persuades others that he is what he thinks himself to be. mi:s!lriGUIIte is often gives results a com}}lex confusing. an amateur difficulties he •• Jt!.pm:or,\ well- Identity Masks 1/ity 'banks depart te Mistress of ittle to divert ro·om of Henr:!f :entury.

The characters in \The Emperor\ all play such parts: the Countess thinks she is a beautiful aristocrat, the Baron an amused observer, the Doctor an objective scientist. What are they beh:ind their masks? A whore, a gigolo, and a quack. Yet they are c()n- sidered the \sane\ ones, for their masks are credible. Henry, whose mask is preposterous and absurd, is thought mad. As the play develops, however, it becomes apparent that Henry is fully consci- ous he is not the German king. Hi:s madness is feigned; it is all a \joke.\ Now who is mad? Is it Henry who sees through the masks to the reality or is it the Countess and the Doctor who blindly be- lieve in appearances? Seemingly, Henry is the sane one. On a deepet• level, however, perhaps he is mad after all. Henry sees throug-h the reality, but preferring the illusion, he does not accept it. He shrinks before the uncertainty of the present and chooses an identity that is fixed and immutable. Refusing to be \one of the men of the Twentieth Century ... torturing themselves in cease- less anxiety to know how their fates and fortunes will work out,\ Henry retreats to the security of a histories! identity. What is madness if not this? ntegral In Modal Trend I solo whether he wanted to or not to include all of the chord in his solo.) Miles Davis Davis was a popularizer of mexia! the late 1950's Davis increasing- the difficulty of expressing him- with tunes of so many chord changes. trumpeter, a lyrical player, simply 't want to run chord changes. Beat, a jazz magazine, it was that Davis's solos \developed as sions of the tune being played than as fillet multinoted chord \) Model jazz was the answer. to Davis's moving recording of from the trumpeter's King of album (Columbia 1355). His impro is simple, uncluttered, and lyri- solo also has a sad almost . It is interesting to note melancholy side rarely shows plays tunes with many chord Coltrane Coltrane, a tenor sax player, is . jazz artist who has popularized Jazz. But Coltrane has developed ~yPe of music differently than Davis In that the tenortst has sought a degree of freedom. Coltrane music on scales. Thus he has ehoice of chords to work by Clifford Safane with in his improvisation. By choosing certain chords from the scale and then augmenting them with other chords, he produces the effect of playing \free\ or non-chordal music. Coltrane's music emphasizes melodic and rhythmic development. What tbe tenorist wa'S doing, was that he was in- corporating Indian music in jazz. Col- trane would improvise over a drone ( pr:o- vided by his pianist McCoy Tyner) wh1le involving himself in an interplay with the secondary soloist (drummer Elvin Jones). The Indian effect was hightened when Coltrane played the soprano sa.x, an instrument which he has helped to popularize. The instrument has an al- most-human wailing sound when played in the upper register. Coltrane's Jazz A good example of Coltrane's modal jazz playing is \My Favorite Things\ from the Atlantic album bearing the same name. It is amazing what Coltrane can do with this relatively simple tune . He takes the gentle song and turns it into a highly tensionized outlet of raw emotion. The sound that Coltrane get's from his instrument (in this case the s-o- prano sax) seems to resemble a human cry. Such an effect carries much emQ• tional wallop, and is one reason why Coltrane's music is so compeling. An effective production of \The Emperor\ must bring out these three levels of sanity and madness. The leading actor must play three role's. Early in the play he must convince the Countess, the Baron, the Doctor-and the audience-that he is mad. At the same time he must prepare us for the later revelation of lucidity. Finally, he must show a disorientation from reality sufficient to cast grave doubts on this lucidity. The success of the production depends largely on the leading actor's ability to play three roles at once. If he fails the play becomes unintelligible. William Meriwether's Henry does not fail. Through most of the first act Meriwether plays a man possessed, a Henry undoubt- edly mad. Gradually and almost imperceptibly, however doubt cr~eps in as an iro~ic gulf devel?ps between Henry and his antag- omsts. There are signs of consciOusness, of sarcasm, of bitterness, so that by the intermision we are left wondering. In Act Two much of thi~ doubt is dispelled:. clearly, :f!enry grasps the reality of his SituatiOn. Yet there remams a cunous, fixed look in the emperor's eyes; and as the lights fade on the throne room the question is still unresolved. Meriwether's interpretation of Henry allows no conclusive judgment of the play. The ambiguity of Pirandello's script is faithfully preserved. Erasmian Fool This uncertainty is heightened by Kent Kraft's Baron Belcredi. Affect~ and detached, the Baron is a . man not taken seriously- as Fr1da remarks, \a fool by professwn.\ But like the fool in \King Lear\ the Baron may be seen as an oracle of truth. Kent Kraft's interpretation of the role strikes a balance between irony and sarcasm, between objective truth and personal bitternesss. Sig- nificantly, the Baron's dying cry, ''He's not mad!\-taken by many as the final pronouncement on Henry-is lost in a chorus of screams. The Baron offers no clue to the mystery; Kraft's ironic-sarcastic interpretation only underscores the ambiguity of the play. In the last two leading roles Werner Liepolt and Gail Blair effectively bring out the falseness of the Doctor and the Countess. Strutting about the stage, Liepolt's Doctor is duly pompous and pedantic. Miss Blair's Countess i's somewhat less successful due largely to poor costuming. The Countess is seen by Pirandello as \about 45, still handsome, although there are two patent signs of her attempts to remedy the ravagss of time with make-up.\ In short, her face is a mask. Miss Blair's unfortunately, is not. Fresh and rosy-faced, she is too little an aging pseudo-aristocrat too ~uch a mi~dle-class suburban:ite tastefully ?utfitted by Macy's.' Her mterpretatwn of the role-vam, proud, sentimental-is highly faith- ful to Pirandello's vision, but the defect of her appearance cannot be wholly compensated for. In supporting parts, Margaret Meriwether and .Jody Sosno.w perform well as the timid Frida and the stiff Marquis. Dave Van- Denburgh, John Shepherd, John Gerson, and Jim Gallagher are adequate as Henry's coun·sellors; and as the two silent valets Jeff Dunn and John Hall are ••. well, picturesque. Earl Robertson's Giovanni looks like a refugee from a Charles Addams cartoon but his part is a small one and detracts little from the overall pr~uc­ tion. Effective Set ~ final word .should be said about the imaginative and highly functiOnal set destgned by Dan Scully. In addition to providing an attractive backdrop for the action, the ·set enables a freedom of movement that could not have been realized in a theatre in the round. A highly complex play such as \The Emperor\ demands the full attention o~ its au4ience. Dialogue must be suppplemented by movement; physical actwn must compensate for occasional ver- bosity: For a sl!ccessfu.l production a large stage is essential. By removmg an entire sectwn of seats and extending the playing area Scully provided the actors with sufficient room to ensure a dynami~ performance. No amount of analysis can clarify what is inherently a highly comp~?x and am~iguous J!lay . . J\nr. company presenting \The Em- peror runs the nsk of umntelhgib!ltty and, consequently, of failure. There are moments when the Mountebanks' production does seem unintelligible. The fault is only theirs in part. Pirandello packed his play with too much historical detail and philosophical wrangling for easy audience consumption. By concentrating on the interrela- tionship of characters and ideas, however, the audience can find in \The Emperor\ an evening of fascinating theatre, and one of the most imaginative and dymanic productions presented at Union College in several years. Hungarian Views U.S. And Union By Lawrence R. Spivack 5 In a warm and genial interview last week, Mr. Ivan Boldizsur, lhu first Hunguri:xn writer to visit the United States under the auspices of the International Institute of Education ami the Ford Foundation, gave candid impressions on topics ranging frem New York City's subways (\from the street level you descend to a limbo ef poverty and dirtiness\) t0 his dislike, albeit an aesthetic one, of dogs in class (\don't you think this is going a bit too far?.\). His reception in the United States, he said, had really been remarkable. \I feel• ve-ry rich because I experienced the feeling of the people here and because [ could give a lot as an in- d!\'iclual anJ as a s0n uf a sma 1 1 :end di,;ta·nt rGuntry.\ Mr. Boldizsnr hopes that some day he will write a book an his stay in the United States and in particular on hi·s week in Sche- nectady. Parallelisms Drawing paraJ.lels lwl-\\'L•en East o.nd \Vt•st, he fpJt that althoug-h pnlitic:tlly the l'11ikd States is fur! lwr from Eastrrn EuroJlC than from \Vest- el'll Europe, American campus life is much near- er to life in Hungary than in Western Europe. The nonconformity in dress touted by the mass media, he found to be non-existent. Confronted with a campus of blue jeans and tennis shoes, he inris-ive'y stated, \you are prac:tic:.dly uni- formed in dress.\ The informality of call:ng people by their first t1ames, he went on to say, is the same as in Hungary. In this n•spert our social familiarity is much closer than that which he encountered in France ·or England where he had been, previous .to his United States visit. \I appreciate the residential school here and I am sure this is almost completely un- known in East Europe. You grow up and learn more if you live amongst yourselves and devote much of your time to your studie·s.\ \In Hungary, university education is free. You receive a stipend in accordance with what marks you get. Books are cheap-hard cover books are the price of paperbacks and paper- backs are the price of a subway ride-but, then again, salaries are proportionately lower.\ Of his stay in New York City, lVIr. Boldizsar spoke in tones bordering on wonderment. \There is no other place on earth like New York. It is the seventh continent. The United States begins west of New York.\ \In New York you feel constantly the races and peoples of five continents. There is no common denominator in the po•pulation. In man- ner of dress, in speech, and in kindness there is a marked difference every five or ten blocks. By the direction and number of streets you are socially determined. During my stay in New York I resided at the Chelsea hotel on W>Cst 23d street. People told me I shouldn't stay there, my image would be spoiled. Yet wherever you go in New York, people are decent a11d nice and friendly.\ Mr. Boldizsar then spoke briefly of his former role in government ru1d the harried times through which he has lived. \I had a position in the post war coalition government with many other writers. I was in charge of cultural affairs in the Foreign Ministry, which in the beginnmg was something quite be·autiful. I was 35, and could finally send my friends abroad as cultural aJttaches and invite well known writers, such as Aldous Huxley, Jean Paul Sartre, and Stephan Spender, to Hungary. The cold war began and it wasn't nice at all. J3y 1950 I bad to stay in government, I co~aldn't quit. Since the beginning of the strong period in 1948 I couldn't publish. You had to live, so I made translations.\ With a far away lo~>k in his eyes, Mr. Bodizsar re- flected, \when you are in it, it is not so terrible. Perhaps like being in a battle and then remem- bering the risk long afterwards.\ On the ideological basis of his life, Mr. Boldiz- sar was firm. \I am a socialist. It means to me a form of life. I never denied this and I never want to. Life in East Europe is Socialist. I think the present experiment in Hungarian society is to marry Marxist Socialism with the heritage of European humanism and this seems to be a good idea.\ \The Kennedy assas'sination,\ he said, \rocked Eastern Europe. People felt that this was the end of the period without tension, for Kennedy was very closely associated with peace. No one could believe that it .had really happened, and had happened in the utopia of the United States. You can't find a person in East Europe,\ he went on to say, \that believes the Warren Re- port. I re·ad it myself, from cover to cover, and I can s.till no.t conceive of such a thing being true. The more the United States says that the Report is true, the less Hungarians believe it.\ As the present editor of the English language 'fhe New Hungarian Quarterly, Mr. Boldizsar said that his office gets almost all .our new.spape·rs and magazines. \I read the New York Times, and my deputy re·ads the New York Herald Tri- bune. Then we switch papers and I read Art Buchwald's column.\ Mr. Boldizsar's staff of five reads everything, although there seem to be preferences. \Everyone wants the New Yorker for the cartoons.\ Mr. Boldizsar told us that he had just wr1tten to his wife and son telling them of the wonderful week spent ·at Union. \I have never felt so near to human beings than during my five days here at your college.\ *YYVTffftTT'fttf¥Ttff'tTtfTTTT'f'fft'lfTTYT'f'Yt'f¥ff¥ 1 ~UR CO.

The position they will occupy during the next year will be one of the most important that a student can attain. They shall be especially important during this first session when the operating procedures under which the Council shall function will be developed. The interim Council has begun the job well. The modi- fications they suggest are sensible and responsible. It is just this kind of action that is necessary to firmly estab- lish the Council. Yet the Council must beware of confusing responsi- bility with pussy-footing. Nothing will ruin it so quickly as an attitude among its members that rules of etiquette are more important than the content of the resolutions. If it should ever decide to soft-peddle legislation out of the fear that it might offend the sensitivities of trustees, ad- ministrators, students, alumni. faculty, or anyone else, it will destroy its importance. The Council must be constantly aware that its func- tion will be to lead campus opinion, not to meekly follow it. It must not be the \kept woman., of anyone except the in- telligence of the members. This is not to say they should be closed-minded but rather that they should be vigorous exponents of their own beliefs. During the coming months, they will have the oppor- tunity to comment on many issues of great importance Among the ones they might profitably study are the fol- lowing: 1 ) The use of coercion in the physical education program. The Council should investigate whether excellence could be substituted and make students want to take gym. 2) Whether the college can allow students to live off-cam- pus if they so desire. The Council should attempt to gain administration approval for this principle. :1) What the future of fraternities at Union should be. The Council should investigate charges of discrimination in certain nationals which have local chapters on campus Further it should determine whether fraternities per- form any useful purpose on campus. 4) What might be done to interest the average Union man in something more significant than weekend bacchanales. 5) How the arts can be given a more prominent place at union. In each of these questions, the All-College Council should investigate without the preconceived notions which so often surround them. They must be willing to think the unthink- able and get to the roots of the problems. And hey must never let a practice continue just because old Eliphalett originated it. Possibly the result will be that there should be no change, but the Council will only know this if it investgates. Much During this month, two men will have spent extended visits on the Union campus. In addition, there will be several concerts. many lectures, and one play. This plethora of interesting and stimulating activity is available to anv student who wishes to avail himself of it. Indeed, there· is more than any one person can find time to see. But it is more than mere quantity that is available. We all know of the speaker who is perfect for inducing sleep, and we all have told stories of them. But this should not blind us to the fine speeches which seem to gain so much less comment. Men such as Ivan Boldizsar and, we hope, Raja Rao can give profound insight into the make- up of another country. Excursions such as the plays seen with Mr. Freund widen our outlook. The man who does not recognize the worth of the good while criticizing the poor is certainly cheating himself of an evcellent program. Think Safe We noticed with interest the fact that the conference on the problem of the population explosion was scheduled on the same day as Senior Week~md. Perhaps they are trying to tell us something? , Friday, April 15, 1966 Letters To The Editor Off-Campus Living To the Editor: In a recent notice concerning housing, Dean Pollock made it clear that when the new dorms open, off-campus living at Union will become extinct (except in the cases of commuters or those wo-rk- ing for their rooms). I believe this is an unfair, arbitrary rulin-g. out of their fraternity house or dormi- tory to avoid distractions. One .goes through an enormous transi- tion after he graduates from -college; he goes from a rule-laden fraternity hot:se er dormitory to a situation whero he i.; cQmpletely on his own. A student goes from regulated inhibition ( especiaHy in a dormitory) to almost complete freedom. Spending one's senior year off campus would greatly ease this transition. a sen- ior living in his apartment is on his own to a great extent. He can make the nec- essary adjustments for independent liv- ing while he stiH has the security of the college. In this way off campus living ].>lays a valuable role for an individual. 2. Provide the Independent with a uni- fied voice in schoo-l affairs. (Social rules might have been revised long ago, if such an organization ex- isted.) :1. Provide needed services for the stu- dent body. ( eg. car p-ools, a -central- ized c-omplete test file etc.) 4. Memhet·shiu (if any on a formal basis) would be non-compulsary and OJ)en to any student. Thus it would not be a Fraternity, nor tend to weaken fraternitie·s, in fact it could conceivably serve fraternities. Such an organization is badly needed hy the Independents to provide services and the ~eadership they would need to contribute more to life at Union. Friday, A •. 4 ,ff''·---- 'l.

Poe1 Continue The Sixtil present a1 read-in. T agreed the read Granted, tl:tere are several advantages to living on campus, but I feel that this is an individual prefeeence and, as such, should be made by the individual, not the administration. It is questionable as to whether the school has the legal right to make this decision for someone, es-pe- cially for one who i's over 21 and con- sidered legally independent. One comes to college for an edueation and, in doing so, concedes the colleg-es superiority and authority in the area of academics. I do not believe that he concedes to the col- lege the 1·ig-ht to tell him how or where to live. . A liberal set of social rules appears Imminent; a step in the right direction, a move by the administration to remo·ve its clutches from the free will of the stu- dents. However this \no off-campus liv- ing\ rule is a step backwards. I am anxious to hear from anyone in- • •· terested in such an organization, regard--• •\ le·s·s of the outcome of the Student Coun- • ided that ..-essary tr~ Most of be present but three, Kinnell ar cil elections. Alan Ziegler '69. Jeff Dunn '69 Box 317 The administration ()OViously wants a closely knit campus and this is admirable, but the number of students who choose to live off campus is not great enough to destro-y this. With the advent of more and better facilities, many students who now desire off campus living would pos- sibly choose to live on campus; but it must be a fret> choice and not a dictated one. Independent Thoughts Ah, Fair Maids During the past few years the admin- istl.'ation ha's taken an increased interest in the plight of the In-dependent Student at Union. This has become necessary as the number of students has increased, while the capacity of Fraternities has re- fairly constant. To the Editor: With the .prospect of having different sorts of maids in the dorms, what, pray tell, do the present ones think will have to be cleaned up'? John Morey, '68 The justification for requiring one to live on campll's diminishes as the student advances from his freshman to his senior years. Perhaps underdassmen could live on campus while sen~ors and, preferably, juniors, would have the pe1·ogative of living off C'ampus. Seniors have 'Such weighty mattet·s us theses, med boards, comprehensives, and grad school to oc- cupy their time and it is conceivable that they might find it pnferable to move As part of my platform, in my cam- paign for Student Council, I have sug- gested as \Organization for Independ- ents.\ Because of some misconceptions I would like to clarify the goals ()f such an organization. Unquotable Quote To the Editor: \As I gather it, the principle of the Selective Servin~ Exams is that you are first fing<>rplinted and then you try to do as well as possible in the test so that the pei\sun next to you will be killed and not you.\ It would NOT be a \Fraternity for Independents.\ Rather, it would be a service organization designed to: 1.

Such tactics, he al'gued, are justified by many \\' .oAmericans because the victims are not white. Relations The present foreign policy of the United States Is seriously detrimental • 'to her image around the world an<! among her al-lies. In discussing the re- percuss.jons of the Vietnamese war, Mr. Emspak stated ,that due to her • \foreign poHcy, the United States is losing the support of her allies. American participation in the war in Vietnam, he argued, is responsible for • '\''r\'·'\' .a.· DeGaulle's decision to with- draw France from NATO and French al:enation from the United States. Mr. Emspak attributed the colianse of between the United States • and Cambodia to Amel'ican activities in Vietnam. Emspak charge.d that t·he pUblic is not being provided with the true facts. • The Johnson Administration, he said, is not being honest with the Ameri- can people. During the election cam- paign, President Johnson ran on a • policy but quickly reversed his position to increase the war effort. Mr. Emspak expressed his belief that the increased draft ·caU, created the escalation of the Vietnamese war, has affected the college com- munrty. Students, f·earful ·of being In justifying infiltration of North Vietnamese, Emspak stated that there are no organized forces from North Vietnam located within South Viet- nam. The only forces from North Vietnam are men, originally :from South Vietnam, who have returned to defend their abandoned families. F-ur- thermore, he argues, Vietnam is all one country and the partition is only artificial. Election Part of the Vietnamese pro.blem lies in the fact th·at the United Stakes has failed to abide by the Geneva Accord. If the Geneva Accord were followed, Emspak stated, free elections would be held in all of Vietnam, all fot-eign troops would be withdrawn and re- ~unifiCJation would eventually be achieved. The National Co-ordinating Com- mittee to End the War in Vietnam is a federation of local peace organ- ·izations which serves to guide the activities of such local groups. Frank Emspak, a twenty-t~o-year-o!d gr~d­ uate of' the University of W1sconsm, has served as the Committee's chair- man since August of 1965.

W o1.tld you believe the us sell .Sage Quill? In an exclusive iniei'View with the CONCORDIENSIS, Elizabeth Huebner stated that the official ·reason for the school's shutdown of the paper was finan- cial. Due to a confused situation, inwhich the school ·business manager who was Sllpposed to do the Quill's billing left in mid-year, many adverlisements were n.ever paid for-. Pl'esident Froman ordered the printer to refrain from printing the paper u11tB its: solvency was assured. Censor Miss Huebner stated tnat the situation has been building for some time. \I believe,\ she said, \he doesn't perceive the importance of communicatio,n.\ For much of the past yeaJ', fo-r instance, he has refused to see Quill reporters. At on time la,st year, he told Miss Huebner that the administration would not cen·sor the paper •but he did not think it was very good. Neverthe1ess, she stated she thought that adminstratiQU's dislike of the paper's policy may have been the -deciding factor- in closing it. \Frequently in the past the administration has tried to pressure the paper into changing Its policy.\ ~['he situation has c~used quite a stir at Sage. As one high-ranking member of the staff said: \Can you imagine a fine institution without a newspaper?\ Our iiJformant refused to allow her nam€ to be quoted in feru· of administt·ative reprisals. Suspension C>ne fat!tiH' which has aggravated the case has been the suspension of thirty- four girls for cutting convocations. The Presidenf!;'s decision to prohibit publi- cation successfully st:ifled the paper's opportunity to editorialize on the move. The CONCORDIENSlS has: no information indicating whether this influenced the decision or not. Tlle future course for the QuiU is still unclear. They will print at least one more issue, paid for entirely out of advertisements that ~!;he staffers have been able to ga.thel'.

The author of such popular works as I\anthupara and The Serpent and the Rope, Mr. Rao went on to say that Gandhi's endeavor \was a move- ment for the grasping of truth.\ The truth was the only thing he was seek- ing; \if he alone was the on~y one who could realize the truth, It was enoug-h for the whole nation.\ Truth is God After the war, Gandhi changed his motto from \God is Truth\ to \Truth is G()d\ because he discovered that truth d~pends on God and not vice versa. \Gandhi lived for this tr~th which for him was love,\ Mr. Rao smd. Gandhi's reputation was not well- kno-wn among the common folk of the world, but they nevertheless felt a kinship for him. Mr. Rao illu·strated this with the story of a peas·ant wo- man in Fran{!e, who, when told of the ass.assinalion of Gandhi, threw down her basket o:f provisions and cried. Asked if she knew Gandhi, she an- swered, \I don't know who he is or where he come's from, but I feel like I lost a father.\ For- Gandhi, there was only \one way of action: the non-violent way.\ Acc01·ding to Mr. Rao, Gandhi's hatred of violence was fostered by his read- ing of the Sermon on the Mount and the works of Tolstoy and Thoreau. During World War II, Gandhi was ap- palled by the killing of the Jews and tlu attacks of the Germans and the Japanese. He wired Winston Ohurch- ill, 'llt-ging him to meet with Hitler, but ]tis request wa·s denied. Here, Mr. Rao added \one never knows what wou1d have happened had Gandhi seen HitlEl'-\ ll'he Indian novelist then told his nudi ence that Gandhi was greatly in- fluenced by his religious mother and bis ho-t-tempered, patriotic father. At €igh.ieen, Gandhi left to study law in Eng-Jand where he found Cru·istianity. On :his return to India, \Gandhi de- dded that if England stayed, India would go backwards, not forwards.\ In l~:>.J, Gandhi began his non-violence lh<Jv~ment, thinking that \if every man t:ried hard to seek the truth there would be national and pm·sonal free- do--m.\ The British machine was shak- en: for the first time, but when one policeman was killed, Gandhi stopped tile Entire movement.

The Work- shop consists of a sixteen piece Stage Band and a M()dern Jazz Quintet, and has been praised for its several per- formances on campus this year. The concert i's free and open to the public.

Supreme Cowt decision on obscenity in literature will be held at the New School for Social Research, 66 West 12th Street, New York City, on Fri- day, April 29, beginning at 8:00 p.m. More than 500 students from col- leges throughout the East are expected to attend the event. The implications and ramifications of this highly controversial ruling will be discussed by outstanding 'speakers in the fields of law, publishing, the arts, religion, psychology and socio- logy. . Admission to the teach-in, which is being sponsored by the New School B.A. Student Council, is free. Adtninistration To Act On Social Regulations By Lance Polya At an Executive Committee meet- ing held last Monday, the Board of Trugtees raised no objections to a new set of social regulations ·su,bmitted by the All College Council. The concept of change was approved unanimously by the trustees contin- gent upon an effective means of en- forcing the new rules. Monday Meeting Thi's will be the topic for discussion by the entire student body, the Inter- Fraternity Council, the interim All College Council, and the administra- tion at a meeting to be he'ld next Mon- day evening in Memorial Chapel, at 7::30 P.M. Student Council president, Jeff Ratner, wiH reveal the specific de- tails of the amended proposal and call upon the students to suggest methods for its implementation. The authorized changes are quite similar to those formulated by the Student Council, and may be found in the March 24 i'ssue of the Concord- iensis. The main ideas that were pro- posed included permitting female guests in ll}unges and rooms at speci- fied hours, and storing and serving alcoholic beverages in the dormitories, by residents over 18 y·ears of age. Suggestions Representative Prc>sidcnt :Hartin was extremely plea~erl that cnnrerteu effort to change the ('x:st.ng- ~~~,·ial n·gulatiuns was or- g:tn:zt•d and aL'tL·d U!Jvll entin:ly b:y inten·stcd, hal·d-wt•rking and dedic::tted studenL. I! e bl'!ievctl that the sug- gestions submitted to the tru::;tce,; rep- resen t,·d the 11 i,;]H:s of a full range of stwl<>nl opinion on t'tc conl'ept of so- cial cha11gl'. The PresidPnt was con- fident from the ~tart that the Council propo~al \vould be favorable to the trustees. 'l'he final draft of the s()eial regula- tion will he written following the dis- cussion on Monday en:>n·ing. All of the administrative officials emphasized that no rhanges in the present social rules will b2 :nstitutcd until a means of implementation and enforcement is E'stablished. An anticipated date for the transferPnre to the new set of rule·~ wa~ tC'ntatiw·ly set for Spring WeE>kend. The basic ideas incorporated into the social rules will prevade for the tntire col1€ge community, and the college will reseLve the right -to intervene u.nllat- erally on ques·tions of jurisdiction or interpretation. Howevel', the rules will be flexible enough to be adaptable to any fraternity or dormitory group. Dean Pollock envisions the social cha.nges as \good for students pro- dded they recognize there exists a great deal of personal and group re- sponsibilities.\ Student Rights ['he Student Council proposal, as the Dormito1·y Counselors and the So- nation of the petition submitted by the Dormi.tory Counselors and the Social Rules Committee of the Student Coun- cil. On April 13, this consolidated res- olution was fotwarded to the All Col- lege Council, composed of the two deans, two professors, and five stu- den·ts. The All College Council reviewed the Student Council resolution and made several amendments, including the reservation of one lounge in each dormito·ry to be used exclusively by Union men. According to Robert Ben- jamin, an All College Council repre- sentath·e, \an overlying consideration \Vas that we felt that we had to re- spect the rights of those students who ll\<.·t·e 11ut enll'rlaining frmale guests.\ Tl1e:'C' C'hang-e,.; \\'l'l'e approved unan·i- muu•l_y !.y tlll' \\II l'c•llcgc Council, and :h.,· :11 ~.endvd prup,·~al \\.a.:; .;uLmitted to the tru><tec'S via the Pre:sidc11t's offiee. \Be Present\ Jelf lL!tner anJ I.:d Clark, who wer.; in.otl'umcntal in formulating the ac- cepted pruposal, urged ;.,II students to ~1ttend next :.\Iunduy's meeting. \The success of the entire social regulations' program hinges directly upon individ- ual 1e.::;ponsibility and initiative.

Eent Kraft, a member of the clas's of '68, will study next year at the Uni- versity of St. Andrews in Scotland. Bob Heine, Bill N eidel, Stan Gulin and Reg Kahrimanis will study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Te·ch- nology, or E.T.H., in Zurich, Swi,tzer- land. Kent Kraft, who ranked second in his class, was chosen from a number of applicants, all of whom ranked near the top of their class. The selection was made by a committee of both fac- ulty and students. Among the commit- tee members were Dean Theodore Lockwood, Dean Ne-al Allen, John Beck- ennan, last year's exchange student to St. Andrews, and several members of the faculty who have taken part in the St. Andrews exchange program or one similar to it. Varied Interest .According to Dean Allen, the com- mittee was seeking someone who pos- se-ssed depth, alertness and a range of interests. The committee also sought a student who showed an interest and ability to contribute to the college cornrnunity. . Kraft is _presen~ly majoring in Eng- hsb and will contmue to study in that field at St. Andrews. The program of study which he w.ill fo,Jlow wil! com- ply with the standards imposed by St. Andrews rather than those used at Union. This is because the British educational system followed at St. An- drews differs greatly from the one used at Union College and most Amer- ican universities. The exchange program with St. An- drews, Scotland's oldest Unjversity, was started in 1937. The pro- grarn provides :for an exchange of professors as well as S<tudents.

2 Campus Politics : ·Controversy Over Apathy Beckett-Enigma; Lessing - J..~eeker By Robert Fried Administration officials and leaders of student political organizations apeed this week that the Union student is generally apathetic politically, hut they disagreed about the causes of this dis- interest and the role of the administration in fostering concern. Hu2zon! Neal W. Allen, Deal! of the Center for the Humanities and Social S.eiences, said that \out- si<le of the students intErested in: the Interna- tional Relations Club .and the Political Forum, m·y impression is that tll·ere is not a. great deal of interest in direct political action by Union students. This is no-t something that interests them very deeply.\ Cal'! Feigenbaum, '67, co-chairman of the Political Forum, was more emphatic: \While what the dean called \rushing around with ban- ners\ in demonstrations. Zauderer pinpointed two causes: because the col•lege is not coeducational, since .at a coed school .political action \be·comes a focal poirut for inte1·esting activities' 'and becomes related to one's :personal Ufe; and because the pressure towa:ud conformity on campus· tends to inhibit expression of political views, because it puts one in the position of being socially undesb:.able.\ He said this is especially true of freshmen, who might be afraid to antagonize potential fratemity brothers by being politically outspoken_ Edward Pollock, Dean of Students, was reh.tctant to attl'ibui:e the dormant .state of political activity to any one source; \I ·don't know \l'ha.t to attl'ibute it to,\ he said. There was- general agreement that th€ level A lonely marcher symbol of the nation's political unrest, paces in front of the White • House. And how goes it at Union? ---·---------------------------- I've been here, this place bas been dead. The only excitement was the riot. 'The apathy around this place is just amazing. r:-.:othing is being done politically.\ But .Mark Zauderer, '67, pve.sident of IRC, feels that \there h;as been an upsurge of political interest here in the past y·ear.\ It was generally felt that student apathy was at least 0one cause Df the a. pparent lack of concern. Dean Allen said tha:t \a \'ery large number of union students, in my judg-ement, have practical goals in mind for their education. They're very career-oriented,\ and thus are not concerned with of activity on t:1e Union campus should he higher. But there wa.s sharp disagreement about the ad- ministrstion's role in discouraging political action. Restricted Politicians F8igenbaum sta.ted flatly that Dean Poll(}ck has restricted the Young Democrats .and Young Republicans in the past by not permitting them to attend state conventions; he did this, Feigen- baum said, by refusing to give these groups suf- fieient funds to travel to the conventions: \De.an Pollock's philosophy is that there shouldn't be any paz:Usan political activity on campus. N ert year Works Display Versatility Diversity is the main feature of the display of the works of Mrs. !.\la1·ie Masotti, in the Nott M-emorial. The workfl includ-e water--colors, mosaics, a ceremic work, Chinese ink and brush works, collages and oils. Within these various works one can s-ee the Lnfluences of many varied St>h(}()lS. The subject of her watercolors is generally :\ew England life. Alnong the works are two entitled \Stormy Day at Cape Porpoise\ and \Lobster Traps at Kenn.ebunket,\ whi·ch show the distinct influence of Winsl<Jw Homer. Homer, who was perhaps the foremost nl:'tist in. the tradition;al American watercolor school, did quite a few paintings ·of the New England coastline, dealing with many of the same sights that Mrs. Masotti is concerned with. Other paintings, notably \Sugartime \Saltbox H1>use\ and \Windsor Barn,\ deal with other aspects of New England lif-e. One watercolor worth mentioning is a work entitled \Pine and Rocks\ which Ls a beautifully clone woodland scene. On:-e can easily feel the darkness and silence inspired by Mrs. Masotti's rendering of this idyllic setting. Two Portraits The first oil painting {)lle sees upon entering the gallery is a work e-nt.itled \Danielle's Child- ren.\ It, and another wor-k entitled th-e \Broom maker,\ are very different from tne water colors. These two are portraits a.nd the colors used are hrighter than the others. The lines are clearer and the contrasts are sharper. In the water colors the lines and colors seem to melt into each other. When viewing these works, one can b-e easily struck by the sinnilarity between them <Ln<l the works of many great M·exican artists, in particular Diego Rivera:. and Jose Orozco. Al- though the latter's works involve much sharper contrast, one can easily see the influence of these two artists. It is of interest that works were painted in Mexico. Of the three mosaics, \Blue and White Mo-s.aic,\ \African Jugglers\ and \Sunflower Mosaic\ the most impressive is the \Sunflower Mosaic.\ In this wo1·k, the sunflower appears to be gl'owing out of the background. The colors are striking and eye-catching; most stl'iking is the contrast between the yellow and the green. The D<ther two are n-ot quite so good and are more abS<tract. Of the two, the \African Jugglers\ is th·e better. Perhaps the most striking works are tho.se shmving a distinct Chinese influence. While the W(}rk:s are done in an Oriental style, their ,;ubject matter is Western. The.re is one ink drawing, en- titled ·~Sierra Madre\ and it consists of a sketch of a waterfall with calligraphy on the sid·e. Underneath some .of the works are transultions of the calligraphy, or colophon. \Blue Jay and Oak\ is an interesting work in that, al~.houg-h it is not done as a classical Chinese water colol', it still shows the marked angularity which is in- herent in Oriental water colors. Impressionistic Masterpiece Pr&bably the most striking, and u·ndoubtly the finest work, in the exhibit is an impressionistic work entitled \Fiesta-Night time.\ The painting is o{)f a Mexican fiesta, at night, and ex:hi bits a sharp ccmtrast between the blue and black of the night;s an<! the bright yellow of the lamp and the dress of one of the women. From the 'dress' yellow, the rest ·Of the woman seems to melt bacl< into the night. It is a truly s•triking painting. Mrs. Masotti, whose husban<l is an alumnus of Union, first studied .art at H.arpur and then studi·ed under Eliot O'Hara, John Pike a,nd John Chetcuti. She studied Chinese brush work with Wang Chi Yuan, in New York. Her works have been displayed at the Arnot Gal·lery in Elmira.

FR 7-0510 • FOUNTAIN SERVICE Skidmore is forming a committee to e11d the war in Vietnam. I seriously dGubt whether ·the dean would allow thi.s to happen here.\ The dean denied that th1s was true. \I would steadfastly deny any such charge,\ he S'a.id, \and I would say that the person making tlliat state- ment demonstrated a lack of know1edge about what goes on here. I have no control over the funds.\ He said that the Tax Committe-e is the group which approp1·iates funds for oampus or- ganizations. \I've never forbidden any s:peaker or dem- onstration,\ Dean Pollock said. Administration's Role Dean Allen felt that \the admhlistl'>ation is neut:3:1 on _this. It's not the role of the colle·ge admrmstration to urge students on.\ Zauderer disagreed with llis :~wsit~on, sbating, \By :Standing aloof, the administPation is passing up an op- P?rturri.ty to use i·ts influence and bring political dLscuss1on to the campus. This unfortunately is .a tacit discouragement to politic&! acti@n here.\ . The deans both felt tha~ .the two student po- htteal groups, lRC .and Po:h.tlcal Fol'um, are doing :1 good job as far as fostering ill'terest in politics IS concerned, although Dean Polbck said that he would like to see more activities on the part of these organizations. Feigenbaum, too, feLt that the two groups have not been ac-tive enough, but said the real reason was limited funds and time. Za!lrerer believes that \the Political Fol\Um and the IRC are poorly equipped to foster poJi.tical activism beeause of the soarce of their funds and the resulting limita-tions imposed on their func- tions.\ Conducive Atmosphere As far as the role of the administration in furthering student interest and participation is concerned, Dean Allen 1s convinced that «the ad- ministration should create 'the kind of atmosphere where students are awa:re of politics. Tb.e total impact of college should be one of encouraging students to think about public issues.\ Dean Pol- lock believes that the coJlege should continue to do as it is doing now: making its facilities avail- able to student groups, formally involving the faculty as advisers, and \welcoming political can- didabes here.\ The two student leaders do not agree, however. Both feel that the administration, by .sibting idly by, does in f.act discourage interest in politics. Zauderer would like to see the administrartion use its ''contacts\ to .secure political speakers. Fcigen- baum feeLs th~t the college should help enc1>urage partisan activity by allowing partisan politicians to ·spe.ak here, which he ::tie<els has not been done i.n the past; by permitting students t) attend conventions 1>f :politioal organiz;a:tion.s; and by \making sure that both the Young Democrats and Young Republicans are viable\ by giving \equal time\ to speakers o-f both parties. ·cAM,PUS ·CALENDAR Friday, April 22: Lacrosse; Union vs, Hamilton, 2•30 p.m. Daley Field.

THE GOLDEN NOTEBOOK, Doris Lessing. BcGraw-Hill. THE SHELTERING SKY, Paul Bowles. New Directions. Samuel Beckett is an enigma; his plays have been acclaimed by modern audiences who have hailed him ;as the genius of present-day theat1'e· his poetry has been largely igno1·ed'-wrongly &o, fol' he is a better poet than a dl'ama~tist; his prose work has had a l'ather non-conunittal re- ception from the <!ritics, who appear to be quite 1 uncertain as to how they should go about asse>S- sing him. 1 t is interestmg to know that the one cr1t1C wh1> does oome out w1th a definite statement is quite wrong: /eli oms \. . • there is not a word, a phmstJ, a sentence in th1s narrative tha·t is not crystal Clear, and in tHe s.mpJe::.t m .i!..ngush or insh Idioms , • .'\ New l'oew xOl'K Heral<l '!r1bune Hook !teview. 'l'hat a critic should feel it at all necessary to assert thiS arou~es unme(!Jate susptclOn. On 1 t!Jscr inspect,on, one finds that there are many passages m tne book, especially in '1'he lmnam- : able,' whlch are Slillply uot crystal cleax and not in ··simple l!:ngush or Insh IdiOms/' The three novels were hrst wrttten in .l<'rench and Frenoo lingu1stic structures are by no means discarded in the translatiOn. BecKett, who has been widely compared with Joyce for Jus style and techruques in prose, is not an easy writer to read. The text is almost entirely without paragraphmg and thus requires really intense concentrawon on the part of the reader. His condensed style, his literary allusions and his comp1ex puns CJ.ilmand a pretty sha1•p wit to appreciate the whole. This trilogy must be read slowly and carefully: taken thus, it is a :rewardi-ng experience. Al- though .the oent:r-al theme of ·all three novels is pain and death, the writing is nD't morbid. There Is a sense of deep conviction and of real love within the narrative. These novels are a chal- 1enge to any reader. Once immersed in Beckett's world one does not readi·ly forget the experience. Great Book Like Beckett's, Dol'is Lessing's prose has never had the acclaim which it deserves. \The Golden Notebook\ is her one really gre·at work. It is in all senses of the word a grea.t ·book. Its size and scope and the ambition of its conception make a reader approach somewh.at in awe. This is the story of Anna, the novehlst, who devotes herself to a search for real personal integrity. She sets out to find God, to unite her- self with the absolute. She keeps a set of note- books; in one wi:th a red cover, she records her past political life, her communist aff1lia.tion am! subsequent disillusion; in her bl•ack •book she writes about her experiences in Africa; Her yel- low one is in the form of an autogiographical novel; the ])lue notebook ·is a record of personal day to day events; at the end of the novel comes the golden notebook, which begins to link to- gether .all the threads of Anna's life and descri·bes her falling in love. It is a very beautiful, irutelli- gent and powerful worlc, a work of great sbature which might well be in the future one of •the 'few survivers of the imm~d1ate post-war writing period. Expedition \The Sheltering Sky\ is a r,ather disappointing book. Paul Bowles has a pleasing enough style; he tells his story well; th€ book has .a good move- merrt 1Jo it. He creates a classic scituation with husband, wife and male friend of th'B f-amily set- ting off on an African expedition. The characters are quite well drawn and the plot evolves per- fectly. Why then is the book not exciting? The pl'oblem is that it is too neat, too organized too pat and too perfect. The inevitable denouement of tlle novel lacks poower simply because it is too obvious from far off what is going to happen; the stoJ'Y ticks al\lng like ciockwork It would be acceptable as good lightweight fic.tion, if that was all that it purported to be. However, Paul Bowles has pretensions of being a top-flight author. If he gave up fiction he could proba-bly write a very competent travel-ogue. t t tiT T 'f ¥ f ¥if T f 'T T f T T f f f t f ¥ f t t f' t t W ¥ t y T''T y w t t 'f tV i ¥ t ¥ t ¥¥ f ¥ t ¥ t 'f t t ¥ + t 'f ,f' t 'f t T 'f t • Jay Jewelry Co. 315 STATE STREET 2>lamonda • • • Purchased in Belgium and Imported for Your Savings.

Involution By Barry Newman One of the best preserved traditions of Union is a.bout to crumble with the social rules change. 1 am not re1erring to the image of pur1ty and chast- ity which has been emba1med and buried in the pages of the college catalog these many dec- ades. What I am thinking of is the mood of immorallty which invades every party, liv · es with each student and' each date, an d does far more to · estabiish an image of decadence on this campus than more permissi ve regulations do elsewnere. HeterosextJals one of the prime attracti ons of parties here. After a week of diligent study a h ealthy d ose of the devil can be invigo1 ·a ting, and becomes a delight when coupled with a crack at the es- tabHshment. Outwitting the IFC is almost as much fun . as w ; inni n g a game of cop s and robbers. Scampering up · the stairs while t he chapeNne is fiance is di-ssipated until the strategy of the descent is con- si de red. W hen t Ms campus was dry, smuggling was probably the high point of any par ty. Today the best re l ease is found in sneak · i n.g around the fra ter - n ity or, less f req uent l y, the dormitory.

Non-Violable Caligari, dil·ected by Robert Wien~, is a stol'y told by a madman ( a'lthough his madness is not revea : led untvl the end of the picture). Shortly after a strange doctor has displayed hi::; somnambulist at a fair in a small Ge1'man town, the community is plagued by a series <>f wei · rd, inexplicable murders . It is an old, time-worn, d·ecadent Romantic theme; but here the resemblance ceases. Wiene, applying modern psychological insights, is able to go far beyond the cheap tl'ickery of gothicism, · developing a texture rich in complexity and fil'led with involution. When the hero's be'st friend is found dead, the young man begins to suspect Dr. Caligari and the somnambulist Cesare. He reports his suspicions te the authorities, but without avaiL Beside the wily docto1·'s powers, the efforts of the police are childishly ineffectual Here at Union, a spirit o£ adventure can always be de- tected at patties. Plans are carefully set in order to a v oid the demoniac purity patrol, and women must be instructed never to · be seen on the stairs with a man. The poor g i rl who is used to being treated 'as a normal heterosexual a t other men's coLeges, is suddenly swept by guil:t feelings, an d may need a visit to her anal · yst on the Monday aiter. The Union student, who finds it ne-cessary to explain .away the rules, be- gins to feel as if he is Wlallowin.g in sin. He defies the conse- crated decency of his very proper school so often, that he considers himself a degenerate, and before long begins to en- joy it. \And when the chapN'ont.•s turn their backs, head up the up-staircase pronto\-that's the way i t was.

It i s y o ur du ty However, the 'hero persists in his inquiries and discovers that C~ligari had g1ained his power ever Cesare through his mastery of medieval witchcralt and had commanded him to commit the murders. Thu·s, through the mind of the young man, Calig·ari is presented as evil incarnate, a man who kills solely for the .pleasure of killing. But the final scene, carefully and expertly worked up to through the uses of psychological and nee-Medieval symbolism, 'reveals that Caligari is actually the head of a mental institution in which the young man is occupied. Subjective T~uth The metaphor, the automatic image of the Surrealists, the phe- nomena . of dreams or trance - this trio of · elements make neither sub- jects for \scientific\ inquiry nor ~ ·e t \abnormal\ fantasies for morbid exploitation by irresponsible persons. As tru e for every genuine artist, they are pal't of, or a technique for expressing, normal human experience, a working of the imagination projecting itself honestly in terms ef a given medium. Here, the imagination u:ses facts only as starting points for a complex symbolic picture, as elements of com- position, for a total form expressing, if not alw a ys identical with, a complete human experience. Subjective photography, employing sharply contrasting black and whites, characterizes the phantasmagoric Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Two things distinguished Caligari as a film: the daring of its story-within-a- · story .and the startling originality of its decor. To suggest that what we see are the ravings of a madman, Wiene de- liberately adopted stylized settings ~grea t angu lar shadows painted a deep black, streets and walls and sky all starkly white. Even the furnishings are unrealistic. When the young man reports his friend's murder to the town constable , be finds the official perched high on a six-foot s • tool writing in a tremendous ledger-reminiscent of Goya- an eerie symbol of authority.

Today, however, things are beg1nning to change. Ja zz men such · as Dave Brubeck and Count Basie who have gathered a large following are now starting to be see~ on tele- vision and being heard on radio. People are thus becommg more familiar v•ith jazz. As a result of thrs new exposure, jazz is now in- fluencing other forms of music and vica versa .. This is espec i ally true with rock and roll. Raga-time John Coltrane, the jazz tenor sax player, has been interested. in the Indian song form called the raga for some time now. Unl1ke Western music,\ t he raga lacks tonal centers since it is ba~ed on . scales rather than chords . Thus the soloist has more freedom m cre - a tin g his improvisation since he isn't limited to certain ch ord s. A good example of Coltrane's interpretation of Indian music is his version of \ Chim Chim Cheree\ from the album The John Coltrane Quartet Plays. (Impulse 85). In the March 31 issue of The Village Voice, it was reported t hat the fol<k rock group called the Byrds have a lso become inte r est ed in the raga. David Cro'sby, one of the Byrds, said that the group's new re cord (which wa sn't mentioned) was very much irufluenced by a ~ certain jazz musician named J oh n Coltrane. The recor~ suppos~dly contains one genuine raga cho r us played by two g wt ars . A:ptly enough, the Byrds' ne w music is called rag a rock. Jn 1963, rock and roll disk jock e ys were play i ng Mong;o San- tamaraia's version of \Watermelon Man.\ The tune became a fair ly big hit. It's popularity wa · s due to a catchy melody and a finger snapping rhy thmic quality. It is interesting to note th at \W at er - melon Man\ was written by Herbie Hancock, Miles Davis's cur l'e nt · pianist. As Hancoek conceived the tune, \Man\ larg ely fits into the soul category, a · type of music which is very bluesy. Some Funk But the greatest influence that ,iazz bas had on rock and r oll has perhaps been through the efforts of Ramsey Le wis . The pianist . took the rock and roll tun e called \The In Crowd,\ a dded a ja zz de- . vice ca ll ed funk (for all intense purposes soul music), and came up with a big hit. But Lewis's recording of th e Beatles \A H.ar~ _Day's Night,\ found on the al bum Hang on Ramsey (C adet 761), 1 s an even better example. When playing the tune, Lewis had his drummer play a fairly tasteful rock a nd roll beat \'>bile he proceded to cr-eate . some really exciting funky i mprov is ations on the tune's chord charges. The result was a melodically superior tune than the Beatles' own ver 'sion while still r eta inin g the basic be at of rock .

EditOl'·in-Chief ROBiU~T ROSENTHAL '67.. .............. 346-9959 . .. ............... IJusinE'ss Manager A W elcotne Spirit The action of the Board of Trustees last Monday in authorizing the administration to l~b.era:li~e the social rules is welcome evidence of the new spmt which now pervades the college. . The importance of these changes cannot be underesti- mated. Finally, the rules will conform to th~ ac~~al needs of the students. No longer shall the appellation the mon- astery on the: hill\ be a;n accurate de~cription.. . . .. But as 1s usual w1th the grantmg of pnv1leges, this one includes responsibilities. Both the students and the ad- ministration must make sure that the final form of these rules will be the best possible. To do so, several observa- tions must be considered. The first of these is that the specific prohibitions with- in the new rules should be formally determined. Nothing is so bad as to have vague niles of the sort that \a!l con- duct unbecoming a gentleman is illegal.\ Rules of this sort are easy to write and are therefore popular. Nevertheless, they are equally easily lead to repression of individual con- science and differing personal codes o~ conduct. . When these specific rules are wntten, the basic con- sideration should be whether the rule affects conduct pri- marily individual or conduct which has far-:r~achi~g effects on other students at the college. The admimstratl.ot;t .mus·, realize that a student must be allowed the responsibl!Ity tc. follow his own conscience so long as he does not direc!ly interfere with the rights of others. Whether yve ?-gree With his code or not, is not relevant. The only pomt IS that the college is not designed to inst~ 3:ny moral c~de ~1 its stu- dents. If it attempts to do so, 1t IS overstepp1ng Its proper functions. . . The student must also keep .several points m mmd. 'The first of these is that these rules will affect them more directly than most anything ~lse that shall be done. tJ:Us · year. It is, therefore, Imperative tha.t they show.thelr m- terest and concern for this by attending the meetmg Mon- day. Not only will this meeting ~o~ the student .body· of the form of the new rules, but It will also allow him to: take part in changing them if change is still necessary. The second point is that the student body will be .on trial when these rules are finally put into effect, which now appears to be for Spring Weekend •. May 14 .. If the! privileges are abused, they cannot be contmued. It IS up to every individual to ensure that they are not abused. Much of the formal procedure for change has been determined. But there still remains the implementation. A relative few took part in the former. But every student must participate in this latter, and more significant, part: of the social rule changes. With Vigor The letter from Ben Volinski, printed in the columns to the right, is a disturbing sign for the future of the All- College Council. If the attitude it conveys is put into effect, it will doom the Council to ineffectiveness. Mr. Volinski is quite correct when he caHs atten~ion to the function of the Council as a means of commuruca- tion. There is no doubt that it must do this. Nevertheless, to interpret the Charter in such a manner as to lim_it the C()uncil to this exclusively, shows little comprehension of the possibilities of the Council as a meaningful legislative body. 'The basic point is that the Council, and its members, must be more than a passive mouthpiece for student opin- ion. If the Council were to do no more than repeat the suggestions placed in the Suggestion Box, there ~ould be no point in having it at all: the Box would be .sufficient. In short, what we do not want is simply government by plebiscite. But these men who are on the Council have been chosen as men who should be superior individuals, men who • have thought more deeply about th~ prob~ems faping ~he · college, men who have more expe~1enc~ m. de~mg :w!th · these problems, men who are ~ore 1magmatrv~ m deVIsmg • solutions to the problems. This, supposedly, IS why they· were elected. The danger facing the All-College Council is not that: it will abuse its ability to take action, but that it will revert· to a long-standing Union tradition of do-nothing student government. This year, due in great measure to the stimu- lation that President Martin has brought to the campus, . the Student Council has passed several measures of great ' importance. But the student body must not rely upon his· lead but must be responsible to continue it themselves. Every member of the All-College Council has an espe- • dally weighty responsibility in this. They, more than any- , one else, must keep alive the spirit of vigorous investiga-: tion and continue the intensive search for even better solu- • tions to the problems facing Union. It is no criticism to · admit the existence of these problems. But the Council member must do more than meekly follow the lead of the,' student body at large. He must understand the general state of opinion and must acquaint the faculty and admin- • istration with it, but he must not make the fatal error of· .conceiving his role as this and little or nothing more. I I I I Friday, April 22, 1 966 Letters To The Editor A.C.C. 's Responsibility To the Editor: A recent editorial brcmght · to rthe front some of the initial problems the All Col.lege •Council will have to f.ace. The statement that the Council should not soft-peddle legislation out of fear of offending trustees expressed a legi.ti- mate point. However, the statement that it will be the Council's function to lead campus opinion, not to follow it, leaves me un- easy. The primary purpose of the A.C.C., as sbated in its charcter, is to serve as a channel of communication for stu- dents, famlty, and administratio11. This statement of purpose cannot be dismissed as voicing the obvious. The point has been made by President M.arti.n and various professors that neither ad- ministra:ti·on nor faculty is really aware of wha.t the students want, for example, in regard to soci-al rule changes. The first job of the representativ-es to the A.C.C. is to make them aware. This means the recently elected representa- tives should reflect opinion as it now exists, not try to change it. If the Coun- cil tries immediately to lead opinion, it may abuse the function {lf making all three e1ements of the college community aware of what the opinioa really is. Art Exhibition The Department of Art has planned an exhi·bition of works done by Union College students to be held in the Gal- lery ·of Art in N ott Memorial from May 7 to May 30. All students on campus who do creative work are invited to sub- mit entries for the exhi-bition. From the works submitted, a two-man jury will select the group of works for the exhibition. In addition, in May, a photography group on campus is plann-ing- a competi- tive exhibition in Old Chapel to run cOJl- curren~ly with the art exhibit. • The representatives from the student body at large, then, should first present the id-e·as of the student body at large (a box: has been set aside i:n the Student Activities Office in which students may leave suggestions te> their representa- tives). After the ideas •of all three ele- ments of the C(}mmunity have been heard (and it should he remembered that the A.C.C. represents faculty <and admini.s- tra tion, as well as students), then per- haps action may be ·taken to lead the campus to better things·. But before leading opinion, pres·ent opinion should he made known. Ben Volirtski Fiii. Dean And I.F.C. To tlte Editor: One weeR day night Iast December, Phi Gamma Delta invited many of the freshmen they were rushing up to their hcmse for dinner with which wine was Sel'ved. Under IFC rules the serving of alcoholic beverages is legal only when it is served at a meal or where the Dean g-ives his specific consent. Atiter dinner t(}asts were proposed and drinldng g>ame.s were played in which studemts who had never been intoxicated before were encouraged to \chug\ 1arge quantities of wine. This went on well into the night in clear violation of both college and IFC statutes, until the wine was exhausted. In North College .South Section al·o1u~ the results .of this party were catastro- phic. One fellow who had never be-en drunk before, Wl'etched for ·an hour, had convulsions and .shivering .spells, ·and fell unconscious bef.ore he could be revived and go to sleep. At least one fight broke out, aU the light ·bulbs on one floor were .broken, ·and fellO'Ws swaggled in all night in variou;s states of inebriations. One freshman ended up in the hospital, and another just did not come back that night. In addition, the night woo wasted for the twenty-five or so freshmen that did not attend the party, as distractions made study impossible. We set out to ruin some ball bearings and failed successful·ly This was reported to the Dean of Students and he gave assurances tharo this matter would be hroll.ghi before the TFC. Last month I checked back with him and he said he had inde€d proce!Sised the complaint. Subseque.ntl:y, rthe IFC Discipline Committee denied they had ever heard anything- about it. I feel this is either a serious bre.ach of trust by someone in a position of authority or a misunderstan4ing of the situation by myself.

This solid lubricant, used a certain way, actually increased the life expectancy of the ball bearings by a factor of ten! Now the motors can run for at least a decade without lubrication.

The careful selection and appli- cation of the proper herbicide is all important to the success of this program. Dr. K. P. Buchholtz of the University's Agronomy staff states that while many weed killers check growth in quackgrass, they do not fully destroy the root re- serves which support new growth and thus do not really eliminate the problem. In states where persistent quack- grass is a problem - Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, northern Indiana and northern Illinois-it can be effectively control.led with Atrazine. He recommends a split application of the herbicide dur- ing the early spring months, first as a pre-rlow application and fol· lowed by a planting-time treat· rnent. A three-step program should be followed: 1. As early as it's possible to get on the land this Spring. apply a broadcast spray of 21.r2 pounds of Atrazine SOW in 2{) gallons of water per acre. Dr. Buchl1oltz recommends that application be made prior to April 1 if possible. 2. \Vait ahout a month after the application before plow- ing. Then plow anu prepare the seedbed in the no1.n:.l manner. 3. At corn planting time (or after planting until weeds are 1 Yz\ high) apply an- other bmadcast sp1·ay of::! 1 2 pounds of Atrazine 80\V. Dr. Buchlmltz likes to aim for no Ia !er than a May 10 planting date in his area, This split application not only gives top-notch conlrol of the quack but also gives contrnl of most annual hroadleaf wceJ~ and gra~~es thmug:h the growing sea- son. Dr. Buchholtz points out thnt it's important to gel pie nty of wa tc r on per acre. He says that it has been his experience thnt between 20 antl 30 gallons per acre have given the most consistent results. It is also important to rernem· her that on corn laud that has received this split application t''taling 5 pounds of Atrazine ROW, tl1e land should again g() into corn the following year. If the farmer is going onto land that has not been cropped for several years-soil bank land, for instance - the agronomist stated that a heavy litter may have accu- mulated. Under these conditions, it is especially important that there be sufficient rainfall to carry the :herbicide down through the trash to the weed germinating zone. The same conditions exist when the 5oil contains a high concentration of organic matter or has a heavy manure cover. ·Young Quarkgrass Plant Some farmers. particularly those who fall pl0w, have had excellent results with applying the :first Atra7ine spray before the fall plowing and the rest at planting time the following spring. Dr. Ruch holtz says. however, that the two spring applications of Atra· :zinc p1·ovide j11~t as good quack- !!rn~s control. \You can't ~ec any difference at all,\ he stated, \For llln~t etTective control, the first application of the Atrazine should l1e made about a month in advance of plowing to weaken and kill the quack before planting time,\ i ,j I I 4 1 ,,

McLister, a senior at Union College, wHI not graduate this Ju.ne b,ecau~e of. a deficienc! in his physical education cre<l.its. He is rtempor- ~mly mact1ve rn the mwntenanee prog-ram due to a knee injury and will not be able to participate for the rest of the year. McLister <:ame to Union as a special student ·in the second ha:lf of the '60-'6U. academtc yea~·· At th.at time the physical education requirement was two years. of mamtenance or the equivalent. Whm he left school and retl.u·ned two years Iate,r~ the :r;equirement had been changed to three years; ye~. he was never n.otlfied of the change or the cons-equences until last sprm(:r, wh.en he received a le~el\ from the Physical Education Department >varnmg h1m that he was ·deficumt one and a half years. Plan Rejected This past winter, he was involved in a siding .accident in whi,ch he injured his knee. Thinking the injury to be less serious than rt was, McLrster saw lVJ.r. Ketz, the Chairman of the Physical Education Depart- ment, and outlined a pla·n in which he was willing t(} workout on an accel- erated level to fulfill his needed requirement. The phm was rejected. After the knee condition grew WOI'Se and MeUstel' found ibhat he would ~ee~ an opera,¥o!!, he w1·o-te le-tters to Mr. Ketz ·and Dean Lockwood, which, m his words, refuted the arguments\ that Mr. Ketz presented. The matter was then placed before the Committee on Student Standing which ruled that the requiremenrts would have to be completed. ''Rehabilitation\ Afiter McLister was released from the hospital following his operation, he appealed his case once more to the committee. Eut this time he had mtdi~9:1 backing from the 'school physic~an, Dr. Car:I'O!l, and the consulting physician, Dr. Nelson, who treated lVIcL1ster from the time of the accident. lVlcLister was turned down again. In the letter from the Committee, he was told that Dr. Nelson had \requested that the completion of your require- ment be such a.s to help you in the reh:a·bihti(}n of your knee.\ This is ex- actly what is not being done, as there is no exception being mad-e in the requirements for a married,. twenty-three year old ·student who has an obvious physical handicap. In h1s conferences with Mr. Ketz, McLister was told that the goal of the maintenance system art Union was to \condition\ the student for three years so that the student would be in the practice of working out on his ~wn initiative during his last year.

Martin and Student Council President Jeffrey Rat- ner presented the new social rules to the student body in a special convoca- tion Monday evening, April 25, in Me- morial Chapel. Approximately 600 student's gave the President a standing ovation after hearing him discuss the new pat- tern of social regulations. President Martin expressed much gratitude to \those who participated actively in the framing of these new rules.\ He em- phasized the point that a residential college, 'such as Union, cannot limit its responsibilities to academic mat- ters, \for it i:s a rounq-the-clock en- terprise,\ and must therefore take into consideration the health and wel- fare of all involved. The President said that in com- munal living there are certain resti'ic- tions necessary, which require a de- gree of \sacrifice and pain,\ and we cannot expect it to be any different at Union. Responsibilities Recalling the radio commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Union Col- lege in 1945, Dr. Martin reminded the student body of the two major respon- sibilities of the faculty and adminis- tration: the perpetuation of Union Col- lege and the recogni<tion of faculty and students who are members of the college at any particular time. With- out considering themselves infallible, the faculty and administration must act, even though the:re may not always bs a happy way of reconciling these two respon'sibilities. Dr. Martin presented to the student body three guidelines concerned \with breaches of order and with violations of spirit .and style.\ Although they axe regulatory, he hopes that they are educative to all involved. Presents Guidelines The first guideline concerned ibself with out obligation to maintain the college's property in at least its pres- ent condition, allowing for normal wear and tear. The second guideline was involved with the storage and use of alcoohc>l. Although the new rules allow for the storage of alcoh(}lic beverages, the college will not \condone drunken- ness\ or permit public drinking out- side fraternities and dormitories. The third and most widely discussed guideline pertained to sexual behavior. Admittedly, the coUege officials are Pres. Martin following nis speecn to the student body. aware of a change in the times, and that \.sexual patterns reflect these ohanges.\ However, Dr. Martin SI!Jated that despite whrut ,some students feel, what goes on in rooms is the concern of .the College. Rsalizing that adoles- cents are extremely complex !human beings, Dr. Martin S'llppo:r.ted this stwtement when he sa.:id \eexual union should be the cubnination of intimacy, based on a deep and oonrtinuing per- sonal relationship .and not a compen- sation f{}r failu:re, a self testing or display of so called virility, nor an aot of rev.enge.\ he said \sexual union should be the culmination of intimacy, based on a deep and continuing personal relation- ship and not a cqmpensatiun for fail- ure, a self testing or display of so called virility, no-r an act of revenge!' An immature or insecure person is liable to easily adapt himself to the behavior pattem which surrounds him. \If vandalism, or drunkcness or sexual license characterize the majority or even those who seem glamorous be- e:aul'e they display thc•ir independence by resisting codes,\ this adoptation can be dangerous. female Role President J.\llartin discussed the fe- male's role in a premarital sexual re- lationship. He added that if a young man loves and respects a girl, he \will not want to subject her to the po'ssi- bility of personality d.amage that a temporary liaison may inflict.\ Dr. Martin then stated that \the College will not condone pre-marital sexual intercourse or devianrt sexual behavior withln its precincts.\ President Martin ended his speech by emphasizing that the business aJlead i·s to implement the new rules and that if all those connected with the college work together, the rules should he effective. Ratner Speaks Following the standing ovation for President Martin, Jeffrey Ratner re- viewed the particular regulations and discussed with the Student Body the content of the social rules which were di·stributed to the audience. Mr. Ratner stressed the importance of personal responsibility in the success of these regulations. Further details of the social regula- tions will be found on page 2.

Bob M,aTshall an<l Bob Win- ner are rthe candidla.tes for seca-e- tary, Discussion to be Varied Points of view will vary g-reatly. Students should be able to gain a good picture o.f the ~thical as well as practical issues involved in war. Mr. Bly, poet and edi't()r of The Sixties, is a vehement critic of J O'hnson, Mac- Namara, Westmoreland, and company. Mr. Kinnell is s·oft-spoken, but in his expel'ience in Asia, Europe, and the Amel'ican South, he has gained a knowledge of the inhumanities prac- ticed by humanity which is often re- vealed in his verse. \The Human Fac·e,\ recently published in Poetry Magazine, displays his knowledge of and compassion for all levels of men. James Wright, auth(}r of Saint Judas, in which the damned traitor commits a gratuitous, decent act, is a straight from the hip poet who has dealt with such topics as the death of CheBsman, the life of criminals, the life of the illiterate and uncared-for poor, and the small tragedies of even the most insignicant life. Union Participates The read-in will be moderated by David Wiecks, professor of philosophy at RPI. Union faculty members Who will certainly .be participating are Mal- colm Willison, Sociology, and Bruce Clemens, English. Rod Tulloss, '66, wiii also take part. It is hoped that members of the (}Utside community will attend as well as students from local colleges. This read-in at Union is the first of three scheduled O'll May 5. The others are at SUNY, :Binghamton, and at Cornell. Sharon Walker Poet Galway Kinnell will toke part in o \Read in'• at Union next week. Curtis To Lead BeethovenNinth Conductor Edgar Curtis will make his final appearance a's musical direc- tor of the Alhany Symphony Orches- tra during a concert in Memorial Chapel on Tuesday, May 3rd, at 2:30 P.M. He will be succeeded by Julius Hegyi, former conductor of the Chat- tanooga Symphony. The combined glee clubs of Mary- mont College and Union College will also perform Brucker's \Te Deum\ and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the lat- ter under the direction of Union's As- sociate P1·ofessor of Music, Hugh Allen Wilson. Students will be admitted at no cost. Tenure Ends The Schenectady concert will mark the cl()se of the symphony's season and the end of Curtis's tenure as con- ductor and musical direct(}r of the or- che·stra. Profeossor of Music at Union, Mr. Curtis is resigning after 16 yea:rs as conductor {}f the Albany Symphony, in order to devote all his time to two newly fo.rmed groups, the Northeast- ern New York Student Orehestra, which i-s a high school-college organ- ization, and a chamber orchestra called the Northeastern New York Philhar- moni-c.

2 Friday, April 29, 1966 NEW SOCIAL RULES: START OF AN ERA . . Martin Sets Guidlines Editor's Note: The following at•e excerpts fmm President Martin's speech given :.\Ionday concerning the new social regulations. The purpose of tMs meeting is to present and discuss the new pat- tern of social rules developed this year by joint consultation of students, faculty, .a.nd administrative officel's. I ha\'e expressed elsewhere, and w:i.BJJ. to repeat here, my satisfaction with what has he en so far accom- pHshed .... Two Responsibilities A good 1·esidential college should improve the quality of life for those who lin' in it, and it should. at the same time refine their values. The restrictiuns necl'ssary to communal liYing do sometimes entail frustra- tion; their enforcement is both a nuisance and. a headache. But any ord-er of civilization is bought at the cost of sacrifice and pain, and we cannot expe<.>t that the civilization we create here will be any different in that respect .... Freshman here will remember hearing last fall a somewhat senti- mental but rather affecting record made at the time of the 150th anni- versary of Union College, in 1945 at the very crise·s of World Wa.t· II. They may remember hearing the president at that time, Dixon Ryan Fox, say, \Union College was here a long· time before you came. It will be here a long time after you are gone.\ That statement sums up one of the two major responsibilities the faculty and the administration must assume: the perpetuation of Union College. The second major responffi- bility 1s to t.hose who are members of the college at any particular time. The faculty and administration cannot ignore either, and they cannot ulways find happy ways to reconcile the two, so they d(} what human be- ings always have to do - make the best accommodations that their limited wisdom permits .... Even so, we hope that you will find ways to manage most communal activities y,ourselves and that you wiU find the broad guidelines I shall present a broad reinforcement for your own best measures of the good life on Union College Grounds .... Three Guidelines 1'he first guideline concerns vandalism ... We are obligated, allow- ing for normal wear and teaT, to pass [college property] on to others in c•ondition at least as good as we found it .... The second guideline concerns alc(}h(}l and other stimulants. As you know, the law restriC'ts sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages to thnse- e-ighteen years of age or older. It explicitly prohibits, without authorization, the \Rale and consumption of narcotics and narcotic-like drugs, including marijuana and hallucinogens. We intend to resped and t'nforce the law .... The new sorial rules ... do not condone drWlken- ncss, either sporadic or chronic, and those who abuse this pl'ivilege ex- tendE'd will be subject to discipline, up to and including suspension .... The third guideline, and the- one mo:st discussed, has to do with sexual t·onduct .... You have asked for the privilege of entertainiBg guests in your rooms, and you now have it, subject to hour limits intended to pro- tect the privary and need for quiet of the whole community. Some of you have argued that what goes on in private rooms should not be the con- cern of the College; r have argued that it is and \\r:ill continue to be .... I should like to suggest that one aspect of this. problem too little con- sidered-a·s it is for the other two problems I have S]}oken of-is that of imitation and contagion. The fact that The College becomes a defining environment for you while you are here means that, both in obvious and in subtle ways, it conditions you .... Hopeful The College will not condone premarital sexual intercourse or deviant sexual behaviour, within its precincts. As for other breaches Gf the com- munity welfare, offenders will be subject to di'scipline up to and including sugpension. T. S. Eliot once wrote a review of some Goergian poetry which he callPd \as dull as a rural Sunday ·sermon.\ You rn::ty feel the same 1\·ay a,bout these remarks. They were \Yritten on Sunday, I must admit. Dull OJ' not, I hope they are clear·. The necessity to spell out official policy will not. I trust obscure the general purpose of it or in any way diminish the g-ood affects we hope \\\ill fo·llow from the new social rules. The busine>ss ahead is to make them work weU, and to use them as a base for more imag-inative and more rewarding life in the College. No gr9up, can do that alone; together, I am confident we shall succeed. For three Generations • Those Who Know Have been recommending - HERSHEL MAURICE B. WALTER Maurice B.

In the fiims bqoks and television s·hows of the la&t six yea~ (at the least), the Gei'm-an is portrayed as a nice .average farm-boy from the mid-west of Germany who was drafted. The American soldiers are fro~ the mid-west U.S.,. soda-jerked hef.ove the war and like the \nice\ German soldiers. This method of forgiving recently mainfested i·tself on tele- vision, in the form of a show called \Hog\~an',s Heroes,\ where the Germans .are as lovable as ·the Allies, and ·the S.S. is ju.st .a btmch -of \silly :tiool- ish, young boys, who strayed from their m~tilier's side.\ Stark Realism Those films and hooks, which appeared directly after the war, aTe the complete antithesis of the trend of making everybhing appear gmy. They are ·stark in their realiosm, portraying the German as a brutal, ruthless and totally amoral creature. \Open City\ is ju-st such a realistic fiim. It was made in Re>me, juSit ·after the Allies libemted fue citty, in 1944. It is a tale of the Italian resistance movement and is, though not CD-nsciously, an attempt to res·tore Ibalioan :self-pride. Resistance The theme of the movie i·s the resistance of oppressed men, against their OPJ)l'essw.s. This theme, . made under different circumstamces and \Vith aU the Holly,v.ood touches, usually results in a trtte and. boring _ two hours. Directed with the masterful hoand· of Roberto RoaselHni, Anna Magnani and Aldo Fa~brizi do bril!Lant j·obs. V Cilliant Priest The story, for the rnost part, center•s around a parish priest, Don Pietro (played by Aldo Fabrizi). Don Pietro is hiding weapons and re- sistance workers .and is g·etting hel'P in his illegal activiUes from the children of the parish. The priest is turned. over rbo the Gestape> and shot. Among the other characters is the Gestapo ma- jor, who talks -~bourt; German \cultur.e\ !ll!l'ld; .shows a genuime lov·e for his work. The O!ther GeS!bapo. leader, a leshi.an, entices 'alll actres·s to betray her lover, by giving her gifts. A terrifying .scene fol- lQWS, when the Gestapo agent comforts ij;he actress tenderly, while her Jover is brutally ibearben in the next room. Cold and Brutal If one were to .find foault with the film, it would He in the f•act that it portrays tme Gerunans as cold and brutal and in this respect may be unlreaHstic. Regardless, the film still comes out as a powerf<ul ce>m1errmation of Germ:an brutality, during the war. Wb•aJt makes the film :fascinating is that in sl)i:te of th·e conditions it was made unde1•, it still came out as one of .the best Italian films, made up to that time. The was made in the chaos of ju&t-lioherated Rome and Rosse!Hni, used very few profesisO'Ilal actor.s. Magrua1li, at that time, was a night-dub ·singer, Faibrizi was a comedian and the boy, who was the leader of thoe children, was a b()lotbl'ack. The film, as -a whole, is bru:bal, 'sometuues sick- ening, terrifying and occasi.ona!ly humorous. On the who~e, irt; is Oone of the best films to come out of the period, diTectly after the war. It will be shown on Friday nig.h:t, in E.E.22 at 7:00 and 9:00. Raja Rao during an informal interview discusses various aspects of the novel form and its rele- vance to allegorical content. By Pa11l Sherwin I was fortunate to have been present at a quite informal luncheon during which Mr. Raja Rao freely discussed many of the significantt issues with which he, as writer-philosopher, has at- tempted to come to terms in his fiction. l{eaders in his 0¥-'TI country find it hard lo understand the curious intermingling of Indian and Western thought which unlerlies the sr.eculative content of his novels and stori<Jos, wh1le readers in the West, taking for granted varillus lite1·a.ry fllrms and modes of thought that Mr. Rao has come to absorb into the inherited Hindu basis llf his think- ing, tend to see him as a peculiarly Indian phe- nomenon. In truth, Mr. Rao's philosophi.cal stance seems a fundamentally Indian one; and the W c.st- ern writers from whom he has learned - Gide, Malraux, Dostoievski, Rilke- are primarily spec- ula-tive authors, men whose thought might readily be contained within a broad metaphysical frame- work. Metaphysical Bent It is always difficult to assess the meaning or, more properly, the various levels o·f interpretation and density of texture of any author who has a distinctly metaphysical bent; and when we are confronted by a thinker such as Mr. Rao who.se :world encompasses both Eastern and West- ern tradition the problems of evaluatiQn and un- derstanding become increasingly more evident. Mr; Rao has written that \the Indian novel can only be epic in form and metaphysical in nature.\ His writing assumes the shape of allegx>ry, of a story within a .st(}rY' in <>rder to show that all stories are parables. The epic scope of the novel comes from the various levels - the .social, the political, the amorous, etc. - which he feels must comprise the subje.ct of a work of fiation. The writer of fiction must be a truth-teller, a philoso- pher, who is able to perceive and comprehend the true essence of 'his world. But not o-nly mu.st the writer contain all these elements of Ms world wi.thi!n an epic-scope; he must also be able to bring together wha-t may seem disparate factual exi.stence.s through his metaphysical perception. It is in thi:s sense that wdting truly becomes the province of the Platonie seer-philosop.her. Metaphor is Central The Indian thinker, according to Mr. R111o, sees all facts in terms ·of allegory. Meba:phor is therefore c-entral in his works; for metaphor is the palltieular vehicle by which allegory is ex- pressible. In a novel such as The Cat And Shakes- peare Mr. Rao has said that \all gestures, all words, have absolute meaning.\ Usha, daughter {)f the narrator RamakrLsh:a Pai, assumes th-e po- siti·on of Child in the allegorical sense, while Pai's wife, Shantha, is Mother-Woman. Al!though most critics have pointed QUt that the \Gat\ of the title is referential to the Indian proverb that rthe soul must cling to God as a kitten to its mother, few have understood the relevance of \Shapespeare\ here. As the \Gat\ represents the Absolute, that foT which all individual souls must strive, so does \Shakespeare since Mr. Rao believes that Shakespeare was a man who had :a !];rue apprehen- sion of the Absolute. Otherwise,. he could noi have been Shakespeare. Moreover, the various threads of allegorical interpretation come :together when we look at Keats• famous l-etter in which he dis- cusses \negative capability.\ Not ()nly is Shakes- peare discussed here, but there is als.o mention of a kitten jumping upon a stool which is made to refer to the Absolute. Incident and plot in such metaphysical works as The Cat And Shakespeare und The Serpent (Il- lusion) And The !tope (Heality) are totaJ.ly su:IJ- sumed hy uUeg-ory, lt i::> vnly in their participa- tion m the AbsolUte that the charaaters and their expeJ•ien.ces take on meaning. AU words, all images, aecording to :.\1r. !tao, aJe followed by \.SJlenee\ (perceytion of the Absolute), hut the reverse is not true. The great wnter communi- cates his 1mportant trutns only tlucough his silences,. the feeling conveyed lUter the word it- self is spol\en or read. 1 found it part1cuarly interesting that he considers the Symposium of Plato IJernaps the most pm·fect novel ever writ- ten because the form is dictated .wlely by the thougll t hehind it. Mr. Rao, who is acutely conscH>us of establishing an Indian form for the novel, IS very much concerned with tlus relation- ship between the form of fiction and the thought wh1ch inspires it. lt is for t.hat reason llhat he feels ·the Indian novel must 'assume a shape en- tirely un-W.estern, a shape which might l'efiect the indian metaphysical .spirit. Admires Philosophers :Mr. .Rao calls himself a classicist. He is par- ticularly interested in Plato whose idea of Shade and Light (though no•t that of the Forms) seems to him much akin to Hindu thought. Other Wes.t- ern prulos()phers whe>m he greatly admll'e<J and consl·del'S in ·the Platl)nic tradJtJon ai'C Abelard, l'lotinas (who was influenced by Indian philoso- phy) and Buelheus. 'lhese medievalists, Mr. Rao feels, were men who were passionately ce>ncerned with the attainmerut of the Absolute; and in con- jun~tion with this he see-s a real similarity be- tweet! the Catlwlic conception of an ornnipz·e~ent .sainth0ootl and Lhe Hindu idea of man seekmg his own end. In all these traditions knowing you.r individual self first is .all import.an.t. Jewish Question Mr. ·Rao is such .an iruteresting man and ~s know ledge111ble in so many areas, that it is in- deed irnp.ossible to cons~der even summarily .all the subjects which his eloquence encompass·ed within tne space of th1s brief interview. I W'llls very much fascinated with his belief that if th.e Jews under Hit1er had embraced a mode of acti-on similar to non-violenL-e they might have d~ed with more dignity even if it were not possihle to have prevented their slaughter. However, he feels, if the Jews really did accept their fate as a mamlatoe f1•om God that acceptance in itself wa.s a noble a.nd beautiful thing. Communism was an- other to]!ic about which Mr. Rao was quite vocal . The philO\sophy e>f life, the ideal expre·ssed by the Marxists, is, in Mr. Rao'.s Q•]!inion, a striving f·or the AIJ,solute, but in taking materialism before spiritualism in order to achieve thwt ultimate end the Communists have fai.led and will continue 1;{) do so: for it is just a ca:se of taking the cart before the horse. We art Union have been .indeed honQred to have had a thinker of such ernminenee as Mr. Rao on campll!s for the past two weeks. Let up hope that w.e will be in store for more such experi- ences (and not ten or twelve years hence, may I add).

It .coll!si!Sts of fourbeen es•says covering a wide I!aalge •of topics. Of these perhaps the two mast imporllanJt are on the sub- ject .of· the historiool and theoretical aspects of Hindu art. The central theme here is lbhe ·search for truth. Austeri,ty is equated wiJth passion, ly:ric and reHgi!O'Ils expecrj.ence me fused. The doctrines of the Atm.an or se1f come in Jto hear, for poetry is seen as a direct contribtuion to the aims of life. The po~ is verry much the servant of his poert;ry'. Since the wor.d i!tself Is ~Sacred, the poet is oper- ating in a religious mediu-m. It is not surprising then that the greate.st In- dian poets are the ,sa,ges. The eon- ternplart;ive nature of Indian pootry makes fQr grace a,nd <liglri!ty. A-esthe- tic expression on its own i:s held to be meaningle&s uJ1le<ss it becomes an act of worship. Theve is a long discussion -on Raj-a, the essential ele- ment in poetry, and on th-e nature of beauty The Olth.ar ess-ays in \The Dance of Shiva\ are upon music, the ·dance and a1so upon various sociologicllil f:lopioo, sucll as the status of Indi•an women in society. Mr. CoomaroSWMny hoa:s brought together •here •a fine collec- tion of brief illum!nating e&says. TW.s is •a book to be highly recommended to anyone just heginning to g€11; to grips with Indian art and culture. Visual Art Theory \The History of Indian Art\ is writ- ten by th'l! ·sa:me author .as \The Dance of Shiva.\ It is a very clear, concise readable book. It is hardly compre- hen·sive enough in scope to be of ,a;~Tiy value as a re:Derence book, but this is n~t its function. Rath-er it serves as a })'ractical •introduction to the visual arts in Inclia as the othe1• hook deals more with theory. Mr. Cooonar- aswamy concentrates mainly upon architecture >and s·culpture; however, painting, pottery, jewelery, metalwork an<i weaving are also discussed.

Down to Louis•, let us go, lently 'ltnnotaJted and indexed. The book also includes a section almost as Long as the text itself of semito-ne plates many of which are full page size. The author is very well v.erS€d in the history and phi!Qsophy of both Eastern and Western cultures, and presents his subjeat here in a way which is ea;sy for the Western reader to grasp. Dover books hav·e again in this case kept up :th-eir high standard of pNJ- ducrt;ion. The clear type face and the quality ·of the plates make this an \·art-book\ in the very best sense of the word. Tndian Shakespeare Kalidiasa is to Indi•an poetry and drama what Shakespeare is to Eng- lish writing. Like Shakespeare there exrsts very little biogllaphical detail for him. We know li!J;tle more than that he lived and wrote in the fifth years then, 'he has been acknowledged as the genius of the Indiran drama. This collection includes, wiVh other ·poems and plays, Shakurutala, luis masterpiece for the theatre. The pl<lt of the play is based on an ancien!; Indi,an J.egend. King Du.shy;an,ba falls in love with Shakunrt;aJ.a, a serving- girl who is in fact orf noble birth. They live together for a while ·aJLd he promise•s to marry her.

Circulation Manager Excellence or Coercion Union College, inundated as it is in bureaucracy (with one big dean, two medium deans, a little dean, an assistant dean, ten directors of various worthy projects, and a Committee on Student Standing), has been able to totally lose sight of the primary reason for its existence: to benefit the student. In the case of Dan McLister, it has allowed sterile rules and an apparently unreasoning and automatic ac- C€ptance of an absurd program. for the Body-Beautiful to over-ride more important criteria. There is no question that M:cLister has not fulfilled the forn~.al requireme~ts for gr_aduation concerning ~hysic!'ll education. There IS some eVIdence that he has at trmes m the past been something less than the model student. Nev- ertheless, the circumstances in the case warrant that an exception be made concerning his graduation requirements. We do not know the reasons behind the administra- tion's action as it refused to ce>m.ment. But judging from the facts we do have, it seems to be based upon a strict interpretation of the rules. And this is exactly what a small colleg~ must ~voi~. Unable to compete in the breadth of acadermc offermg, 1t must be willing to give more attention to the needs of the individual as an individual, not as a number to be ruled by rigid and unbending rules. Thus, it mlll?t us~ rules as ~des only, never as the last word. Inherent m this concept IS the willingness to disregard the possibility that the incident might be used as a precedent in some later case. If each case is decided upon its i.IJ.dividu.al me:its, precedent w_ill be important only as a gwde to what IS proper, and thiS, surely, is not something to be feared. Beyond the importance to the individu~, this c~ has significance as an example of the problems inherent m the gym program as it now stands. Primary is the rigidity it shows concerning medical excuses. It is absurd to refuse to accept any excuse for missed classes. In McLister's case, his doctor has plainly told the college that he is not to attend gym. Yet, he is still expected to attend or to forfeit his diploma. Perhaps there are doctors who would be less than objective in granting exemption, but surely this is less a pri.ce for the college to pay than to perpetrate an injustice such as the one dis- cussed here. But beyond this is the entire concept of forced phy- sical education. Mr. Ketz has admitted to us that there is a large percentage of Union men who are both physically fit and interested in athletics, the two goals of the program. He further admitted that it was administratively possible to determine these students. It seems obvious that the con- clusion from this should be that these students should be exempt from the requirement, just as they are from -Eng- lish or Physics upon proving that they have fulfilled the goals of those courses. Y.et the Department of Physical Education has refused to do this. It relies upon force to fill its courses, know- ing full-well that the present program would be empty without coercion. The instruction courses, which should be the strongest part of the program, are woefully over- crowded and the quality of instruction is shoddy and inept. .And this is where change must occur. If the college wants to make a real contribution to the health of the students here. it can be done. But it will have to eliminate the present reliance upon force rather than excellence. Good Start It was gratifying to see the fine turn-out for last Mon- day's student meeting. President Martin's speech was elo- quent and to the point. We hope that he will change his position on the rights of the individual to determine his own standard of behavior insC>far as it does not infringe upon the rights of others. But the present start, which shows restraint and respQnsibility in those involved, is promising Friday, April 29.;. .1966 .Jazz: Tenor Sax By Clifford Safane Letters· To Volinski Replies The Editor During the hop and post bop era, the tenOT sax ha:s become one of the most popular instru- ments used in jazz. Yet wi,th the great nu-mber of rtenorists on the scene, there are only a few who have come to be c:on- sldered major innovators on theh- instrument. John Col- trane, Sonny Rollins, and Stan Getz are perhaps the mos.t im- portant terrorists of the .period, but since Coltrane has. already been discussed ln previous a,r- ticl~s, we wil1 focus our atten- tion on the other two men. · To the Editor: Dave McNally, Jo•hn Miller and Jim Palmer J>.ut the z·e~l strength. of :the staff lies in the bullpen. Stu Miller a:nd Dtck H{l)ll are as capable firemen as any in the league. This staff, i ilh.ink -wor.lld qualify as being adequa-te under .anyone~~ stand- ards, even Mr. Grayson'.s if he would ;bake tirne to invest!gate before he wrote. Rollins, '(JD!e ,of tod,ay's mu- sicians whom I conside1' to be a genius, made his fi11st record- ing with Bud PoweU in 194:8. Although he showed a strong Charlie Parker infl.uenee at the time, Rollins still h:ad some- thing of his o\vn to say. The tenorist incorporated a hard tone and vi~lent attack in his playing. This cause-d Rollins ·to have a forceful instead of melodic style which was the popular way of tenor playing. But it Wlas not until the mid- dle 50's' that Rollins full'Y be- came an individualistic pJ.ayer. In additicm to his f,Qorceful at- tack, Rollins now pJ.aY'ed in a more jagged -style. He aiso em- ployed honks and vocal cries in his impr~visations whtoh great- ly hightened the emotional in- tensity of hiJs 'P1ay. When de- scri-bing Rollins'.s •style of this periGd a critic in Dmvnbeat said that the tenorist was in- terested in \the unifying of an improvisation .through a de- velopment s-ense of emo-tion!al urgency rather than through a strict melodic flow.\ \Ee-Ah\ An excellent examp:e of Rol- lins's' work from this period is a blues entitled· \Ee-Ah from his album Sonny Boy Prestige 1297). The tenori.srt plays in such a direct manner that his jagged and }orceful attack ce>mpletely overwhelms the listener. It is quite an ex- citing performance. Stan Getz is a.nOither t<lnor sax player who came iruto his own durlng the 50's. Getz is considered to be one of the masters of bhe baUad, and now, the bossanova (although I be- lieve that he spemds too much of his time playing Ute latter). Unlike Rollins, Getz empl,oys a sof·t tone and a mtil:odic style. Listen to him p~ay his now famous version of \Des-afinado\ fro-m Jazz Samba (Verve 8432). Hel!e. Getz spins out l·ong phrases in an effortless man- ner and -thus creaies a peace- ful and serene mQood. Although most of Getz•-s pa.p- ularity is due rto his p1aying tthe bossanova, :the tenol\ists i-s n01t necessarily tec:hnieaUy lim- ited to playing it exclusively. Getz can play fast tunes quit€ well. In an album Y~ecorded live a:t a Jazz at the Philharm.O'Ilic concert entitled Stan Getz:J. J. Johnson, At the Opera House (Verve 8490) he pJ;ays with the fire and heat that 1s unf'Ortun- ately sometimes missi'Ilg from his oresent work. \On \Billie'es Bounce.\ for exampl•e, Getz plays C'hor1,1;s after chorus of driving hnprov1sations with limitless imagination a.nd ease. The listener can only marv-el at hearing the terrorist play so much moving mus-ic with such seemingly little effort. Contrasting Styles Stan Getz and Soll'lly Rollins are only two of the maJor tenor players o-f the bo)l and p(}s:t bop era. Eut ihey best symbo- lize the co.ntv!llsting styles of the period. Whether the future tenorists of the .av,arut garde fol.low the lead of either mu- sician •or bmh, I do not know. (At th·e moment, hO'Wever, the avant gardists seem to be en- corporating s,ome of Rollins'.s elements in thcir style - i.e. vocal effeets' and har.sh tone. But their greatest inflwence seems to be John Coltrane). We ca.n only wait to find out. Chariot's Comin More American servieemen we1•e killed in eombat in the first 3:1h months of 1966 than were kilie-d there in all of 1965. Defense Department figures show 1,427 men killed through April 16, while the combat toll f<or 1965 l'ltood at 1,365. The to.tal number killted in combat since Jan. 1, 1961, :ha~ :reached 3,047. I bel~eve your editori'<lil was b!liSed on a mis- undeMtanding of the point of my letter, a mi.s• understanding _ pQos>sibly caused by my overem- phasizing the idea I ·was :trying to convey. I wd stmoo ilbat the All College Council should follow existing opinion in th.e sense that they should 'be aware oof it. However, the inference that the G<lUJJ- cil should do nothing but follow opinion is heli~d by my statement that, after becoming aware of opinion, the Council may indeed lead the colJece to bette1· things. If I overemphasized the wor=as. of the Charter of the A.C.C., I hope it wasn't a. fatal error. Orioles Oversight To the Editor: Ben V t~linski Anyone who knows .anY\thing at all about base- baH realizes that one p-:itcher does not make 'bhe difference betwee,n a pennant contender •and a. sec- ond divisi.on club, un:les.s <>f couvse the p]tcher is Sandy Koufax. Contrary to this, Mr. Grayson contends that the Baltimore Or1oles do n-ot have an adequate pitching ·Staff ·simply becaus'e th.ey have t1•aded away MU.t Papp•as. If Mr. GraY'son will stop to look ,at the statiist.1ce he will discover that, although Pappas is un- d~nirubly a {l'(}od pitehe.r, he has neveT come up w1th a great season and has never pitched Bal•ti- more to a .:Pe~ant. I:f Mr. Grayson will look fur- ther, he w11l d1scov-er that Pappas regularly incurs some so1t of minor injury necessitating mils$ing sevet·al :starts every .seaso-n, and has a repuootinn of being a. \six-inning;• .pitcher. Oll!e look at the Orroles pitcher roster would show ,thwt the men they have now are •basically the same m~n :that }litched the Ori'Oles to iihJTd place last year.

More studernt iruter- est would give a sense of pu.rp:ose to student ·organiz.ation. Once thi.s \sta- bility\ is attained, \integration\ of activities may be achieved, partially through the efforts of the .A!ll College Council. Pinson, a member of the Class of '67, has serv:ed on the Student Council for two years, the Student Tax: Com- mittee for one year, and has been a class officer. Kilburn Leaving For Post As DeanJ Patrick E. Kilburn, assodate professor of English at Union College, has been selected as new Dean of the Faculty at Monticello College in Godfrey, IU. His appointment was announced this month by Mo.nticello President Jo·lln R. Haines. Before he became President of the two year college for women in 1'!)64, Dr. Haines had been assistant to Union President Carter Davidson. NDEA Dr. Kilburn will begin serving at Monticello next fall. He· will be tEach- ing this summe1· at Union under the National Defense Educational Act. The N.ElEA, sponsored hm·e in conjunction with Albany State, will .provide special instr.uction for high school English teachers. The Act was established on a national basis one year ago, and this is the first year Union will .participate in the program. On Leaving Prof. Kilburn is \intrigued with the problems of women education' and looks f01ward to this new experience. He does not, however, leave Union without regret: \My experience at :Union has been a satisfying and fruitful one and I Te- gL•et leaving the friends I have made here. U11ion is an excellent college, and under President Martin it is going to he a better one.\ A 1944 graduate .of the L.Tnhtersity of New Mexico, Prof. Kilburn took his doctorate in English at New York University in 1954. He joined the Union College faculty the 'same year. Webster the Third In 1962 Prof. Kilburn attracted wide notice as a leading defender Q:f the Webster's Unabridged Third Edition, which had been attacked for its (jlj}egedly permissive attitude in matters of English usage. His article on the dictio11ary, appearing in the Union ·College Symposium, was one of the earli-est full-sc-ale .defenses of the dictionary and led to a televi'sion debate with Dwight MacDonald, a leading attacker. The written exchange between Kilburn and MacDonald was The Gatestnen are now accepting later republished in Dictionaries and That Dictionary, a book about the con- applications for membership. troversy.

TAIW~N Concordy Sports Page 4 EAST-WEST Page 3 Garnet Beats Orange In Lacrosse, Ephmen In Baseball By Steve Cheuvront Hobart ended 'l'nion's winning· streak at three games on Tuesday by defeating the Garnet 12-!1. The win was the first in four games for H<>bart, while the loss evened Union's record at 3-3. After defeating Norv:ich on. the road 7-6 last week, the Garnet retut·ned home to face Rochester and Williams during Senior Week- end. Behind the fine pitching- · of Albany Pharmacy's Gene Hoerning and the clutch hitting of Greg Olson, the Garnet defeated Rochester a-2. The following day was almost a repeat performance as the Garnet defeated a tough Williams club 6-3. Bill Neidel went the distance on the mound as he picked up his first vdn of the season. This is the first win for the nine over the Purple since 1957. Hollerrback vs. Hobart Shooting for four in a row, Coach Lawrence nominated lefty Bob Hallenbeck to pitch against Hobart. For the first six innings Hallenbeck looked superb, seattel'ing six hits, while not allowing a run to score. The offense was highlighted by back-to-back triples by Bill 'foth and Greg Olson in the three run third inning, and a two r-un tt'iple · to deep left field by D a ve Hourigan in the sixth. To Err is Union Jn the seventh inning, h.ow.ever, the roof fell in on the Garnet, as the visitors pushed across seven runs on only three hit's. A double, an error, a sing·le and another error scored one run before an infield out put one away. An E!t-ror:, a passed ball and a walk scored two more rum and loaded the bases. When Hallenbeck•s own error let in another run, Coach Lawrence brought in Gene Hoerning. Hoeming was greeted with a run scoring single and the rest of the runs scored on his own two ermrs. 9th Inning Garnet Edge Union still held a 9-8 edge in the top of the ninth after trading runs with Hobart in the bottom . of the seventh and the top of the eighth. In the ninth, an enor and a single brought in Chuck CresS- well in relief of Hoerning. A. fielders choice which failed to get any- one out loaded the bases and aU scored as the Garnet came up with two errors on the same play-. Cresswell let in the twelfth and final r-un with a wild pitch. This game will probably go down in history as one of the poorest played games ever . Twelve errors, including three by third baseman Pizzica and two earh for · Hoerning and Chet·inko plus numerous mis- cues which even the Mets \\\outd not think of pulling, cost Union a sure victol'y. If L'niun i:; to \i 11, it i,; ob\'ious that they must get a bettet· defense. Today the Gamet test the HamHton nine at Hamilton and then tt·avel to RPI for a game on Tuesday.
