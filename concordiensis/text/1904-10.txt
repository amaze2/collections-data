T ' HE CoNCORDIENSIS [JNJOJV ·COLLE·GE, OCT. I, T904. .1\lo. 2 REVERED PRESIDENT EXTOLLED Union's Sons From Every Quarter Meet to H.onor the Memory of Dr. Nott-Eulogies of Noted Alumni. From every section of our count·ry hundreds of alnmni gathered in Old Union's hall's lC!-st Thurs- day in h0nor of the Grand Old Man of the .institu- tion-Dr. Eliphalet N ott, the most eminent presi- dent of 1 he college. The event of the accession of D1~. N ott to the presidency of ·union College took place one hun- drt>cl years ago; and no n1ore fitting and greater esteem paid to his sterling qualities as a man anct ::t te~~::her conld have been shown than by the cer- emonies attendant upon the unveiling of the tablet to his men1ory jn the N ott Me1norial Hall. The progran1me of the day's events began at 10:15 when the hundreds of guests including the alumni, trustees, faculties arid undergraduates . gather erl at Washburn Hall. The slight sprinkle of rain dirl not dan1pen the ardor of the under- graduate classes, who sent the echoes rolling across the can1pus with their vanous yeHs. Students from the Albany Law and Medical · Schools swelled the University representation. After some delay, the undergraduates fonneci _in parallel lines on either side of the lane leading from \Vashbnrn 'Hall to the N ott L·ibrary, and the pn,cess1on n1arched to the latter place, in the fol- lowing- order: Guests, speakers, trustees, faculties, alnmni, seniors, sophotnores, fre shn1en, Albany lv1echcal students, Albany Law School students. The in1pressjve exercises in the Library building were opened by the singing of the I 17th Psalm. The speakers of the day were seated on a tempo- ' . ra ry platf onn erected beneath a life-size painting of Dr. N ott, <1nd the capac1ous hall was crowded . v to its full capacity, a 1noderate estimate placing the nnn-rber present at eight htindred. After the singing of the psalm, prayer was offered by Dr. Horace Silliman to whon1 Dr. An- derson had conceded the honor, as a personal friend of Dr. N ott. President Raytnond delivered the unveiling speech, a 1nodel of eloquent tribute to the presi- dent of 2. century past, and introduced to the as- sem.i;lage EEphalet N ott, the direct descendant of the noted educator who withdrew the veil from the tablet atniclst a tremendous ovation frotn the audience. Fallowing a musical interlude, addresses on Dr. N ott as a n1an, a preacher and an educator, were delivered respectively by the Ron. F. W. Seward, the Rt. Rev. 11. C. Potter, and the Hon ]. S. Lan- don. introduced by President Raymond. Dr. Nott's various phases were thoroughly discussed, and his true worth under ~very condition justly lauded by the speakers. After the college song had been sung, benedic- tion was pronounced and the crowd dispersed for a short ti1ne. THE COLLATION. At I :,10 p. 1n., the New York State Annory be- cmne the center of attraction for the hungry multi- tuclf~. lT nder the 1nanage1nent of the ladies of Schenectady a banquet had been prepared for the thousanC. guests. who, after indulging 1n the tetnpt- ing viands set before them, were regaled by ren1i- nt~renct>.s of Dr. N ott delivered bv his forn1er students: \tVilliam H.

THE CONCORIJJENSIS. 1ng, his facf: gentle and at the san1.e tinte grave. rl\he lllOSt strikiHg peculiarity of :his re1narkable character was his knowledge. He was, like Franklin, n1any sided. At. the age .of 30 he had reached the front rank in his chosen profession, tl1e cle1·gy, and turned to other fields of activity when he achieved greater en1inence as an in- structor and cC>Hege pr,esident. His achieve1nents in the line of hn:-ention were nutnerous, the N ott stove, the prog-enitor of all base burning stoyes beC'ame at once f<.tn1otts. ''P11ysical infinnity finally prevented his attend- ::tnce: to the duties of President, but his mind re- rnained clear to the last. At go he was still young and ~nany H'll.l·eJnl)cr the good that he did during his 62 years of service to the college.\-Hon. Freclerick \iV. Seward. * * * * \'Ine history of college life, a century ago, was a l1istory of fn·qt:ent expulsions; and when President N ott took in these scholastic vagrants, as, some- tinlt'~ he did, he wrt.s objurgated as influenced by unworthy n1otives, or, guilty of professional dis- loyalty. \Nothing i ~ fi ncr in his history than his serene self-restr::tint undE.:r tl1ese base a:nd infan1ous in- sinuations. B::tse and infan1ous they were; but he knew that tl1c honest and stupid men who n1acle them could nvt percrive that. He had recognized what, thank God, 111ost of us ha:ve now con1e to recogniLe-thrlt, in dealing \vith hutnan nature, and espeC'ia11y witl:: young hutnan nature, we tnust be careful to di::~tingt1ish between depravity and way- wanblE::SS. We do it with horses, and a wise n1an will do it with boys! [t was this jn President Nott's speech and con- duct, alike, that tnade him supremely a preacher of righteousness. Whether in that great sennon on the death of Hatnilton, or in his college study \-vhen he is dealing with a wayward student, he points out the departure from the path of right- doing whether to a nation or of a single youth, he forevr.r marries hope to warning, and encour- ao·enlent to rebuke. We turn fron1 our tnore bust- <. I::> 0\'$ sun1. of all these, .an acute judge o·f hutnan nature and a \vise practical refonner. Learning for the rner~e purpose of absorbing the teachings of others had iess attracbou for hin1, but learrting or knowl- edge of whatever kind which stin1ulated his reflec- tion artd gaye h.itn the n1aterial fron1 which he cou1;d. e-x tract use'ful truths, or w hkh he could r~e­ cast into the truth:, never lost its charn1. He :fi11ed his tnind with wisdotn ra:ther than learning and wrnno·ht out in his own brain n1ore than the text ~ h(10ks con1d teach. \Dr. N ott, hin1self, was a practical physicist, ex- peri~nenter and inventor-he secured: twenty-six patents upon his different inventions-of course he realized the valne of learned and practical experts as instructors. \N a t11re n1nulded him large with aptness for g::tthering wisdom, strength and grace frotn every- thi:lg within l1is horizon. He knew hitnself, and loved the people, and wrought wisely to serve tht:ln well. lie 1ived in that ennobling age when the 2.spiration of generously gifted n1en was to help their fellows to preseJ;ve and perpetuate the rights of tnan and 11plift n1an hin1self. The cank- ering greed for enonnous ·wealth had not yet be- gun to cast its eclipse. He beca1ne a teacher and inculcated· wi sdon1, which is learning and tnore. After all: a great teacher, if of the truth or of the true way to find it out, is· great among men, per- haps the greatest. Truth outlasts all else. \The teac'her n1ay perish and he forgotten, but his work retnains. Moth nor rust .corrupts it, nor thieves !nake it their spoil. Looking back over Dr. N ott's l•)ng career and surveying as best we tnay, the man, his work, and its fruits, we tnay caU hin1 great. 1le greatly projected his i~fluence for worthy enrls into his time, and after titnes, and rnay v.rf not say that he would seetn greater, if he had not him.se 1f enlarged our ideal '-'t greatness?

The first hop will take place Friday, October 29th, at Yates' Boat House. The committee has every prospect of giving a series of most successful dances. They intend having the best music and refreshments obtainable. It is hoped that the dances will receive the patronage of the entire student body. Here is a good chance for the freshmen to become acquainted with Schenectady society. Hops will be given during the winter ~nd spring terms, but as yet the number has not been decided upon. The committee however assures the student body that there will be as many as ever before, and if the regular attendance justifies it, there may be given extra Hops during the year. JUNIOR ELECTIONS. Daniel F. Imrie· of Lake George, has been elected president of rgo6, William E. Stoney, vice-president, and Nelson P. Weier, secretary and treasurer. Arnold G. Chapman was elected captain, and Raymond D. Sherman manager of the class football team.

WELL WORTH WHILE. arg-unlent. For two hou.rs in the :tnorning, within the walls of oid Nott Mernorhtl HaU whose his- tory is as varied and as g1torious as the life of its founder, they listened unceasingly to speeches, explainabie in merit and greatness by the n1ention alone o] the nan1es of the speakers. They heard stories galore by ;tnen who knew Dr. Nott as a friend and teacher, and saw mementos exhibited by a n1an who has had the honor to ddve the great presi- dent's horses. Again in the evening they heard vvith an interest that never flagged, glowing tributes by e1ninent educators to the character and work of Union's grand old man. The inspiration whicl1 the sight of bent, grey-haired old n1en who ,~rere here before the foxes left the campus, gave, ought to be enough to satisfy any appetite, however vora- cious for Union tradition and Union glory. An imperative duty compelled this celebra- tion to be given. It's over now and the debt is partly paid. Of course there is something that will be always owing. But the college is j t~st selfish enough to count as one result the good that it has de- rived from the event. The fact that Union was going to parade and puffeth up itself on Sept. 29th, has been published in every repre- sentative section of the c:oun try. That will count for sotnething. All the students frotn every departn1ent in Albany vvere here as Union men. They gave Union yells and sang U11ion songs and talked things over together. And that vvill count £or son1ething. If there existed any doubt in the tni nds of the alumni who were present at the celebra- tion and any ignorance in the skeptic grey n1atter of the undergraduate, concerning the It won't be necessary to have hot water in the gymnasiutn today as all the visiting players live in the city.

THE CONCORDIEN ... 'JIS. II NOTICE .. AU stude-nts who do n!ot wish to sub- scribe for the Concordiensis this college year will-kindly·.write ''*E.ej,,:cted'' on the copy that has been·sent them and leave it \Vithin the entrance of Middle Section, South College. The failure of any to do this will result in their names being placed on the regular subscription list. SPECIAL OFFER TO STUDENTS. Relying upon a prompt response and an increased support to insure them from financial loss, the Board of Editors will make a reduction in the regular price of the Concordiensis. To any student who will pay One Dollar and a Half before Nov. Jst, the Concordiensis will be sent for the entire college year. After that time the regular subscription rate of Two Dollars will be charged. It is not true that Messrs. Murphy of Tammany Hall and McCarren of Brooklyn are Union College graduates. A middle-aged alumnus was asking about the N ott prize scholarship ; why it was never mentioned in spite of the fact that it was once the chief honor of the college. Perhaps it has vanished in one of the \chinks that Time has n1ade.\ Once upon a time nobody registered in the fall unless it were mutually convenient to all concerned. Things are different now. WHAT THE PROFESSIONALS SAY. The Concordiensis has appeared and is one of the neatest publications bearing that natne in its history.-[Schenectady Gazette.] The first issue of the Concordiensis of this year appeared today and is a credit to the college. It is neat in appearance and is filled with good articles.-· [Daily U nion.J Of Mr. R. B. Cunningham, Union's new instructor in mathetnatics, The Evening World of Martinsburg, W. Va., says : \Prof. Cunningham was elected to the posi- tion of teacher in the first room at a special n1eeting of the board held on Saturday, Sep- tember 3, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Miss Ella Bowers. His work in the schools here has been satisfactory in every way, and although he has been here only a short time it \Vas long enough to sho\v that he was a very capable tea.cher. He is a native of Fairfield, Pa., and a graduate of the Shippensburg Normal school and Lafayette college of the class of 1902. He taught for t\vo years in a school near Philadelphia before coming here. The many friends made by the professor while in this city will be sorry to learn of his departure.\ Saratoga isn't the only place that has had political conventions this fall. The skating rink con11nittee met and ad- journed sine die. Slow decay and stoicisn1 get so tiresome son1etin1es that it is restful to begin the strenuous life over again. Mr. Pond could not be found by a Concor- diensis reporter, so we cannot state positively who :will be chairman of the soiree.

Presidents Woodrow Wilson of Princeton, Faunce of Brown) ][ opkins of WiHiatns, Steward- son of I-lohart and Finley of C. C. N. Y., addressed a fair sized audierH~e at the First Presbyterian church on Union. Sh-eet Thursday evening. 1tain alone p1.-evented the attendance from packing the a nditorium. The opening prayer was m.acle by Prof. J, P. Searle: president oi New Brtlnswick Theological Sen1inary. Every speaker pa ifl tribute to the influence over the students and the powerful individuality of Dr. :N ott. Prc::ident Raymond 1n introducing Presicl:ent 'Nilson stated that P1·inceton gave Union I1er ;first prPsiden t. Of Dr. N\ ott Presi Glent Wilson said: \To be able to concentrate n~oral force on the in eli\: iclt1al n1a11 was the chief virtue of Elipha:let N ott. He was a rnan of con ·rictions and a 1nan that stood by his con_yictions. It is this kind of a man who can justify every conviction that he pos- sesses that can sway the budding tnind of the stu dePt e1nd open the door for a new realization of ickals \ PresiJent Faunce of Brown, of whi:ch univers.ity Dr. N ott \v·as a graduate, spoke of the real assets of a college thus: \ii it is therefore seen that tnoney is not its asset ~nd we shnulcl be able to discover son1etl1ing whid1 mig-ht br call\~d the legaey of the college, I think thr!t we shall fin.c-1 this in the lasting dev9tion of an ~dmiring ahtn1ni. Self sacrifice gh·es cour- age anc1 self sacrifio:· for one's alma mater gives covrc-p-e to defenrl he1·.\ Dr. Raymond n1entioned the close relations of Union r!nd \Yilliarns and in traduced Pre siclent I-Iopkins who on his topic of ·~universal Ecluca- ti.on\ said: \Outside of the public school system, in w}Qich I 111 ay se1y Dr. N ott, the 111an whom we celebrate today, ·was .interested', and which was really one of the thi11gs nearest to his heart, there is growing the great university of cotlege educated people. This I welcome as one of the great ends toward the salvation of n1ankind and the salvation of the state.\ Presidents Stevrardson and Finley followed with address-es respectively on the ilnproved educational facilities and the importance of smaH colleges. Tl1e 'exerdses closed with \The Song to Old Union.'' WHO IS SOIREE CHAI:RMAN? Sophomores Divided as to How Office Should Be Given .. At present tnuch interest is being aroused in regard to the dispute going on among the mem- bers oi class of I907 concerning the chairmanship of the soiree connnittee. At a rneeting of the sopho1nore class on Tues- day, Septe1nher 20, by a unanin1ous vote Mr. E. ]. Fairbairn was eiected chairn1an of the soiree com- mittee. On the following day the president called anotJ1er n1eeting at which the action of the meeting of tbe day before was ratified. The meeting then aclj ourne d. Abont ten 1ninutes later the president posted a. notice on the bulletin board appointing Mr. ]. Sawyer chainnan of the com1nittee. The result is that there arc now two chairmen of the soiree comn1ittee. \Vill there be two soirees? To a Concordiensis reporter Mr. Fairbairn said: ''As far as I'm co11cerned I nnrst stand by what the' n1ajori ty of tb e class has decided.\ Mt·. vVhf:aclon,. president of the class, when in- t . 1 'd ern e\VeCl sa 1. : \It is not for the class to decide how the chair- mo.n should be selected.

At the present rr1oment the class is pretty even- ly eli vidtd and· neither side see1ns at all willing to yield a point to the other.

i I r6 THE CGNCORDJENSJS. FOOTBALL FOR THE WEEK. . · After the splendid showing of the footbaH team against :Columbia last Saturday, the outlook is a promis· i ng one t.or the rest of the season. Practice has con- tinued this week as usual, and a strong scrub team has adden materially in developing the 'varsity .eleven. Coach Smith says that the scrub is the best tfuat has t l!lrt:ted out for a number of years .and that the team is tl1ree weeks in advance of the season. Although m'ost - o!f the old team is back, competition is keen and no one ruan is absolutely sure of his place. The game today with the Edison. dub should prove a vktory to the wearers of the Garnet, and if the squad continues its faithful work, the remaining scores of the season should be in favor of Union. The line-up for Saturday's game is as follows: UNION. POSITION. Davl ·s ...................... Left end ............... Patton (Captain) .........................

THE CONCORDJENS/5. I7 TENNIS. Union May Meet Hamilton and Vermont. On Monday evening a meeting of those interested in Tennis, took place in Silliman Hall to re-organize the Tennis Association and to revive interest in the game. E. T. King, 'o5, was elected president, C .. S. Dwight, 'o6, secretary-treasurer, and Langley, 'o7, was ap- pointed chairman of the ,court committee. The association decided to hold a champi'Onship tournament this fall ia order to arouse interest and to find what material there is for a team in the spring. It is hoped that all tennis players in college and esp~cially freshmen, will register to enter the tournament, entries being closed Wednesday, September z8th. A fee of $5o is to be charged to cover the expenses of improving the courts, which at present are in pretty poor condition. For several years Hamilton and Vermont have been seeking matches with Union and it is expected that next spring a team· can be developed to compete with them and with other of Union's athletic rivals. A few of the matches will be played the latter part of this week and, according to their showing, men will be entered for the championship meet in the spring. COLLEGE MEETING. At the college meeting on Monday, after the election of Eliott, 'o7 as secretary to the student body, many matters of importance were brought up for discussion and some acted upon. First the ballot for assistant manager of the baseball team took place, resulting in the election of Mr. J. Leslie Moon. Manager Stevens then spoke for a few minutes as to the purposes of the Glee Club this year. In conclusion he asked for a tax of one dollar on the student body. A motion was passed ordering it; and then Mr. Reed announced the first meeting of the club for Tuesday evening. Captain Patton then discussed the Columbia game; and after telling of the different features of the game and the bright season which the game opened, asked that the student body put up a second set of bleachers for the students themselves to cheer from. Then followed the electing of Mr. Holdredge as secretary to the Athletic Board. After a few words from Mr. Hunt, .announcing the election of the assistant track manager for next Mon- day, the meeting adjourned. SENIOR ELECTlON:S. Frank I. Losee, ·President.

THE CoNcORDIENSIS VOL. LYXVI!I. .UNIOJ\T COL/.,EGE, OCT. S, I904. No.3 EARNINGS ·OF COLLiEGE MEN. Bowdoin Graduates as Examples. President Hyde of Bowdoin has issued a report, g 1 v1ng the earnings of Bowdoin alumni in the several professions. Of course these returns are not conclusive but they giv1.~ a fair idea of the pecuniary. value of a college education as weil as of the remuneration for the average professional college man. In his report President Hyde says: \I have asked such of the graduates of the col- lege as were willing to do so, to give me their annual earnings, their class and their vocation; 774 of those who are engaged in remunerative employment. which is about half the number of graduates in such e1nployment, have replied. The replies g(ve earnings, not incorne; which in most cases would be considerably more. Those whose earnings are largest, for obvious reasons, were most reluctant to reply. Although several are earning more than $r7 ,ooo, none who were earn- ing more than that atnotlnt replied. In the case of journalistn the number engaged i·1 that profes- sion is too small to n1ake the returns valuable; and the fact that there are two or three excep- tionally successful' editors in this stnall number gives to the results in that profession a more op- timistic aspect than wider induction would con- firm. \A table shows that, after the first 10 years. medicine leads, with an average remuneration of $ .J,e~K7. L1w con1es second, with $4.577· J onrnal- ism third (though, as explained, this is probably misleading), with $4,271. Business fourth with $J.700. Banking fifth, with $3.718. Governn1e11t employn1ent sixth, with $3,320. J\1iscellaneous pursuits seventh, with $2,867. Education eighth, with $2,258. The n1inistry ninth and last, with $1.559. The average earnings of the 493 persons reporting who have been out of college more than ro years ts $3.,356. lVIedicine is the profes- sion in whirh one n1ay acquire considerable earn- ing power most quickly, though the earning ca- pacity of the lawyer holds· out better in the later years. \1n law, mleclicine, journalism, business and n1isceHaneous pursuits the best period is from 30 to 40 years out of college; that is, between the ages of so and 6o. In the ministry, on the other hand, this period, with the exception of the first and last years, is least rem.nnerative of all. While in the earlier yea.rs the college graduate has, like other people, a hard struggle financially, earning on an average only $1,312 during the first ro years, yet after that ti1ne he earns much more than the average 1nan of good heredity and good opportunities who has not had a college educa- tion; and l1is earning power holds out well through life.\ OF INTEREST TO FUTURE JOURNALISTS Referring to the School of Journalism, founded by Joseph Pulitzec the President of Columbia University says: ''By agree1nent lVIr. Pulitzer reserves to hi1nself the right to name, when he sees fit, an Advisory Board, con1posed of the foremost journalists and editors, to which. board the proposed plan of or- ganization and course of study for the School of ]ournalisn1 are to be subn1itted. Until the mern- bers of this Advisory Board are nan1ed by the donor the definite organization of the School of Journalistn will not be proceeded with. The many and novel questions involved in the creation of this new school are receiving constant and care- ful consideration, both from the donor and fron1 the university, and it is hoped that the establish- ment of the school n1ay not be n1nch longer post- poned. \An unusual deg-ree of public interest has been

For the inforn1ation of the publiic and that of the numerous inquirers who look forward to enrolling then1selves as students in the School of J ournalisn1, when established, the university has printed for general distribution a pan1phlet containing the elaborate and convincing article on the propos,ed school which was contrib- uted by Mr. Pulitzer to the North Atnerican Re- view for May, 1904, together with his compli- tnentary paper on the \Power of Public Opinion,\ which vvas first printed in the Encyclopaedia An1ericana.\ THE RELATION BE .. TWEEN STU .. :DEN:T AND FACULTY. Dean, Ripton Speaks at Vesper Service. Dean Ripton spoke on Sunday afternoon, Oct. 2d. on ''The R,elation Between Students and Fac- ulty.\ He introduced the subject by saying that it was rather delicate and somewhat hard to handle on account of the difference of the point of view. If the n1atter of the point of view could be harmon- iously settled the whole subject would be. easily disposed of. The o hj ect of a college education is to gain knowledge and learn the truth. Therefore the aim of the stndent should be to learn the truth and his incentive. the desire to know. If all college mat- ters were looked at from this point of view then both student and faculty would have a con11non standpoint from which to act. The dean further subdivided his subject by speaking of where the authority should be placed. The professor gives the student all the credit that is his due and in the final issue of a disputed point, there can be no doubt as to where the au- thority lies. In speaking of athletics he said that the faculty recognized the need for sports but when t:nen be- can1e older they could not be enthusiastic for the sin1ple reason that .they could not enter into such sports. And, too, their observation led them to believe that in life the object could not he attained by the san1e methods as are used in athletics. Interesting as the subject is to all students, the speaker's characteristic handling of it 1nade it ap- pear 1n a doubly entertaining light. MEN WHO A:RE MISSED.

The rink will be 250 by 125 feet running length- ·wise behveen the foot of the Alpha Delta Phi ter- race and the road le~ding by the Psi U house. It will extend within ten feet of the road running north and south by the College office, and can. if 1 wcessarv. be widened to meet the terraces of Psi U ::~ nd Chi Psi. Consent has h een obtained from the city author- ities to get the water from the hydrant near the road. It is not definitely known what the expense of this will be but it is thought to be of minor importance. Appropriations by the students for the labor necessary to build it is the next logical action to be tal<en. UNION STUDENTS ENTERTAINED The State Stl·eet Methodist church opened its doors to the students of the college Wednesday evening and gave then1 a royal reception.

The first four weeks of college life can hardly serve as a fair baro1neter to ,inciicate the condi~tion of college affairs, say for two months hence. Indifference to activities strictly collegiate is so easily acquired during vacation that a sudden immersion in their midst tends to excite the pulse beyond the normail beat But Union begins the march this year \Vith s~ch a particular blaze and blare that, n1aking due allowance for ill winds and the dull atmosphere of winter, it should pull through the relapses and apathetic stages with scarcely a flicker. A larger class than usual has entered this fall. § udging- by all there is to judge fresh- nlen by, they will make one of the best classes that has ever entered here. This was the year for the N ott Mernorial celebration, and that came and left us material to ponder over in times of gloon1. The entire universit,? has been together on the catnpus thus earl~ Students of the law, medical and. college departments have been Union men together for one day this fall. This doesn't occur very often. At the first call for instrutnental and glee club IDen, many had to be turned away· Trips are now being arranged, and Union can expect one of the best rnusical clubs that ever gave a concert under its nan1e. An increase of tnenl bership, a large attend- ance and a greater interest at the n1eetings show a new a wakening for the Y. M. C. A. It's fun to watch the 'varsity practice now. Scrubs are out, and from the record and play- ing up to date there is lots and lots to hope for in the team. The idea lurks around that the team will cut a swath this fall. ''They play in the 11 good old fashioned way\ says one. Cheering for Union wasn't in1proved, it was discovered when bleachers were erected for the students across the ca·n1pus from the n1ound.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. II The engineering· department has been reor ... ganized . .and a fuH course in mechanical engineering added. Already graduates have entered for the advanced degrees. An inter-class track meet is on the boom for next week. The notion of a skating rink has gone so far that it is not Koing to be given up without a struggle. Tennis is moving this fall as never before .. The tou rna men t is now on and the results are being watched by many \Vho are not players. True, these things are not the summzon bonuut. But they are to blame fo.r alluring many to their devious ways of activity ana life. Will they and others sin1ilar continue so? THANKS. For the gift of a pile of boards, precious to us in their usefulness and in the spirit of the giver, which they represent, we have to thank an unknown friend. Should he desire more convincing evidence of our appreciation of his kindness, let hin1 journey to our campus any tin1e when a Union team is contesting for victory with visiting athletes. Fron1 any point he may survey, he will behold his lumber completely covered by a mass of collegiate hutnanity, howling perhaps, but conveying to him a gratitude which is in1possible to reproduce in print. With justification he n1ay feel, as he watches the crowd of cheering students, that were they to know that the giver of their bleachers was in eyesight or earshot of them, .their opportunity to thank hitn in the loudest and sincerest terms possible, would not be] ost. NOTICE. Freshme~ who desire to compete for places on the staff of tne Concordiensis, should hand their n.ames to the Editor .at once. There is a vacaBcy in the board of associate editors and one in the reportorial staff, each open for com,pe- tition to members of the junior and sophomore classes, respecti~ely. THE BOILING POT THE FRESHMAN. There arE: several things that the Freshman should be careful to note. In the first pla,ce he should take particu!lar pains to be present on the football :field every afternoon. This is expected of ,everybody. He should retnemher that it is his p[ace to speak to every fellow student he happens to meet on the campus or elsewhere and learn the footba11 yells and songs as soon as possible. Above all he should ren1e111her t:hat he is only a Freshrna11..-Hamilton Life. * * * * FRAILITY-. THY NAl\1E IS WOMAN. On the banks of Lake Lucerne, there strayed hand-in-hand a couple whose growing intimacy had becon1e of late the talk of the sun1n1er visitors who sojourned at the neighboring hotel.

There are several n1en in college \Vho, although they do belong to some political club, won't be able to help elect anybody on election day. The Tennis Tournament Owing to last week's bad weather and college affairs, the preliminary n1atches of the fuss tour- namrn t were postponed until this week. Several matches have now been played off and if the weather holds good it is expected that they will be finished by Saturday of next week. l\ti r.

He was educated in the pu:bHc schools of his native city, the Amsterdam Academy, and graduated from the classical course in Union college. After spending a year in the law ·offices of his brother, Mr. White, entered the Albany Law School, graduating with honors in 1897. Shortly after being admitted to the bar he went to Buffalo and became associated with the law firm of Moot, Brownell & Marcy. In 1898 Mr. White returned to Amsterdam to represent his brother, Captain White, who went to the Spanish-American war, in the firm of White & Ferguson. He again went to Buffalo, where he held an important position with the Buffalo Pitts Co., extensive manufacturers of traction engines, road rollers and farming machinery. He remained here until May, 1902, when he was ad- vised by his physician to at once give up work and return home. He returned to Amsterdam, May z6, and since that time he has been confined to his bed, suffer- ing from chronic interstitial nephritis. Last October he was removed to St. Mary's hospital.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. THE ;GLEE CLUB BACK TO LIFE. Student Intefest A wakened-'Several Trips Promised by Manager 'Stevens. If good material coupled with ·plenty of hard practice, lots of perseverance,. a tax of a d()Har per ,capita on the student body and the good wishes and h:elp ~of everyone in college can make a successful 'GJ!:ee Club, Union will have one. About fifteen mourners for the \corpse'' after a year's oblivion, met, organized and elected King, 'o5, president of the organization, and Reed, 'o6, leader of instrumental club and temporary leader of the Glee Club. As a proof that they were in earnest, a motion that every applicant for either club deposit three dollars with the manager, Stevens, 'o5,, and that a quarter be deducted for every ''bolt\ from rehearsal, was carried unanimously. The leader pro tem, spent most of Monday morning and afternoon in the college chapel, trying the voices of freshmen applicants and found several very good addi- tions to the old bunch. The first meeting of the Glee Club was held at Silli- man Hall, Monday evening, Septemberz6th, and a very satisfactory rehearsal was held. The tenor, usually the weak part, is exceptionaHy strong. The Instrumental Club held .its first meeting Tues- day afternoon, September 27th, at four-thirty. This was a short but interesting rehearsal in which an idea was given of the work ahead. Manager Stevens promises several trips, and those who have been on Glee Club trips know what effective inducements these are in making successful clubs. The clups are going to be run entirely by the students, no outside aid from professional musicians will be sought. The manager and the leader think that, by thus placing the responsibility of success or failure on the students themsehres, more strenuous in- terest will be taken. Last year, with excellent leader- ship, they failed, because they didn't accept any responsi- bility. This year it is enttrel y in the hands of the dubs themselves whether they fail or make a marked success. '' The prospect for a fine musical season is the best in years,\ says Manager Stevens. Meetings are held every Monday night, the Glee Club practice beginning at seven, ir,strumental practice at eight. As rehearsals go on, the chances are that the clubs will be the best in years. :It was by no means an easy task to pkk ou tsixteen men out of the twenty-six who presented themselves as aspirants for Glee Club mem- bership. The followin.g w~ere selected: FIRST TENOR SECOND TENOR Speir, 'o7 Cantwell, 'o7 Bishop, 'o7 Snow, 'o8 Sterns, '07 Richardson, 'o7 Davies, 'o8 Fuller, 'o6 FIRST BASS SECOND BASS Osborne, 'o7 M.cMu:llen, 'o8 Reed. 'o7 Richards, 'o7 Bell, 'o8 M. King, 'o5 Marx, 'o8 Klein, 'o8 The following were put on the reserved list: Reeder, '07 Halfley, 'o'8 Barth o lom,ew, 'o8 Tiffany, 'o8 Collins, 'o8 Keith, 'o8 Watson, 'o8 Mahar, 'o8 Later it seemed best to raise the number of the regular club to eighteen. and Mahar, 'o8 and Tiedeman, 'o7, were put with the first and second tenors respect- ively. The Instrumental Club is fortunate in posessing sever<.tl men of marked ability. The parts are well balanced and,,vith proper drill, will work together well. The following are the members: MANDOLINS Richards, 'o7 Huppuch, 'o8 Locke, 'o8 Fullerton, 'o8 Tomlinson. 'o8 Vrooman, 'o8 Tiffany, 'o8 GUITARS Schoolcraft, 'o8 Bishop, 'o7 VIOLINS Tiedeman, 'o7 Shelley, 'o8 Lanahan, 'o8 CELLO Davies, 'o8 Marx, 'o8 Bowman, 'o8 Wheeler, 'os Mahar, 'o8 CORNET Klein, 'o8 Stevens, 'o5 PIANO Reed, 'o6 (leader) At the third rehearsal, T9 out of zo were present Rehearsals never used to count for much.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 15 REPUBLICANS MEET. Collegians Gather Under Party Standard in SiUiman Hall. Fifty ·mem·bers of the G. 0·. P., about to cast their first ballot this fall, met in a mass .meeting at Silliman Hall and organized a Republkan club. Mr. Wadsworth, eJected temporary chairman of the gathering, introduced Mr. Miles Frisbie the speaker of the evening. Mr. Frisbie, as an Albany Law School graduate,. felt special interest in addressing the college boys at U nio.n. The main object of his short speech was to promote enthusiasm in a republican organizatio:n among the students, and great zeal was manifested by those present. After Mr. Frisbie's ·speech, Mr. Wadsworth was elected permanent chairman and Mr. BarnE's secretary or the club. Promises were made for numerous meet- ings. The first date being set for next Wednesday, when Col. James and other noted speakers will be present. On the tighteenth, Senator Depew and noted Republicans willl be the center of an enthusiastic rally in the city, and the Union Col:lege Republican club will be present en masse to help liven up the occasion. Among those who registered as members on Wed- nesday evening were: Raymond, De Sabia, Reeder, Clossen, Mead, Rider, Sleicher, Vedder, Fuller, Arms, Bryant, Richardson, Butcher, Taylor, Holmes, Hitt, Ray, King, Brooks, Gilmour, Fairbairn, Macintosh, Hart, Parsons, Snow, Wiley, Wright, Weier, Farrington, Lewis, Smith, Weyranch, Bowman, Sphtr, Franchot.

By the generosity of a loyal friend of the Col- lege, Uilion has a new set of bleachers. Who this friend is. would not be given for publication. by those who know. Altbo,ugh unable to personaHy thank the giver, it is a ·rock bottotn truth that the students will show their appreciation of the bleachers' useful- ness in ways which cou111t for tnore sincerity than tnere words. The bleachers are on the west side of the camp- us, directly opposite the old ones on the tnound. There are :five tiers, each tier being about sixty feet long. It is estin1ated that the seating capac- ity will be about 400. This extra room al'lows for a few guests whom the students may wish to bring to the gan1es. The old bleachers on the n1ound will as usual be open for friends and any visitors at the gan1es. This wiH result in the students being separated from those whose interest in the ga1ne it at times rudely shattered by the screeching and enthusias- tic outbursts of Union tnen. It is expected that the cheering will now be developed to the beauty point. Bunched in together in one cornpact tnass of Union n1en, the students can not cheer the tean1 to a pitch unknown by any past eleven. One other change will follow the advent of the bleachers. The ho1ne tean1 will probably now have its bench on the west side of the campus. Hitherto the visiting team sat, when it wasn't playing-' directly in front of where the new bleach- ers now are. Naturally a change is necessary. In today' s game for the first ti1ne the students will cheer from a point from which everyone of then1 can watch proceedings while 1naking the welkin ring with Union hussahs. ~-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------~ Calf Oxfords at Fearey's $3.50 ana $5 }os.

The enouragen1ent giY- en the supporters of the Garnet by the Colutnbia game was fully ju1stified in the result of Saturday's game. It woud be difficult to pick out any of the play- ers as more deserving of praise than others. The honors for 'ground gaining belong to Moore. Harvey, Dann, and Patton. On the defense everybody ,~,-as in every play. First Half. Patton kick:ed off for Union. After several short gains by the Electricians, the Garnet line held and a fake punt was tried. The play was smashed for a loss and the ball was union's, near the center Gf the field. Short dashes through tackle and a·round the end by the backs, and Patton and Dann, brought the bail to the Ed,i- sons' three yard line, where it was lost on downs. The Edison team punted well down the field, :McNab getting the ball but making no gain. Chiefly by 1neans of a pretty end run by Patton, the ball was again brought within a few yards of the Edison goal but was lost by a fumble. Again getting the ball on the punt, for the third time McNab ·started his machine for the line, this time successfully. My 1neans of short dashes, the ball was brought to within fifteen yards of the goal, where it was given to Moore. Tackled when near the line, he was dragged over for the first touchdown by Kluge and Von Dan- ncnhurg. Patton kicked the goal easily. Union, getting the ball on the kick-off, was rapidly forcing it down the field when time was called. Second Half. In this half the Edison Club let out a new wrin- lde, which they had discovered by accident in the first half. Sending the ball less than ten yatds on . the kick-off, one of their own men was enabled to g-ain possession of it. Then began their only ground-gaining of the day. By repeated line-bucks, resulting in two or thr.ee yards at a time, they slowly forced the ball nearly to Union's line, where the Garnet braced ; nd held for downs. From this point, by short gains through the line and arou111d the ends, the ball was carried to the Edison Club's three yard .line. Twiee the illatter's line held for no gain, but on the thhd try Rayrnond was shoved over the line. Patton kicked his second goal, n1aking the score 12-:0. 'l)n the nex:t kick-off it was the sarne old story. At no point could the Edison Title s'top the ad- vance and the gan1e ended with the ball but a few yards from another touchdown.

THE CoNCORDIEN:siS VOL. XXVIII. UNIOAT COLLEGE, OCT. I5, 1904. 1\lo. 4- PRESIDENT HARPER O,F CHICAGO UNIV:ERS:JTY ON THE 20TH CENTURY COLLEGE. Salaries of Professors- Chances of · Poor Students to Earn an Education. \The zoth century college will be much better equip- ped than the college of the past. It will have a better library, better facilities for physical culture, and above all better facilities for the study of science. We have now many thousand high schools which are better equipped ir~ such particulars than were the majority of our colleges zo years ago. This will compel the college of the futur~e to make itself stronger along these tines or it must become an acade;tny. \In discussing the future of the American college, however, one must sharply distinguish between the college and the university. We have now to deal with univer5ities, something which did not exist in America 30 years ago. The bearing of our several large and rapidly growing universities upon the college question is very close. ''The college professor is seldom adequately paid, and the same is true of the teachers in the public schools. When we take into account the ability required, the cost of preparation, the constant intellectual strain under which a professor or teacher works, the import- ance of having means for the purchase of books and travel, and the necessity of providing for old age, it is beyond question true that the salaries paid in America are sadly inadequate. \On the other hand it is to be remembered that these salaries are perhaps larger than in any other country, even 'Germany not excepted, and also that the professor and the public school teacher have ,many compensations. It is probably true that no other profession of today offers larger or more flattering inducements to young men or young women of real ability. For the man or woman who ha~ the instinct of presenting to others tl1at which he himself has gained in the way of knowl- edge, there is no more enjoyable work. I am sure there is no calling in which tlae satisfaction of render· ing service can be greater. ''The cost of education has ;unquestionably i.ncreased, but it is not true that a poor boycan not earn his college course as formerly. With the increase in cost there has also come the establish:lil1ent Gf scholarships, of loan funds, of agenc.ies for assist~i ng the students to ob- tain work, and the number of people whose hearts prompt them· to render such assistance is greater every year. The cost of a college education varies with lhe location of the college, the atmosphere around it, and especially with the circumstances of its foundation. There are colleges in which a boy may receive a fair training for $zoo· per annum, and there are others in which he cannot spend a year for less than $Goo or $8oo. In both cases he can generally find opportunities to earn a large part, ;jf not all, of his expenses. Our state universities of the west chdrge either no tuition fees or very low ones.'' THE NESTOR OF THE FACULTY Interesting Reminiscences of \:Uncle Billy\ Wells. Perhaps the n1ost interesting character of the Facnlty of Dr. N ott and the otuly surviving mem- ber of it. is Dr. William Wells whose career cov- ers the n1ost strenuous period in the history of our college and the United States. Born 87 years ago in the Philade-lphia which bore all the ear-marks of Benjatnin Franklin's vast wisdo1n, he stttdied, and graduated from the fam- ous old Franklin Institute. From his seat in the class roo1n he overtooked the grave ·of the famous philosopher. \Vhen but I 5 years of age he began the study of foreign languages, giving instructions in English in return for Gern1an and French. Gradually beco1ning known he was sutntnoned to Genesee Wesleyan Se1ninary where he served as President for so1ne years. As tin1e wel'lt on the location of Genesee College, as it was then. called, seetned to

Pres~dent' W,ells, seetng the fact and realizing the necessity of change, 'vas instrumental in caHing the colilvention which finaBy decided to remove the college. It was \Uncle Billy\ who conceived the idea of locat- ing at Syracuse and of changing the na.n1e to that of Syracuse Univ,ersity, which :institution owes to Prof. Wells' foresight and wisdom its greatness. \Uncle Billy\ acted as President of Syracus,e for a number of years and had the pecuHar distinction of being the only member of its faculty who was not a clergyman. When asked by a Concordiens.is reporter as to how he happened to become connected with Union College, he replied: \At the tin1e of my connection with Syracuse I was also helping Dr. Schaaf with his famous Gennan Cotnn1entary, and as it was necessary to see him often to consult concerning it, I found that the great distance frotn Syracuse to New York-there were no railroads and the JOUrney took a week-was a great hindrance to the final cotnpletion of the work. At this time I was ap- proached by ~he Truste~s _of Union College and requested to accept the chair of Modern Lan- guages. It is well known that Union was one of the first colleges to introduce the study of tnodern languages. I came here in order to be 111 more direct cotntnunication with Dr. Schaaf. \My experience as a teacher covers 70 years. \I was connected with the An1erican Legation at Berlin during the first few years of my connection with Union and while there, studied in the Uni\·er- sity o,f Bonn.\ Here \Uncle Billy\ showed a scar on the top of his head which he received as follows: \It was during the tin1e of great unrest and agi- tation in Gertnany and bands of students quarrel- ing with soldiers and townspeople were con1mon sights. During one of these quarrels I beca1ne interested and joined a band of students in the , 1 Konigsplatz. We were ordered to disperse by the soldiers, but being hem1ned in on all sides foui1d it impossible to do so and remained standing where we were.

On Friday, the 7th, Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie gave .a Hl.ost interesting lecture on th.e \Education of Shakespeare,\ before the students. After .a brief introduction by President Rayntond . expressing the pleasure of the students on again hearing Mr. lVIabie. the lecturer began his address. T:b.e skepticistn in regard to Shakespeare is founded on the inaccurate knowledge of his life. It is a genera) rule that no one stumbles on greatness :-it is the result of good preparation and hard work. The difficulty in regard to Shakespeare has been the narrowness of the defi- niti.on of education. The widelr' definition of edu- cation explains the problem of his character. There first is q1 ing; and the age. There ~ the great .pre sst on ingly the edg-e of the write puts his peare. on he saw t There is than the get by a appreciat~ there is r church \\ flowing meadow incdent s atHl n1akE schoolhot The long master's ence, Ovi eca; hen \Book of all. the I Arnold, \ Then he1 knowledg writers; 1- Shakesr marvelow came in c time was of player~ mn.

THE CONCORDJENS.lS. 7 There are three elements of education. The by-words,. and their swear-words. From his ap~ first is quality of ll)ind; the second, specific train- ing; and the third, the condition .and education of the age. There are two reasons why it is difficult to grasp the great power of Shakespeare's mind. His ex- , pression is altnost wholly dramatic, and accord- ingly the ayerage \reader does not gain a know1~ edg-e of him personally. Today one recognizes the writer's own feelings in his characters. He puts his own thoughts into his people. Shakes- peare. on the contrary, made meH and women .as he saw them and not as he w,ish.ed them to be. There is nothing which brings one closer to hin1 than the back glimpse of his lirf e which we n1ay get by a vi sit to Warwickshire. To teach one to appreciate Shakespeare himself. and his works there is nothing Eke a 1noor1light night. The old church \\Tith the graveyard aronnd it, the Avon flowing sn1oothly just beyond and the broad meadow where old Stratford stood, call back the incdents of his life to one who bas studied them atHl n1ake him appreciate them. There is the old schoolhouse where he went to school as a boy. The long straight-backed benches and the high master's chair. Here he read Plaut us, and Ter- ence. Ovid. and Virgil. Horace. Cicero, and Sen- eca; here he studied Lille's Grammar and the \Book of Sentences.\ And here he studied abo\Te all. the Bihle. \Great literature:·· says Matthew Arnold, \is the best source for a great education.\ Then here were Shakespeare's sources of the knowledge of life and culture-in these old classic writers; here he acquired his cotntnand of style. Shakespeare's receptivity and assimilation was marvelous. During his early life Shakespeare came in contact with many traveling players. His time was a tin1e of itinerant actot-s, when a troupe of players would perfonn in the courtyard of an 11111. He became well acquainted -with then1, learn- ing all their ways and custotns. Besides this in his journeys around the country he used his eyes and ears. He visited every tavern within reach; tnade the acquaintance of its inmates, of the hostler of the inn, of the idlers of the to'Wi1, of the typical characters. He had all these characters at first hand; he knew their stories, their hobbies, their prenticeship in London he gained his intimate knowledge of stage scenery. Then, too. how different was the theatre of Shakespeare's time from what it is now. The theatre of his titne was the library of the people, their tneetingplace, there they learned the history of their ancestors, both rem.ote and near; there they learned the literature, the songs. the n1usic of their country. Nothing ii1 our day can equal the power and influence of the theatre of his titne. Shakespeare had no literary consciousness. He never thought of himself as one of the literary people of his tin1e. Why, then, should he care to keep or publish his plays? So it happens that the plays published during his own life are full of blun- ders. And no wonder, for they were not in con1- plete form-the parts being distributed an1ong the players-and it was necessary to take them down by shorthand. And to n1ake it worse, in the print- ing of them one man sat in the i11iddle of the floor and read the n1anuscript to the typesetter. It seetns strange to us that one who had pro- duced such great and almost in1possible works should not want to perpetuate the111. But we tnust remen1ber that in Shakespeare's time there was no reading public. There was only a public who at- tended the theatre to enjoy its influence. \In our day the uneducated man reads the \New York I ournal'': in that time he heard Barbara Allen in \Chevy Chase.'' What a difference! afl.an1e with discovery. It was a titne of warm glowing feeling when everyone was carried away by the glow of life. England was a nest of sing- ing birds; full of men whose poetns are forgotten because everyone wrote poetry unconsciously, even as it is in Roumania now where even the air is vocal with tnusic. This was the titne in which Shakespeare was brought up. The lyrical age fol- lowed in which he wrote. That. too, has passed away, and now we have the commercial age. In Shakespeare's tin1e, too, everyone had sotne knowledge of the law and of medicine. There were n1any writers in his ti1ne who may have had a better acquaintance of those professions than he did; but he had the intelligent and educated 111an's grasp of thetn. Likewise everyone knew

8 THE CONCORD!ENSIS. something of music. Everyone sang~ and knew corr,ectly every song and opera of the tin1e. The great bard came at the end of this period of rediscovery of the Renaissance of man attd of nature. He was one of the greatest exponents of the individual idea. It was on accou111t of this real- ization of personality that he was the master of what we call character. His plays are dramatic because the tnan is hound to his past and his past works out his life for him. Every man lives in his ovvn world and atn1osphere. The only unity of Shakespeare is the unity of hutnan life resulting in a complete character. It is because he recognized this unity that he mingles so admirably comedy and tragedy. No n1an could deal as he did with the tnaster passions of men. Vvr e find all his plays a realization of life. We cannot understand him; but it is because his great superiority in knowledge of hutnan nature. His feeling for language, his deep imagination, his dramatic instincts, can no tnore be understood by the most educated and eloquent men of today than the owls can under- stand the light-hearted song of the lark as it rises to the blue sky in the morning air. After the lecture an informal reception was held in the college chapel. Members of the faculty and their wives besides a nun1ber of people from the city ~ere present. NON--CANDIDACY FOR DAGGETT PRIZE MEANS F AlLURE. So Says Rev. Mr. Lunn at Vesper Services. At vesper service, Sunday afternoon, the Rev. Geo. R. Lunn of the First Reformed church, spoke on \The College Man's Opportunities.'' Mr. Lunn, besides having had his seminary course is a graduate of two colleges, and his inspiring, yet practical talk, showed him to be keenly in sympathy with the college man. Mr. Lunn said that the opportunities of the college man are large and many and among the largest is the opportunity to develop the highest type of manhood. We are in education, that is for the discipling of our powers so that we may learn to think accurately and .completely. College life is not a sigment to be cut out of our whole life. It should be lived now as we mean to Hve life in the future, a~ter graduation. Work amd problems conquered no·w will so much tll.e more increase ou.r effidency when it cones to work in the world. Another opportunity ;eollege presents is the oppor- tunity for frieadships-the friendships of the protessors and the friendships of the f.eHows with whom we work G Mr. Lunn quoted in sayhrg that the influ.ence of the student body of a college probably did mo:re to sta111p the individuality of its graduates than the influence 0i the college faculty. The kiendships of coHege are tf:le lasting friennships of !lilie-those which mould tl~e character. A third opportunity is the opportunity for de:velopimg the moral man. When at first the thoughtful student begins the study of the sdences, the tendency is toward infidelity, but if he perseveres in the perusal of truth, bel.ief is sure to return. As Pope says, '·'A little learn- ing is a dangerous thing.'' In entering college we should remain true to our :highest life. College usuaHy makes or mars the man and if it is in him the most enduring manhood will be developed. Mr. Lunn spoke of Union's Daggett Prize for con- duct and character and said that if at the end of a four years course in this college a student was not one ()f those at least considered f.or the prize, he should have to look upon one important phaze of his college life as a failure. In closing Mr. Lunn said it should always be remem- bered that character has its genius in thought. N () crime was ever committed that was not com.m:itted again and again in the perpetrators' mind. It is in· possible to hide ourselves, so if we are full of rigl\It thinking, right living will come of itself. Y. M. C. A. fhe Tuesday evenin!; prayer meeting of theY. JV\. C.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. II WHO'S TO BiLAM E '1 Union students pride t~1emselves on the courtesy which they exercise toward vtstttng· tean1s. Not by a word, a gesture, a sound, would they hurt the feelings of athletic rivals, whether defeated or vi:etorious. So anxious are Union students to show deference and good wHl to opponents on the campus that, with a rigid self-control, they sn1other the least rising ,of: a rnurn1ur of satis- faction at an opponent's rnisbap. If a visiting team is penalized in the course of a game, the Union bleachers are silent with sympathy. Should a visi,ting player be hurt and then recover, Union~ students applaud. If a good play is made by the visitors, Union students praise it. In the light of victory or defeat, the other teatns are given a Union cheer always, as a valedictory. 'Tis well! But there is a little tale which we have to relate. Last Saturday night the Rochester players withdrew frorn the field, vi,ctorious, but bruised and tnuddy, to the gyn1nasium-the first gymnasium ever erected by a college. I-Iad there been anyone there who had ever been in the'building twice before, the visitors tnigbt have found their way about with comparative ease. As it was, the groping a bout the wall and the feeling in the da<t:k, necessary to find a door and eventually a g-as jet, may be left to the imagination. Particulars are not necessary now. We close the disagreeable chapter by saying that there was a superabundance of hot water but with the light of the roorn. in inverse ratio to the noon day sun. Not an Union student, not an Union repre- sentative of any kind \vas there to alleviate the difficulties of the place. The efforts of the Rochester men to procure a lamp in the sections of south. college were unavailing. At last a candle was unearthed by somebody, and iHunli nated by its flicker- ing flame, our visitors tool{ a rub-down and departed. THE LECTU:RtE: C:OURSE. One man of letters, known far and wide for his literary culture and his writings on literary subjects; through the efforts of President Rayn1ond, has begun a series of lectures be- fore the students of U n~ion. Other n1cn of ·many professions and of diverse branches of life work will cotne here to speak the lessons of experience and of success to those who, it is comtnonly thought, will be most benefited by then1 and tnost apprecia:t ive of then1. The only conditiotl that detern1ines the nurn ber of speakers in the future is the attend- ance and the interest of the students who go to hear then1. I.t see£ns strange that a student, whether engineer, scientific or classical, should be averse to hearing an authority tell in ninety minutes vvhat that student n1ay be years 111 learning and ·what will ahvays be of value to him as a knowledge easily gained. We have received a cotnm unication from two foreign writers that they, while excavat- ing in Ron1an ruins, accidentally came upon a wonderful find, in the shape of ancient manuscripts. Extracts from these, literally translated, will appear in early issues of the Concord i e 11 sis. Uniop has 37 n1embers of the University Club. The total membership is 3406; sixty- five per cent. of which is contributed by the four leading institutions; Yale, Harvard, Col- urn bia and Princeton. The Harniltot) trip today bids fair to be a crossing of the Alps. It won't be entirely a retreat from Mosco\v, any how.

LEHIGH'S ;HONOR SYSTEM. Last .May the students of Lehigh University adopted an honor system. a statement of which appears as fol- lows in \The Brown and White\ : We, the students of Lehigh University, do hereby pledge ourselves on our honor, to abstain from all fraud in University written recitati-ons, quizzes and exam in aD tions, and to take proper measures to prevent any in- fringement of this resolution, according to the following rules: 1. All students of Lehigh University shall constitute a committee for the faithful fulfillment of the above resolution. 2. The society known as the Arcadia shall be the virtual head and governing body ef the aforementioned committee. 3· It shall be the duty of every student to report to- the Arcadia in person, any infringement of th~ above resolution. If, however, a man is seen cheating by any member of the aforementioned committee, the man see- ing the offense may have the privilege of telling the offender to leave college. In case he refuses to do this he shall be reported. 4· Upon the receipt of such a report, the Secretary of the Arcadia, in the pre£ence of the Society, shall draw from a box containing the names of the members of the two upper classes, the names of fifteen men. Twelve of these men shall be selected by the accused to form a jury for trial. The jury thus selected shall be called to order by the aforesaid Secretary for organization, after which it shall proceed to the trial. 5· If the accused is convicted, he shall be notified to leave college within two days. Failing to comply in this, his name shall be handed to the Faculty for their action.

THE COJ.VCORD!E.li/SIS. MUSICAL CLUBS. The Gl:ee ,C:lub practice have been excellent. The voices are blending well and at this rate, will agreeably surprise fuutre audiences,. The dubs are bound to be an honor to the ,col:l~ge. New music is being purchased .and already the dub is in shape to take up one or two Df the realy fine male choruses. The violins and cello wiiH accopany the club in these. The Instrtimental 'Club is manifesting unusual ability in memorhing and harmonizing popular choruses, without use of written music. This is not easy in a very small number, and much more difficult with eight violins, eight mandotins, four guitars, etc. The prac- tices are bringing out the ability to appreciate express- ion, and to produce tine effects in shading. The Quartette has been picked from the Glee Club, to consist temporarily at least, of Bishop, 'o7, first tenor; Reed, 'o6, second tenor, Bell, 'o8, first bass, and Kline, 'o8, second bass. The first quartette practice showed that these men, with practice enough can succeed in this most difficult branch of vocal work. A string quartette will be picked Monday evening. LAW SCHOOL NOTES.

If there is but one student or reader who opens this paper this week with the expectation of reading a story on the tennis tournament or anything connected with tennis at l~nion during the week, for the sake of the interest of that one we make an explanation. ilt was like this. We were unfortunate in depending on one p erson to give us the tennis news this week. To a reporter; who called on· him for the facts, he stated that he was too busy to say anything. So it's nothing is that nothing does. COLL,EGE MEET IN G. College meeting wa:s called to order Monday morning by Rresident Losee. Doctor Towne, Captain Patton, and Manager Odell in turn urged the students to go to Clinton to see the Hamilton game . The ann<!mncem,ent of the interclass track meet was repeated.

UNION COLLEGE, Schenectady, N. Y. Editor of the Concordiensis: Dear Sir: In your Concordiensis of last week, through an error on the part of the editor, or the printer or the secretary of the Republican club, my name ap- peared among the members of the College Republican club. Out of loyalty and devotion to my national party, that party of true American principals, I feel called upon to rectify the mistake by saying that I very emphatically replied \No\ when asked to ally myself with the Republican party. Yours very truly, GEO. W. HITT. October roth, 1904. For Those Geological Investigators. Antediluvian Monster (to Mammoth). \You try to bite me and I'll brak yoh 'pod.\ This cry 'noyed hirn s·ome.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. FOOT BALL FOR T,HE WEEK. It certainly was hard luck to lose that Rochester gan1'e after th'e way the boys played an around the other fellows. It was a game for all t.o be proud of. even if \Ve did lose. I ' And yet, even to an. outsider, it did not seen1 all 1nilk and honey. A little better generalship at sotne points ~Ttight have changed the score, there was a little failing in that direction. Patton's punting was, on the whole, good, but the blocking of t!hat last kick was what lost the game. But that's all over and done and it's get together for today's game with Hamilton. This last week has been discouraging. The con- tinuous rain made playing impossible on Tuesday and \N ednesday. Monday's work was stiff, but the play was not as good as on Thursday. On that clay eyerybody got into the game with a snap and dash that promises well. The varsity went through the scrub at will and held them well. On l\~1onday, however,. the scrub at times ahnost played the big fellows to a standstill. The line-up will be about the s;une as before. Norwood, a new Junior, who has lately come out, looks good and n1ay develop into a first rate line 1nan. Colburn has got his shoulder harness and is now out regularly. lVIonday he was gi\·en scrub quarter and showed up well. He is a fast rnan. dear headed and handles the ball cleanly. He should 1nake the other quarters hustle yet. The gatne today should be close. Cornell beat Hamilton 34-0, but the score by no n1eans tells the story. lVIore than once Cornell was thoroughly scared. The New York Herald said of the game: \I-Ian1ilton held Cornell to twelve points 1n the first half, but was unable to keep the ball. In the beginning of the second half the visitors tore up Corne:ll's defence and five times gained first down by steady line bucking.\ Han1iiton is strong on the offensive, especially in line work, and that see1ns at present to be our 1nos1 vulnerable point. As regards the physical condition of the n1en, nothing more could be de·· sired. \Bill\ Smith says that they were never better. The line-up will probably be: U . 111011. D:avis (Cook) left end.

DEFEAT IN MOMENT OF VICTORY A Blocked Punt, Two Minutes of Play Aided by Darkness Gives Rochester the Game. 1J nion, although outweighed 10 lbs. to a man. played circles around the eleven from Rochester on the campus last Saturday. In the amount of ground gained during the game·, Union was ahead once over, and the chances are that she would have come forth victorious had it not been for the darkness which closed in upon the last few min- utes of the gan1e. All the players are deserving oi praise but the ground gaining of Harvey, :J\1oore and Patton and the tackles of Davis deserve spec- ial mention. FIRST HALF. \ Patton kicked off for Union. After several short runs by the visitors, Rochester lost the ball on a fumble. Short runs were made through cen- tre and guard, and then Robinson tryed a quarter- back trick, but was unable to .gain any ground. Union was forced to kick and Rochester after a few gains was forced to kick also. At this stage Becker was substituted for Raymond. Rochester then tried. an end run. After advanc- ing the ball a few yards more Rochester lost the baH on downs to Union.

16 THE CONCOR.IJ1ENSIS. '· the pigeonhole of dullness, they scatter blood- curdling phrases recklessly about without a care as to the effect on the readers. The effect on son1e must be terrible! Following ts a quotation on the Rochester game: \The way the boys in garnet togs swept down the field was intoxicating to the crowd. \Plunge plunge, plunge; yard after yard they pegged away toward the visitors' goal. It was desperate work for Rochester was stubborn to its fullest strength. •'The hundred yards at the start went down to seventy then a bad pass lost it all and more too. Ninety yards, eighty yards, seventy, sixty, fifty, less and less grew the distance as a ton of desper- ate Unioners pounded away at a ton of boys frotn the Flour City. \It was forty yards, thirty, twenty-ten! and the - crowd grew as frantic as the players. \Eight yards, five yards. two yards, one yard! and crash went the Union back into the seething mass! \It was like striking a horse or an elephant; it yielded inches! \First down and two feet away fron1 a touch- down. \Second down and but a foot of ground needed. \Now for the effort of eleven lives. \Grim determination looked through the sweat and blood in twenty-two faces. \There was a head on collision of two lines of giants; a seething mass, a strange tnixture of legs. anns and heads, a wobbling as of a top spun down and the officials began picking off the n1en.''' * * * * H·ere are a few more: '\With the ball in their hands they played with fiendish determination. It was football at its best and worst! It was a great fight to see, but it was kilil ing to those who were in· it. Almost every rus l~t brought men to the ground half conscious and frequently som,e one was too far gone to resurn·e his work.\ * * * * ''The time wore on.'' * * * * '''Not a man tn a garnet sweater but who would sto()d before a locomotive to have stopped the on- slaught. But pluck was against pluck and thrilled wid11 one last hope the visitors crashed straight into the line.\ * * * • ,., It counted as a goal, hut only by· the thickness of a hair.\ * * * * 1.1any on the side lines failed to see the good judgment that ordered two attempts to carry the ban instead of a punt on the first down, when the ban was on Union's ro yard line with but four tninutes to play and darkness coming on all the ti1111 e. * * * * One thing about the bleachers-they're comfort- able-· and offer a good view of the field.

I \ THE CoNc,oRDIENSI.s VOL . .t:YXVIII. UNJOAT CO'LLEGE, OCT. 22, I904. No.5 ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT RE- ORGANIZED AND IMPROVED. Professor Steinmetz and R. Neil Williams Dsserve Most Credit ·for Change. F acuity Changes. Since last year there have been tnany changes in Union's Faculty. Shortly before the opening of the tern1 Dr. Curtis resigned and Dr. Edward Ellery was secured to take his place in the chemis- try departn1ent. Dr. Ellery comes thoroughly pre- pared. After. graduating at Colgate he studied in Berlin and in Heidelberg where he received the degree of Ph.D. Professor G. W. Wright is on leave of absence for a year and his work is being done by Professor Fprlykee and Professor F. S. Willian1s, together with 1\!Ir. Gervis of the Departtnent of Mathe- matics. In order to relieve Mr. Garvis, Mr. R. B. Cunninghan1, LaFayette '02, comes as an instruct- . or in mathen1atics. Because of the illness of Pro- fessor Edwards it will be necessary that his place in the department of Engineering be filled and for this position A. B. Young, a graduate of the U ni- versity of Vern1ont, has been secured. The most important changes of the year have taken place in the Department of Electrical En- gineering. Professor Steinmetz and Professor R. Neil Williams being the only members of this de- partment of last year's faculty. . Professor Steinn1etz and Professor R. Neil •Wil- liams with the advice of some of the foremost American engineers have reorganized the whole Electrical Engineering Department basing it on papers read before the Association of Atnerican Engineers held in Great -Barrington, in 1902, and wi 1 hout doubt it now gives the broadest and tnost th< !rough course in the country. i ·:>r this departn1ent the college has been fortu- nat ~· enough to secure Dr. E .. F. Creighton who has :had training both in this country and abroad. Dr. Creighton is a man of much practical as well as ted'l:nical experience, having been e1nployed by the Stanley Electric Co., of Pittsfield, and the General Electric Co., of this city-the latter com-· pany still retaining him as a consulting engineer. He wiH have charge of all graduate work giving, at t.he same time, much of his attention to under- graduate students. The great importance of a knowledge of me- chanica 1 engineering in connection with electrical engineering work has been recognized by the or- ganizers of the course and Professor H. W. Mans- field is to take charge of this phase of the instruc- tion. He will instruct in hydraulics, turbine de- sign, steam engine theory and design, therme- dynarnatics, gas engines and steam turbines. All undergraduate work in. electrical engineering will be under the in1mediatee direction of Profes- sor R. Neil Williams. Professor Steinmetz is the responsible head of this cours.e, giving tnuch of his titne to it and it is because of his interest in it that the course has had such a reputation from the beginning. Prof. FRANK SARGENT HOFFMAN The philosophical writings of Frank Sargent Hoff- man of the chair of philosophy at l.!nion University, have attracted considerable attention during the past four years. His \Sphere of the State\ has recently gone into the fourth edition, and a late publication, \Psychology and the Com.mon Life,'' is meeting with unusual success. Dr. Hoffman was born in Sheboygan Falls, Wis., February 9, 185z, but nearly all his early life was spent on a rocky farm in New Hampshire. When he was about seventeen years of age his parents moved to Galesburg, Ill. His own intention then was to secure a position as brakeman on a railroad that ran through the place and as soon as possible to become a conductor. He had a distant relative who had long been _in the em-

6 THE ·CONCORDIENSIS. ==============================================================~· - ploy of the road and he expected to get an appo,intment through his influence. To hL.., utter surprise this rela- tive refused to help him in the matter,. but allowed him to stay at his house and attend the academy near by till he cou:td obtain some other employment. The result was that he soon was afire with the idea of going to college. With some assistance from home and some outside manual labor he continued his studies for two consecut!ive terms in the academy and then secured a position as a district school teacher. He ''boarded round'' :in the homes of the scholars and found that about h.alf of his time had to be devoted to the enter- tainment- of the parents of the children after school hours. Som·etimes he was at his wit's end to find out just how to fulfill this mission. After three months in the country he was asked to take the principalship of a grammar school in the city .of Galesburg, where he remained a year and then entered Knox College to go on with his studies. There he had Eugene Fields for a chum and classmate. After two years of college work. he took a position in the Galesburg High School for one ye?r and then entered Amherst College where he graduated in 1876. The year after leaving college he was instructor in Latin and Greek in the High School at Princeton, Ill. From Princeton he went to Yale to perfect himself in the Greek language and literature, but finally took the course in theology, graduating with the D. B. degree in r88C>. Shortly before Commencement he was as- signed to the Hooker fellowship which had just been established in the institution, the income of which en- abled him to study theology and philosophy for two years longer at Yale and abroad. M.ost of the time was spent at Berlin and Heidelburg with Zeller and Kuno Fischer. On returning to this country he accepted the position .of instructor in philosophy at Wesleyan University, which he held until he was -appointed professor of philosophy at Union College in 1885.-· AmeriGln Education. ALUMNI. '15.-\How soon a man is forgotten is forcibly illus- tarted by a letter of inquiry received here (Battle Creek, Mich.,) by Battle Creek's oldest lawyer, Charles E. Thomas, stating that a history of the alumni of Union College in Michigan was being written, and that among the alumni was Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, once a poli- tidan of national 'reputation. The history of the m:an was known to .a certain pO·int and there he dropped out o.f sight. It was thought that the governor had died in Battle Creek. Mr. Thomas called to mind that a man by that name had lived in a community of spiritualists that :had platted a village and opened a seminary at the place called Harmonia in Bedford township. By investi- gation just one other person was found in the city wl1o remembered the man. 'f aU madge was a member of the New York assembly from Dutchess county in r8z8; was state senator from r83o to 1834, and was elected United States. Senator in 1833, serving until 1844. September 16, 1844, he was appointed territorial governor of Wiscons·in, by Presi- dent Tyler, and served untii May 13, 1845· Tallmadge became imbued with the theories of Spiritualism and the ideas of Fourcerism, and co-operative commun- ity life ~eing advocated by Horace Greeley at that time, and came here to join the Bedford Harmonia! society. He was a very highly educated and cultured man and a gentleman of the old school. He suffered terribly from asth rna, and finally died at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Mary Boardman, in ~armonia, and his remains were taken to Fond du Lac, Wis., for burial. \-Detroit Free Press, Aug. I, 1904. Judge B. F. Graves of Detroit, recalls another inter- esting epi£ode in Tallmadge's career. Mr. Tallmadge was one of a number of senators of the Democratic party, who with the Whigs, opposed President Van Buren in his effort to estal;lish an independent treasury to take the place of the State banks. The Democrats formed a distinct body and gave themselves the name of \Conservatives.\ They found in Mr. Tallmadge an apt representative. In ·1840 they helped to elect Harnson and Tyler. \Mr. Tallmadge, however, lost favor as a public man. He failed to be elected senator, and though Mr. Tyler made him governor of the Terri- tory of Wisconsin, his star paled completely and he died near Battle Creek in semi-obscurity. I saw him once during his term as governor, and his presence sug- gested the possession of commanding ability. One word more: In June, 1841, I found myself at the Hermitage, near Nashville;' and was hor •. ored by a con- versation with Gen. Jackson. He allowed me to ask his .opinion of several eminent men, and among them was Mr. Tallmadge. The general was very outspoken9 and did not hesitate to question Mr. Tallmadge's po.liti · cal f1del occasior would r '40.- recentl) of the J •42.- Chicag 1904· Beside~ tady, a are the coltege.

8 THE CONCORDJENSIS. THE BIB:L:E STUDY CLASSES. The Leaders Announced. If there is one book that has stood the test of time and proved that its intrinsic value is far beyond that of all other books, that's the Bible. If there is one book that the average coHege man knows least about, that's the Bible. :Realizing this in recent years there has been a strong movement among AmericaB colleges in favor of coUege bible study. Classes have been orgaHized in almost all of the best known institutions, and Union has not been behind in this direction. Last year, the Bible classes under the direction of the Y. M. C. A., though small, were instructive and inter- esting, and this year the classes have been organized and the work will begin at once. The followmg are the leaders, their classes and the work to be covered. Freshman Class-Studies in the Life of Christ, McGregor, 'os. Sophomore Class-Studies in the Acts and Epistles, Lewis, 'o6. Junior Class-Studies in the Old Testament cl-iarac- ters, Hitt. 'o6. The leaders of the classes do not want to pose as teachers, but merely as directors of the courses. A hearty invitation is given to every student who realizes the need of a knowledge of the Bible as part of a full education, to join one of these classes. Y. M. C. A. NOTES. The Tuesday meeting of the Y. M. C. A. was ob- served as Mission-study rally. Dr. Kitchen, who for several years was a teacher in Japan~ was the princi- pal speaker. He gave a general survey of the more important mission fields and of the need of Christian men in those places. He concluded by urging the fel- lows to take up the study of missions, as offered in the Y. M. C. A. course, as a means of becoming informed on one of the great movements of the day. Mr. \,Yright. the leader of the mission study class, spoke of the need and benefits to be derived from the study ( Jf missions. Mr. McGregor gave an account of the work that had been done in mission study at Union and at other col- leges. He stated that during the year 1902-3, there were 6,674 students, in this country, in mission study classes and that during the year I903~4 there were 9,027. If the polides·of the different associatioNs are carded out, there will be over IJ,ooo in m~ission study classes this year. At ·Union, there were but ftve in the class last year.. This year, it ·is expected that at least double that number will enter the dass. Tbe book to be used this term is \Effective Workers in Needy F_ielrds. ,., It takes up the lives of David Livingstone of Africa; George L. Mackey of Pormosa; Isabella Thoburn of India; Cyrus Ham.Iin of Turkey, and Joseph Neesima of Japan. 'fh:e class will meet next Tuesday after the regular meet,ing to decide upon a regular time for meeting. All students are invited to join the class, The meeting next Tuesday night wid be led byNutt, 'o6. The subject of the meeting will be, '·Is it right to steal ideJs ?'' Through the kindness of the college librarian, the Y. M. C. A. reading room committee has procured the magazine covers formerly used in the college library, and placed them on the magazines in Silliman Hall reading room. The New York Herald has recently heen added tc our list of dailies; also several college .exchanges. THE LIBRARY. Rules Adopted by the Library Comm,ittee, October 12, 1904.

CO.LLE:GE CH·EERI;NG . \Ve do not venture to ·predict a howlincr ' . bo success in Union ,cheering, even if the students have become dissatisfied with the amount of noise they can make with their natural forces and have enlarged and extended by artificial ,means the aperture through which the sound usually issues. • Megaphones wHil increase the volunt-e of the sound; they win ease the see-saw grind on the throat; they will assist the players in hearing every rernark made on the sidelines, disparaging· or oth.erwise, and they will sor11e- what stimulate a ternptation to make the former kind of remarks on various occasions. But Union cheering isn't necessarily going to get first grade marks from now on, however rnuch it may be helped by outside sources. Union cheering doesn't depend on mega- phones to n1ake it known from the heights of Hamilton to the plain of N. Y. U. as typical Union cheering. If it does it's going to flunk. The men in front of the bleachers and the men behind the 'phones are· the ones who rn ust transform our cheering frorn an irregu 1ar pastime into a systetnatized duty. Three cheering leaders have been appointed If any new song·s are to be composed and sung, if any new yells are to be composed and yelled, if anytlzing in the cheering depart- n1ent is to be done, they nutst lead. If the students who will now attend four games on the campus in succession expect the cheering to becorne an important factor in every game, then they 11utst be led. Bryon's reputation as a poet and as one able to express lofty sentirnents, has been ter- ribly sn1irched in Sophon1ore circles. Son1e- body recalled that he once wrote '' On with the dance?\ Just because the days of rnany-colored Autu.tnn are here is no reason why the idol assurnes various hues almost nightly. - - Se cordi ,, I editc malt~ clare time posit tory posit com: tion to tl· less time con1 It ence stan .l\ny ahec: won A the any of t forn edit 111 0 G to c that oft] som T bod 1-Jatl at l I terr Col his

THE CONCOR.DIENSIS. II TO SE 1 PARATE THE CH'A:F:F. Section V. of the Constitution of the Con- cordiensis reads as follows : ''It shall be within the province of the editor-in- chief, with the approval. of the re- maining senior ,membelis of the board, to de- clare any position on the board vacant at any time during the year in case the ho:lder of the position fails to perform in a rn.anner satisfac- tory to the senior members the duties of his position. In such case he must enter into com petition with all candidates for the posi- tion and must stand with them a fair trial as to their respective ability, for a period ,of not less than four consecutive weeks, after which time the senior board shall select the best con1petitor to fill the vacant position.\ It is a self-evident truth that the mere pres- ence of a student's name on the staff doesn't stand for an .. increase in good to the paper. .l\. nyho\v this paper isn't expecting to go ahead very much by that rneans. And it won't either. After patient and careful investigation, the present senior board has failed to find any law or by-law which gives any member of the staff the right to feel that he is per- fanning his duty when he allows the senior editors to chase him all over the valley-green in order to give hirn an assignrnent. Going still further, the editors were unable to discover any legal support to the theory that they are sensitive about having men1 bers of the staff approach them \Vtth a request for something to do. CONDOLENCE. rfhe Concordiensis, representing the student body, extends to Dr. Ell·ery its heartfelt syn1- 1Jathy on the death of his wife which occurred at Hamilton, N. Y., on Tuesday last.

I2 THE COl\lCORDIENSIS. COLLEGE POLITICAL MEETINGS. Democrats Organize With Great Enthusiasm. On the even1ng of W edne:sday, O~ct. ili2th, the members of the student body who favor the De1nocratic party, assen1bled at SiNiman Hall for the purpose of organizing a Den1-ocratic club, in- tending it to be an important fa,ctor of this fall's can1paign. There were present in addition to these, about an equal nutnber of Republicans who hap- pened around for the purpose of being fair-minded. It was their wish to hear both sides of the political argument and they were willing to be converted if the Democrats should advance sufficiently con- vincing points. At the present time there are on the roll no nan1es of those who previously claimed to be Republicans, but while there is life there is hope. L. H. Peebles assumed the chair and called the meeting to order a1nidst thunderous applause. After stating the object of the gathering he intro- duced Mr. J mnes Cooper, '97, of Schenectady, as its speaker of the even1ng. (More thunder.) Mr. Cooper made an excellent address in which he proved without a question that the Democratic ticket was the only one for an an1bitious college man to vote for and showed conclusively that the Republican platforn1 is constructed of weak and rotten planks which stand for n1ilitarisn1, tariff and trusts. Mr. Cooper finished with an exhortation to all to join the ranks of Thon1as Jefferson's par- ty, and invited the club to attend the De1nocratic 1nass n1eetings in a body. The meeting then proceeded to elect officers as follows: President, George Hitt, 'o6. Secretary, E. G. Simons, 'os. Those who enrolled for metnbership 1n the club are: Si1nons, L. H. Peebles, J. B. Peebles, Ellenwood, Cabot, Totnlinson, Watson, Hitt, I-I unt, Davis, Cantwell, \Vebb, Stoney, Moore, Holleran, Goff, McGuirk, l\!Ionk, Raytnond, Closs en, Wheeler, Bartholomew, Bennett, Curtiss, Bishop, Patton.

At eight o'clock of the san1e evening, in Profes- sor Hoffrnan's room, the Republican club held its second meeting which was attended by about fifty tnen. The platform decoration consisted of a red, ·white and blue parasol upon which the portraits of Roosevelt and Fairbanks were set forth, athf on the handle was fastened a small automobile horn for 2.caring away bad luck President Wads worth took the chair ancl in a fevv words told how gratifying and encouraging it was to see the club turn out in such goodly nmn- bers, and announced that on account of illness .M~r. \V. Dewey Loucks, who was to have addressee. the gathering, would not be present that evening. Secretary Barnes read the 1ninutes of the pre- vious meeting, and the president introduced as the speaker of the evening Mr. Saln1on, Albany Law School, '04, of Schenectady, as the speaker of the eventng. l\tlr. Sahnon delivered a flowery and humorous speech and commenced by declaring it his inten- tion to eli1ninate the personal factor as he declared that it is not the candidate that the American cit- izen votes for, but the principles of the party which he represents. After reviewing the effects of the various admin- istrations upon the country at large and calling attention to the sterling qualities and high n1orals of the statesn1an whom the Republican party has advan~ed, Mr. Saln1on proceeded to expose Judge Herrick's 1nachinations and closed his address by congratulating the fellows upon their enthusiasm, and extended his best wishes to the1n in their en- deavors. The club voted to turn out in a body for the Re- publican n1ass 1neeting which was announced for October r8th. The following were appointed to con1pile sotne songs and yells: Giln1ore, chairman; Ray1nond and Ryder. 'I'he n1eeting then adjourned after arranging for another n1eeting on vV ednesday, Oct. the rgth. There were five new names added to the roll. They were: Elmendorf, Bryan, Mooers, Parsons, Hagar. The men1bership is now forty-five; Last Wednesday's n1eeting was postponed for a week because of its nearness to the mass meeting on Tuesday. F< Var out tl hard which Fordl ir.g t< he in1 Fo1 N. R.

THE COlvCORD'L!ElV.SIS. I1 FOOT BALL FOR THE WEEK. Varsity scri1nmage during the week has brought out the fact that Union's players will have to fight hard for the game today. R. P. I. has an eleven which practicing under the greatest difficulty held Fordham down to 22 points. While there is noth- ir.g to be derived from co1nparative scores it may he interesting to note the following: Fordhatn, 24; N. Y,. U., o. N. Y. U., s; Rochester, 6. R. P. I., o; Fordham, 22. It will be seen that R. P. I. is very nearly equal to Union, inastnuch as N. Y. U. was beaten by Fordhatn 24-o. and was defeated by Rochester s-6, the san1e score which defeated us. The situation behind the line is not very good. None of the backs are sure in handling punts. At quarter, Robinson, MacNab and Colburn are do- ing w~11 with ch~nces in favor of MacNab. Reeder is out for end and this is apt to make Davis' posi- tion anything bu~ sure. Von Dannen burg, Wright, Dann and Moore have been playing consistently although he fell off a bit last week N utt is better than Gilmour on the offensive but Giln1our out- classes N utt in defense. Kluge is still weak in his position on the defensive. Bill Sn1ith says that the tea1n ought to w1n the rest of the gan1es this season. THE HAMILTON GAME. Superior Playing Wins Exciting Contest For Hamilton. On Saturday last the football tea1n of Union College, acco1npanied by one hundred \rooters left for its annual battle with Hamilton. The day \Vas as fair as could be. desired and the trip very enjoyable. Arrived at Utica the boys went by trolley to Clinton and clilnbed the long hill which leads up to the college. The west bleachers were filled with the Union enthusiasts and the east with Hamilton 1nen. At 3 :IS the student body of Hamilton 1narched two abreast and headed by the village dru1n corps around the campus to their bleachers. At 3:30 the s' •Und of Hamilton's long yell announced the ar- rival on the field of their tean.1, and in a 1ninute or two the \Ray Ray, R.ah-Rah-Rah, Union!\ pro- clairn:ed. that the bors in· Garnet had n1ade their appearance. · Harnilton won the toss and chose the southwest goal. Patton kicked off to Stowell who ran the ba1:1 hack to his own 25 yard line. Hamilton push- ed Mann through the centre for three yards. A shift wing play was then tried and Bramley took the bal1l :for a quarterback run. He was not stop- ped 6N he had cirded Union's right end for 40 yar.cls and was tackled by Robinson just out of bounds. Again Ha.tnilton pounded the line but Stowe 1:1 fumbled and it was Union's ball. . H arnilton had got the ball on Union's 20 yard line l~·ut was penalized IS yards for holding. Bram- ley s:ttce eded in gett·in g a way from the Union play- ers andl making a spectacular run of r8 yards. The baH \vas brought back because I-Ia1nilton han held agm n. The san1e tactics were tried but vV ri o-ht b downed Bram.ley be fore he had gained an inch. Sicard then punted and the ball went straight up in the an. Bramley caught it and for this the baH was gi1·en to Union. Harvey and Moore failed to gain and Patton had to kick Ha1nilton was penalized IS yarcls for holding and Union ro yards for offside play. Han1ilton braced and sent the backs against the Union line which yielded unti 1 the ball rested em. the IS yard line when the half ended. 1'he second half began with a whirlwind start. Union could not gain after the kickoff. H an1i1- ton \vas then gi \'en the ball and started to rush it strongly down the :field. Mann and Stowell 1nade good gains through the Union line and B ran1ley heJ.t::>ed along with a trick play culn1inating in and end r·un. Haggerson \vas shoved along for a good gain and the ball went to Ha1nilton on Union's two yard line. Mann was shoved over the line for a toucl1down and B1·amley missed an easy goal. Score s-o. I-Ian·ey received tl1'e ball on the kickoff. The Union line had b.een battered to such an extent thal Cook was substituted for Davis. Norwood for Klttge, Shntler for Wright, MacNab for Robinson, and Becker for Rayn1ond in rapid sucession and

The ball was in Union's territory during the entire game and nearly always in Hamilton's possession. We were outweighed and outplayed but it does seen1 as if some of the n1en, especially Patton, Moore and N utt could have played just a wee bit harder. It is not the purpose of this article to gloss over the game and say that we held them to one touchdown, but to say that it was only by the greatest good fortune that the final score was as it was. Our team. is too slow as regards trick plays. How n1any times the hearts of the fellows sank when Bramley tried a fake play through the end and then turned quickly back to centre to find it just as he expected, with beautiful vistas of the autumn foliage and the distant tnountains appear- ing where our centre ought to be. Bill Stnith has brought the boys up to play straight football and they can do it too, but they must pay a little 1nore attention to the trick plays of opposing teams. Credit must be given to Robinson, Wright, Harvey, Von Donnenburg and Davis who got into the gan1e from every ldckoff. Notes of the Game. 1-Iatnilton' s songs an.d yells for the occasion were fine. Union should get busy and have a few new ones for the remaining gan1es. * * * * H the s.eniors, who are .so opposed to the old ''series,\ could have heard it yelled at the Utica depot :Saturday they. might realize that it stiH ha~ more vim in it than any yell we have. * * * * There was a scarcity of Union pennants, mega- phones an:d n1odern cheering apparatus at the ga1ne. * * * * Hatl)ilton is to be congratulated on the courte- ous methods of her trea tm.ent toward us. * * * * The hill leading to the Hamilton campus made Union tnen glad that they were in Union. * * * * Mr. Garis and Mr. Cunningham are to be con- gratulated on their college spirit. * * * * Would you rather be a \Frosh\ or a \Slimer.\ About the Trip. About last Monday the trip looked as if it tnight be composed of the team only inastnnch as so lit- tle spirit was shown. As the time for the trip drew nearer several showed their desire to accon1pany the team and aid them in their quest for gore. When the 8:46 train pulled out of Schenectady last Saturday it had roo loyal sons of the Garnet on hoard. The journey to Utica was a delight both owing to the condition of the weather and the confidence which the fellows had in the tean1. The crowd arrived in Utica in good season and amused the citizens of that peaceful town with a few \gentletnanly\ college yeils, leaving the \osky- wow-wow\ off in every case. Frotn Ut\ica to Clinton the trip is by trolley; jo1ting, jumping trolley. When you finally disen- tangle yourself you wake to the fact that there is a hill to be climbed before the college is reached. a hill like the Acropolis at Athens perhaps or sitnilar to M t. Ararat or upper State St. The location of the college pays for the climb up, however, and one forgets, in the beauty of the surroundings, the pull up.

The first intercbss football game between the Fresh- men and Sophomores proved to be a very exciting . contest. Barring an occasional fumble the game was one of many individual plays. The 35 yard run, for a touchdown by Mulrooney in the first half, was the feature of the ga:n:Te. Maure did good work for the Sophomores by repeat- edly making gains of 10 and 15 yards.

Hamilton Will Meet Union in the Spring. \Vhi1e at Clinton last week President King of the Tennis Association spoke to Ha1nihon rep- resentatives in regarcl to a tnatch with then1. Hamilton is very anxious to play Union and a tneet with them in the spring is assured. The meet will take place in Schenectady on the college courts whech will be put in repair. Han1ilton Life ·says of tennis: \There is no reason if Hamilton receives the support in this branch of athletics why she should not rank with the first of the New York State colleges.\ The outlook for a successful tean1 is fairly bright here. Some good n1aterial has developed in the freshn1an class and there is no doubt that Union will make the match an extr.en1ely interesting one. At present there is a great deal of interest being taken in tennis and a fall tourna1nent is now going. on. Most of the preliminaries have been played and the winners of these will con1pete this week. The list of those entered is as follows: Raymond 'os Read 'o7 Chapman 'o6 Colburn 'o8 E. ]. King 'os ·vincent 'o8 Tho1npson 'os Cabot 'o8 Dwight 'o6 Keith 'o8 Brooks 'o6 Hoffman 'o8 MacMullen 'o7 Tom.linson 'o8 Suier· '07 Snow 'o8 . Briggs '07 Bartholomew 'o8 BASE BALL AVERAGES FOR 1904. Hagar Leads the Batting-Rider the Field ... . In g. It is to be regretted that the averages given be~ low have had to be held back until the {nterest in then1 is rather lukewarm. Next spring, the 111anagement may introduce an innovation by appointing a regular scorer to ac- company the team on its trips, a.nd to keep an accnra.te record throughout the season of the in- dividual showing of the players. Most colleges do this, hut here at Union it has api)J.rent1y not been thought necessary. Aided by the kindness of A. H. Child, editor of

THE CONCORDJENSJS. Hamilton Life, who provided the score of the Han1ilton- Union game at Hamilton when the Union record had been lost, the averages can now be published. The team both 1n its batting and fielding was decidedly below the marks of Union baseball tean1s for the seasons of 1902 and 1903. The fielding shows much 1nore consistent team playing than the batting w hid1 offers only two n1·en batting over ·300. Figures do not always count however. It hap- pens many tin1es that a player who is not even an1ong the leaders in either his batting or fielding is nevertheless one of the strongest factors on the tea1n for a victory. Fielding.

Good Material in Freshmen Class, Brought Out by lnter .. Class Meet Yesterday. Good material in Freshman Class, as brought out by Inter-class M,eet yesterday. The track n1eet, which took place yesterday afternoon, made evident the fact that the 'varsity teatn would be sotnewhat strengthened by the ad- dition of excellent tnaterial :from the freshtnan class. The training for the various events brought out several fast freshtnen sprinters and distanc-e n1en, who with proper training in the spring will n1ake a strong contingent to add to the tean1 for the rneets with the other colleges. Captain Raytnond, in an interview, said that his hopes were bright for a successful season. All the sprints, n1iddle and distance runs were covered in fairly good time; the ha1nn1er throw and the var- ious j u:mps brought out able representatives, and so far it is safe to expect at least equal chances. with other institutions. In one respect, however, our tean1 is inefficient. Not enough fellows seetned to take interest in the hurdle races. Now there is no doubt that there is n1uch needed rnaterial for the hurdles in college and Captain Rayn1ond hopes that i\n the spring there will be more interest shown in that event. Owing to the lateness in the week of the meet. it is itnpossib1e to give the winners of the various events in this issue .

The Employment Bureau which was instituted last year and so successfully conducted under the \ supervision of Dr. Stoller, has again resutned its work and, it is needless to say, every effort is be- ing made by the co1nmittee in charge to accotn- plish the desired purpose of the institution. Since the opening of the college year, the Bureau has succeeded in obtaining positions for t\velve applicants, whereby these students, during leisure hours, n1ay earn from $r.so to $4:00 weekly. So far, the results have equalled, if not sur- passed the expectations of the student body and the excellent work of the Bureau gives assurance of another successful season.

THE VOL. XXVIII. FRA TERNlTY SPIRIT vs. COLL!EGE SPIRIT. Views of an Alumnus. This subject is one that can be brought to the minds of the student body at any time. At all times there is much discussion of ways to arouse college spirit. These outbursts are most apparent on the eve of some athl,etic contest. But there is need to have it on tap aU the time. There has always been apparent at Union a sacrific- ing of college spirit to fraternity spirit. Is this as it should be? There can be but one answer. The fraternity is the outgrowth of the college and as such owes its existence to the college. The general belief of the \frat\ man, at least from his attitude, seems to be that the college exists for the fraternity. Everything is sacrificed for the apparent honor of his fraternity. Deals which would have done credit to Boss Tweed are made all for the paltry honor that one of his fraternity should be some class officer. Games are lost that one of his own men may play in that game. This may be picturing an extreme case but accusa· tions such as these have been made. If there were no cause for them they would not be made. Such a frater- nity spirit is an unjust one. The fraternity as a d1apter is thereby weakened, the individual man is losing his sense of honor and greatest of all college spirit is bemg lost. When this is gone the college ceases to exist as a living, active institution, the fraternities, having chapters there, withdraw their charters, and the occu- pation of the narrow minded \frat\ man is gone. There can be no remedies for such things and the fraternity system can be a great power in furnishing the remedy-one that can do an immense atnount of good in engendering college spirit into the undergraduate and retaining the interest of the college alumni. This may be accomplished in at least three ways-first in training its own members, second in making friends outside of the chapter and third by selecting the best man for the place. No.6 There is no need to mention methods or ways to in- spire spirit into the undergraduate fraternity man. Each fraternity probably has its own meth@ds-the suc- cess of which is known to themselves. If this training is no narrow one then the man will be bvowgh t to see that :it is for the good of his college, his fraternity and hi~mseif that he make friends outside of his own cirde. Men in the uppe-r classes know only too well how narrow their range of friendship is. Theve are with only few exceptions, no men with whom they are really acquainted and then they do not becom:e so until they are ready to part. Friends and acquai ntan ~es are of estimable advantage to any one, and they will prove . especial'ly so when the college man goes out to battle against the world. This can be remedied. Each frater· nity caa entertain a class at a time at a smoker. The \gym'\ can be obtained for college smokers. At these gatherings every man should make it his :personal duty to see that all his acquaz'ntances are there. College songs, some old al urn ni to tell incidents of games and meets of their day will aid materially. Addres~es by captains and managers and other well known men in college will inspire enthusiasm. Have members of the faculty there. Let every one be there to see and 1 o be seen, to acquaint themselves and to becorne acquainted. Campus meetings, class whist tournaments, billiard tournaments, all such affairs ought to be turned to advantage. After the man's playing has been seen, after the man's worth has been proven and the man become known, then and only then can the best man be selected for the place. Let every man with the interests of 'Old Union at heart ponder over these things. Becotne acquainted with each other. Eliminate these deals and vote for the 111an, not for the faction. Do Hot let it be said .of Union, the mother of fraternities, that these fraternity spirit {Ounts more than college spirit; rather let it be said that fraternity spirit and college spirit are working together to the immense advantage of both. UNIUS, 'o4.

6 THE CONCORDJE1\TSJS. ==~==~~==========================================~========~==~. DR. NOTT'S WAY. A New Anecdote of the Great President. Being· asked once whether he had any personal recollection of Dr. N ott, Dr. J mnes R. Truax '76, replied: \'01 I . J, no. He was dust and a shadow before I entered college. All I encounte,red of hin1 was the old coffin stove in n1y college room, and a n1ore elaborate mantel stove in the parlor of the resi- dence I occupied for tnany years, and the tradi- tions that floated about at commencement. The late Alexander H. Rice, once governor of Massa- chusetts, told me this story about Dr. N ott's mode of dealing with offending students. To understand the point; of it, it is necessary to remetnber that it relates to a time when postage was high and could be paid either by the sender or the receiver of a letter, also to hear in n1ind that the young 1r1an with whotn the doctor had the interview was the son of a worthy but extretnely penurious father.\ The story as told by Dr. Truax is as follows: The boy had becotne troublesome to the faculty and Dr. N ott had sutnn1oned him to his presence. ~'l\fy son,\ said the doctor, \I am sorry to lea;n that you are neglecting your studies and spending your time in ways not altogether creditable. I have great confidence in you, nevertheless, and if you will give me your word that you will at once am end your ways, I will give you an opportunity to remain. Otherwise, I will have to ask your father to take you home.\ To this the young tnan replied: \\Vel1 doctor, you have such a good opinion of rny word, that I fear to make any promise, lest I should break i~t, and destroy your regard for tne.\ \V cry we11, then, I will write to your father to take you off n1y hands.\ The president stiffly bowed, and the young n1an withdl·ew. As soon as the door had be en closed between them, each felt that he had gone further than he intended. The president concluded he would recall the student and offer him another chance to re- deetn himself, promise or no promise, and the young man decided that he would go back and tell Dr. N ott that he would rather n1:ake a pledge to do better than to be sent home. Both took hold of the door knob at the san 1 e instant, and each immediately recognized the change of mind undergone by the other. 'conse- quently when the door was ·opened each had recov- ered his fanner firmness. \We'll!\ said the doctor. \W eH !\ said the young man. \You have decided to give lne yo·ur word, I pre- sume.\ \Oh no! I nrere:ly caTne back to say that if you write 1ny father, you should be certa,in to pay the postage in advance; otherwise he will never take the letter fron1 the office and I will be left on your hands after all.\ President. N ott, it is said, concluded that it was worth his while to keep so clever a lad, and the letter was never written. THE VESPER SERVICE. Rev. Robert C. Clements, '9:1 , Speaks. A large number was present at the vesper service Sunday afternoon. In the absence of President Mac- Gregor, Vice-President West assumed the leadership. The opening prayer was given by the Rev. Harvey Clements, '95, a brother of the principal speaker, both of whom are Union graduates. After a few words of introduction by Mr. West, who alluded to the inability of D-r. Ellery to be present, the Rev. Robert C. Clements began a !il1ost interesting address, the text of which is to be found in He b. 6: 1, attention also being called to the dosing: verses of chap- ter five. The theme of the discourse was Christ's per- fection as exemplified in His life. Mr. Clements said that every step toward perfection signified a certain growth in character and likeness to Christ. Repent- ance of itself cannot mould a Christian character although it may enter largely into the progress man makes toward Christ-likeness. d The spirit of the times for a greater physical an mental development was alluded to, and emphasis was placed. upon the attention which should be given to man's spiritual advancement. ''There is great need,'' said Mr. Clements, \of men of righteousness and high ideals in the Reft in wh exhor1 Mr. Thorn concei Adam quenct proof physi( althoL emboc depra' qua lit establ Inc of res notre or to the H Th1 follov Kapp Sigm Delta Psi {

THE CONCORDJENSJS. ideals and for men who seek to mould their characters in the likeness of Jesus Christ.'' Reference was made to the \Sermon on the Mohlnt'' in which Jesus, Himself, was the embodiment of the exhortation. Mr. Clements said that we are apt to' doubt as did Thomas, because we have not yet arrived at a clear .conception of what God':;, relation to man really is. Adam did not maintain that relation and as a conse- quence a veil was drawn between him and his God. As proof of this relation Mr. Clements referred to the physical likeness of Jesus and man, and said that although we do not see Christ, yet man himself is the embodiment of God's great work, and no matter how depraved or sunken he may be there is always some quality in him by virtu~ of which his kinship to God is established. In clos.ing Mr. Clements advised against the tendency of resorting to religion as a panacea for all our ills and not really understanding what God and religion mean, or to quote his last few words,-\ Let us know Him, the Hope and Only Hope.\ FRATERNITY INITIATES.

THE :CONCO·RDIENSIS' .. =====================================================================================- ~ COLLEGE BRIEFS. The Musical Clubs have announced tb.a:t the first CQncert of the season will be held in the Emmanuel Baptist church., in Nott terrace, on the evening of November I$. Dr. Ellery wa<s unable to return to his duties this week but it is expected that he will be in his class room next Monday morning as usual. The Freshmen scored one on the Sophomores when they painted the Idol red with a white balild around its chest. From a distance it looked almost as beautiful as one of the 1907 jerseys. The \parade\ after the R. P. I. game Saturday was the closest the fellows have come to sho,wing colleg.e spirit in some time. It made many of the citizens of Schenectady think of the time when Union ranked among the first of the smaller Cl>lleges and when a de- feat was the exception and not the rule. Let us have more \parades.\ Kluge was struck by a trolley car while walking down Union avenue, Wednesday. The accident hurt the car more than it did Kluge. This speaks well for Bill Smith and the training table. The instrumental and glee clubs had a group picture taken on Tuesday. The plate will be used for adver~ tising purposes. The Sophomore football team will play Albany High School, at Albany, on Monday. The game ought to be an interesting one. At the meeting of the A delphic society on last Wed- nesday, the question debated was: Resolved, That there should be a third political party. Losee, 'o5, was the leader for the affirmative, and Hart, 'o5, for the negative. The debate was decided for the affirmative. Next Wednesday the question to be brought up before the Adelphic society is: Resolved, That the acts of Uie United States government, in regard to Panama, deserve our disapproval. Thompson, 'os, will lead the affirmative, and McClenthen, 'o6, the negative. On account of the muddy state of the campus the Junior-Sophomore football game, scheduled for last Wednesday, was postponed. Mr. Smith, substitute professor of Chemistry, has returned to Hamilton, New York, where he holds the pos1tion of assistant professor of Chemistry in Colgate University. Schenectady High School played Troy High School on the campus, Thursday. The score was 1 r-o m favor of Troy. Strong, '99, was .a visitor at the H. P. I. game. President Raym.ond attended the exercises connected with the inauguration of President Luther at Trinity college. In the procession the representatives of the universities formed in order of the date of the f.ound.ing oftheirinstitutions, President Raymond was thirteenth, being preceded by the presidents ·Of Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Rutgers, 'Dartmouth, Dickinson, Williams and Bowdo,in. The Junior cane£ have been ordered and will soon be here. Several of the 1904 men, Mullen neaux, Stiles, Fiero, Lawsing, Hays, Putnam and Guardenier, were on the hill Saturday. Several Junior caps with a mystic symbol have ap_ peared on the campus recently. A Third Party? Was it's? The Fresh men Jerseys have come. They are of the same style as 1907's. The colors are garnet and black. Ye ancient Greeks and Romans were taker, out for an airing lately to the evident discomfiture of at least one of their number. Theodore DeL. Coffin, 'oz, was visiting friends on the hill last Monday. After the R. P. I. game a number of students got together and paraded down State street with a large Union pennant belonging to Chapman, 'o6. Pay up ! Work on the skating rink cannot begin until the money is in hand. It is expected that the rgo6 Garnet will make its ap- pearance in January instead of during the Spring term. The Sophomores and Freshmen of the high school, met in a football game on the campus, Saturday morn~ ing, which was won by the latter by the score of I I too All individua I pictures of Juniors, for the Garnet, must be taken at MacLean's sccessor, White, before. October z8. Smith and Gilmour are attending the Delta Upsilon national convention at Chicago. COLLEGE ME·ETING.

How pleasant it is to view the joys of child- hood! What a privilege to behold on the campus every afternoon, Stl nday included, the innocent intrusions and the bubbling over of unrestrained mirth. BackJo our own infantile days it takes us, when we used to rotnp over a coUege campus. We just owned that ca·rnpus, we did. l\. cop didn't dare both,er us theFe. It was private land. Remetn ber how all the kids fron1 all over the city used to come around every afternoon? \i\1 e'd sit on the benches and hear the students swear because we wouidn't give thern any room. 0, it was great. It used to be fun, too, for all of us to go on the field and bother the 'varsity footfall tean1 in its practice. Lots of times they stopped just for us. l)idn't it make the coach rnad though ? The Faculty always seemed to like us. We used to play all around the buildings. No- body ever said anything except a student once in a while when we would hook sorne of his things. The games too--it was great sport to sneak in them and dodge around the foot ball manager. We were n1ost afraid of a big man who was treasurer, or collector, or supervisor, or something, but he couldn't keep watch over the whole campus. Sotnetimes we had son1e of the best seats at the games too. Wasn't it fun to yell things at· everyone who can1e around up there? The fellows a11 said the campus was the best place to smoke and swear and scrap and play of any in the city. We just owned those college grounds, w~ did.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. II NOTHING SUCCEEDS WITHOUT SUPPORT Manager Stevens of the Musical Associa- tion, is to be congratulated on the way he has taken hold of the work in arranging for the concerts and trips to be given ip the near future. The con1bined Musical Clubs have had a group picture taken which will be used for advertising. This alone shows the spirit and interest taken in that branch of college activities. It is the purpose of the clubs to give a con- cert . in Schenectady about the I sth of November and about that tin1e one 1n Mechanicsville and one in Gloversville. At Thanksgiving tin1e if all goes well a four days trip will be taken. H.eed, 'o6, leader of the clubs, has been working hard to prepare the n1en for these concerts. There are two rehearsals a week and n1uch is being accomplished at these meetino·s b .• The students are turning out \vell and lots of tna terial has shown up. There are twenty n1en on the Glee Club and about the same number on the Instrumental Club. The interest shown is of the best and should be encouraged as n1 uch as possible. The college is to be ably represented this season in this line, and those college men not taking an active part should be ready at all tin1es to support the efforts of the association. The best -vvay to do this is to sho\Y you are behind it, and the way to do that is to pay up all taxes. Elsewhere 1n these columns we print a charming story about President N ott from the Gazette, to which it was contributed by Dr. James R. Truax, '76, who reached it as an incident of hi acquaintance with the late Governor of Ma'\s', Alex. H, Rice, '44. We think that there may be n1any tradi- tions of Dr. N ott that rnight fittingly be pre- served and we heartily invite alun1ni to s-end them for publication in the columns of this paper. WE SLEPT. And dreatned that Wadsworth, president of the Rep.ublican Ctub, occupied a carriage in the parade last Thursday night. And drean1ed that the students of Syracuse un- veiled a 1nen1ori·al tablet to their Chancellor for prohibiting dancing in the university. A11d drea1ned that Morse, captain of the senior football teatn, 1nade the All-An1erica11. And drea1ned that Judge Parker sent the Union College Den1.ocratic Club his thanks for its active, enthusiastic and effective can1paign. And drea.tned that the ''co-eds'' of Minnesota so hurt the feelings of the tnale students by their snubs that the upper-dassn1en apologized .for un- gentletnanly conduct and decided to re-adopt the custo1n of tipping their hats. And drean1ed that the Philon1athean and Adel- phic tneetings were so strongly a ttendecl that n1any were turned away. \Even as the Son of Man.\ By REV. ARTHUR DOUGALL. Union '92. Matt. 20: 25-28. The selfish spirit of the world Seeks riches, place and power. Heedless of others' cares and needs \Vhen storn1s of trouble lower. Though earth with sorrows 1nay be filled vVith tears, and groans, and sighs, The selfish heart ignores it all And still pursues the prize. But in the kingdon1 of our Lord Let not this strife unseemly Find any place; let love alone In all things reign supren1ely. Who bears the cross for Jesus' sake, And lives His life of love, Shall sit with Hin1 upon His throne, And wear the crown above. Not lost, but sav'd eternally, The life for others given; For God is love, and love is life, The endless life of heaven.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. FOOT BALL FOR THE WEEK. Practice has developed the fact, that the teatn has improved during the week. Norwood at right guard is a distinct move for the better while Shulter and MacNab n1ust now play right end and quarter respectively. Robinson's knee gave out at Thursday's practice and Wright is laid up with water on the knee. The line up for Rutgers ga,tne wiil he the same as for last Saturday with the above exceptions. The teatn has itnproved 111 offense and teatn work, and it is doubtful if it can be truthfully said as the Hatnilton life mentioned in the last issue: ''Hatnilton completely outclassed Union on offense and with any kind of luck earned three touch- downs. Union's offense barely gained 20 yards throughout the game but her defence at critical moments was of the stonewall nature.\ There has been in1proven1ent shown all around and the tea111 is in good shape to show Rutgers a thing or two on the gridiron today. It is the critical point of the season and the success of the season hinges largely on today's game. We are pitted against a tean1 whose rec- ord below conveys strongly to us the fact that we have got to win. The Springfield Republican says of the Wesley- an-Rutgers game: \The two teatns were evenly tnatched in weight. Hrogger at left tackle was the lone star of the Rutgers tean1. Wesleyan gained her distance at will through her opponent's line and in three min- utes had gained her first touchdown. All during the first half Wesleyan backs gained easily. At the beginning of the second half Rutgers took a brace and using tackle backs forn1ation carried the ball to \Vesleyan's IS yard line when it was lost on downs.;' There is a possibility that practice has developed Rutgers to such an extent that the contest will be a hard one for Union to win but according to present indications we ought to win easily. The Rutgers line-up: Green, 1. e.; Bragger, 1. t.; Black, 1. g.; Tharp, c.; Koehler-Steinke, g.; vV at son, r. t.; Murray W. MacNeill, ·e.; Weaver-].

Rutgers vs. Wes1eyan-0-39· ) IN THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED, WAY. R. P. I. Decisive 1 ly Defeated on the Campus. For the :first time since rgor, Union's team has, by superior playing and lasting qua:lities, succeed- ed in crossing her opponent's goal line ~ve times during the course of an hour's play, and that with- out having her own goal seriously threatened once. R. P. I. brought over a fair-sized delegation and .at the request of President Raytnond the bleachers on the west of the campus were reserved for then1, Union's rooters contenting themselves with their old standing place at the foot of the mound. The new megaphones were very much in evi- dence and those far enough ren1ov·ed to be able to judge, said that they added largely to cheering. Owing to the new ground rule, that play must stop before sundown, effort was made to get the gan1e started as soon as possible, but it was three- thirty before the players finally took their places, R. P. I. defending the north goal. Union won the toss and chose the south goal. Jaeger kicked off to Moore on Union's IS yard line and he ad\ranced it 20 yards before being downed. After the tean'l failed twice to penetrate R. P. I.'s lin'e, Patton punted 40 yards to Ellner, who was downed in his tracks by Kluge. Rens selaer, by line bucks and plays. outside of tackle, carried the ball 20 yards, but there ftunbled and Nutt dropped on the hall on Union's 43 yard line.

E. church, will speak at the Vesper service Sunday at 5 o'clock. His subject will be\ AreCcllege-bred Men the Best Citizens.\ Prof. Ellery, on accGunt of the death of his wife, was unable to speak at the Vesper service last Sunday. On account of the non -arrival of the text books, the meeting of the mission-study class was postponed one week. The meeting Tuesday night will be led by President McGregor. The subject will be ''Hampered Racers.\ These Tuesday night meetings are conducted very informally. After the leader has given a general idea of the topic for the evening, the remaining time is spent in a general discussion of it by those present. Recently there has been much interest in these discussions, and often all have not had the opportunity to speak, who desired to, on account of lack of time. Every fdlow in college, whether a member of theY. M. C. A. or not, is cordially invited to attend not only the Tuesday meetings but also the Sunday afternoon meetings. Y. M. C. A.
