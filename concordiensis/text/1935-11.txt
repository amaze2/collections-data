P, I, Last Saturday Tomorrow the freshman football team will invade Cole Field, Wil- liamstown, intent on removing the yearlings of WiJ.liams from the un- defeated class. Nels Nitchman and his band of Garnet players, 25 ::;trong, will leave Schenectady by bus at 7:45 Saturday morning in order to be ready for the opening at 12 o'clock. For the first time this · season, every man on the squad is in first class physical shape. Wi Iliams will be playing its sec\ ond game of the year. In its first encounter last week the Purple triumphed over Middlebury's frosh, 13-0. Coach Bill Fowle, former Ephrnen star, ha·s a squad of 40 men. The team is not as husky as R. P. 1. was, but is considerably faster. The heavy duty back is Pete Seay, who scored both the touchdowns against Middlebury. Same Team to Start Before practice Thursday Nitch· man made it known that the same eleven which commenced against R. P. I. will function tomorrow. Bill Thomas, 131 pound speedster, who put on a track meet last Sat- urday, will be at quarter. Bob Ter- hune and Bob Garnett are slated for ha:Ifback posts, with Jake Amazon, the powerful defensive ·and blocking back at full. Paul Teare, whose play has improved rapidly of late, gets the call over Doug Stevenson at left guard. Hen- Coach G. Elliot Hatfield has lJeen experimenting during the .pa:ot week, and as a result, two players have found new berths.

Marotta replaces Campbell at the •center point in an effort to pUt. =ore spark Into the line. The· second shift is the changing of .fack:S]oat- man ·fvom tackle to end, where he will be back in his old statuJ)ing grounds, for he played end' on 'last year's varsity. The rest of tl1e line will ·remain intact, with Milan-() at end,· and Gatchell, Potts, :Ke~tns and Bullard in their reg-ular posi- tions. The two meets which the Garnet have drop~ed have both been very close. Three points in the Vermont encounter and one in the R. P. I. meet were the determining factors in scoring- the Union silksters with losses. According to Coach Ketz, the runners are now at the peak or near peak form and he gave the harriers tlleir last six-mile run of the year early in the week.

Today every other movement ·is suppressed, and the Hitler-Jugend claims 5,000;000 members who are being trained in mind, spirit and body to follow the Fuehrer unquestioningly and to have the strength to do his will. To accomplish the same purpose and to give a certain amount of physical training, the young Nazis are sent to camps for two weeks perhaps every other summer, and at least once to one of the big camp.;, where it is considered the youngsters can be really taught what Nazism means. At the Hochland Lager, which we visited, in Southern Bavaria, there were 4,000 boys, besides 1,200 Ger- man boys from foreign countries in Germany for two months at the invitation of the Nazi government. Everything in the camp was, of course, carried on like a mi.Jitary encampment, with rows of tents, rollin15 kitchens, a huge drillground, sentnes, and a great deal of salut- ing. Although the Hitler-Jugend have as yet no arms of any kind, a considerable part of their daily activities is concerned with mili- DR. ERNST M.

As in Italy, the units are organized along mili- tary lines, and the whole movement is divided into four parts, the Hit- ler-Jugend pvoper, boys from 14-18, the Young Folk, boys from 10-14, and girls of the same ages.

The car- toonist places the spoken words of his characters in a small balloon at the top of the picture; his object is to make his readers forget the balloon, and instead, to look upon and understand it as, the dialogue of his subjects. Modernistic Art Modernistic art is the most glar- ing example of misunderstood ex- pressionism today. \Ignorance said Doctor Johnson, \is egotistical; when a man is unable to under- stand a work of art, he is likely to regard the artist as ignorant. Art- ists speak a language a:nd we must make an effort to understand it; I don't know how sincere the ex- treme modernists are; they may be recording their dreams and visions, or they may be merely exploiting a new toy but we must not pass juqg- ment on them until we, ourselves. have made a sincere effort to un· derstand their work.\ Doctor Johnson concluded with a plea to the students to become bet- ter acquainted with the az tists of the printed page; he requested that they seek to acquit·e greater skill in both the reading and writing of English. \We who teach English, urge you to seek eagerly for an in- creased understanding of the com· mon language; you will spread out your enjoyments and greatly enrich your pleasures in life.\ \Vhen Dr. Ernst M. Ligon ad- dresses the first regular meeting of the Union chapter of Sigma Xi on \Experimenting With Personality\ 15 r:ncmbets of his advanced class in the psychology laboratory to- morrow night in experimental psy- chology will give demonstrations of various apparatus used in testing subjects in the research which Dr. Ligon will describe. This meeting will be open to the public and is the first one in many years in \Vl-tich a group of undergraduates has participated. '\I'he basis of the senior class in advanced psychology concerns it- self with character research,\ ex- plained Dr. Ernest Ligon when questioned about the plans for the coming Sigma Xi lecture. \We will therefore attempt to describe the background of character research by calling upon the 15 students to perform demonstrations pertaining to child psychology.\ Has Studied Tests During the year, the psychology class has studied many tests which have been given to children at vari- ous research laboratories in the different universities throughout the country. Most of the demon- strations at the Sigma Xi meeting will be based on the theory that every child excells in some partic- ular field. They will be used for the intent purpose, therefore, of finding In just what pursuit a child is good. Some of the demonstrations will be a visual attention test which attempts to determine by the use of an apparatus which flashes al- ternately lines and words, the effi- ciency of the subject to calculate the exact number of these flashes, and a mechanical aptitude test which essays to forcast the ability of the subject in mechanical occu- pat·ions. There will be intelligence tests, and a Pintner Patterson per- fol'mance test, a memory and learn- ing test which employs maizes and other intricate divices, and a prob- lem solving test, which gives vari- ous simple problems for the young child to solve. Th.e demonstz ations will be per- formed on guests of Sigma Xi if they ai\e willing to serve as sub- jects. \\'ill Explain Program Dr. Ligon's address \Experimen- ting with Personality\ will simply desc1ibe the character zesearch program. \Character Psychology,\ <Continued on Page 4) Mr. Charles M.

Now the Terrace Councilmen have one chance left to redeem the dollar and a half which the Student Council pays for each ponderous key. They have been put in charge of Spring Night and the annual in- terfraternity song contest. This event has been sloppily managed during recent years, and inte1·est in the .song contest has lan- guished. If the Terrace Council can do some- thing to 1·evive Spring Night, they may go to their reward with a clear conscience. several thousand candle power widely varied entertainment as is more than he needed.

But A man. :wbo cannot respond to negro spirituals has a heart of stone and a brain devoid of gray matter, f<>r this genre reaches the highest .plane of musical sublimity. All folk music as a rule, by vir- tue of its simplicity, ranks among the noblest fruits produced. Negro folk music is in a class by itself because of the inherent musical genes in the negro race. Ostensibly, wearing g1·een-l.mttoned caps, keeping off the gl'ass, and greeting all upper- classmen are supposed to initiate the first yeur men into the spirit and traditions of Union College, and to foster class solidarity. Actually, freshmen regard the rules as slightly unpleasant tasks to be followed as sketchily as circumstances and the Sopho- more Discipline Committee permit. 'The freshman rules tend to have a nega- tive instead of positive effect upon habits of ih..e student body as a whole. There are no disti11guishing articles of dress for the upper class~s except for seniors at commencement. Walking· on the grass becomes a pleasant privilege to upperclassmen largely becaus.e it ha<i been forbidden to them as freshmen. Greeting fellow-students when one meets them on the campus is a pleasant custom if one likes it. But there are some people who cannot say \Hello' 'to strangers comfortably. And ce1tainly the custom is not made habit- ual !J~· enforcing it on all freshmen. The real cause of freshman rules lies deeper than the glib rationalizations listed in the handbook. They are vestiges of older, crueler, and more childish hazing customs. By ridicule, sartorial segTegation, and petty restt-ictions on the freshmen, the three upper classes holster their own doubtful superior- ity. The rules are not made for the educa- tion of the newcomers, but rather for the sadistic enjoyment of the oldsters. Witness the gleeful reception of yesterday's paddling.

High Scorer in the East After Bill Moseley had talten Stanton's center alley pass, and run for a touchdown aided by splendid down field blocking, Wil- liams devoted their efforts to see- ing how many times Stanley could score. They succeeded rather well. Before the game, he had been sec- ond in eastern scoring with eight touchdowns and one conversion to his credit. Afterwards he was out in front by reason of the four scor- ing runs he had added. T'he vVH- liams coach, Charley Caldwell, was not content to win by two or three touchdowns. Seeking revenge for last year's defeat, he allowed his first eleven to remain in action tht'ougbout the greater part of the game although the reserve team he threw in (notably Doug Stearns and Stradley) had power and drive. In the fourth period, after Stan- ley had chalked up his last score on a beautiful twenty-three yard gallop around left and, the Garnet put on their second real offensive of the game and scored. Ernie Brown I'eturned the kickoff twenty-six yards from the goal line and picked up a first down with three off-tackle clants. T'ben he cut a short pass over the cen- ter of the line to Emery Burton who made a sensational shoestring catch and run. The pass and run ~overed sixty yards for the touch- down. It was the first time this year that a pass had been complet- ed for a score agll,inst the Pui.'ple defense, and only the fourth touch- down of any sort that they had allowed. * * * Van Ladd, the sophomore tacltle, was a power in the Union line. Several times he broke through t<J toss enemy ball carriers -for size- able losses. Frank Gatchell, :Bill Potts, and Joe Milano also did yeoman defensive work. * * Jack Sloatman played a bang up game at end, taking the place of Van Waldron who was discharged from the squad Friday for lack of c:o-operaUon and insubordination. * * \' This man Stanley should be a story book character. Besides col- lecting touchdowns, he collects A's and B's in his classes, and als·o works four and a half hom's a day to earn his keep. He is the second l>aseman on the baseball team. * * .. The real star of the Williatns team is not Stanley, but Pete Sal- sich. Salsich is the heavy duty blocker who clears the way for most of Stanley's long dashes. He also does the signal calling, pass- ing, and punting. * * Ernie Brown had a busy after- noon all around, between throw- inoo touchdoOwns, passes, calling signals, punting, and making half of the tackles.

The schedule this year is one of the most ambitious Union has at- tempted in many seasons. Colum- bia, C.C. N. Y., St. Lawrence, and Colgate are the big teams on the calendar for this win.ter, and from· a cursory outlook, things should be pretty warm during the cold months. Vermont will open the Garnet season at home on December 13, and the following .day, Rochester will be encountered: St. Lawrence will be the next offering, and then Columbia at New York city.

The game was decidedly in Union's favor the first half, and favored with the breaks, thirteen points were rung up. Bill Thomas scooted over for the two Union touchdowns, and took a pass from Terhune to add one extra point. The second half was a different story, for Williams seemed lo be charged with some sort of fiery spirit, and as a result, pushed over four touchdowns and two extra points to double the Garnet's ef- forts. Headed by Captain Durrell, already slated for a vat'sity post next year, the Purple utilized their advantage of weight and surged up and down the field, accomplish- ing their scores chiefly by line bucks.

However, the Union trio of North, Bastedo, and Hawkes finished up strong to take the next three places respectively· with but a three second interval between the second and fourth places. North's Best Run Bob North ran the best race of, his career to lead the Garnet con- tingent at the finish for the first time in 21..52. Neuman and Myei\s also ran well to secure seventh and ninth places respectively, which gave the Dutchmen the necessary first five places for vic- tory. This was the only victory for the Garnet out of the three con- tests held at Williamstown. The harriers have defeated Wesleyan and Williams, and lost to Vermont and R. P. I. The meet with the University of Rochester at home next Saturday will be the last chance for Coach Ketz' charges to show their stuff and gain a mar- gin in the victory column. Summary: Gregory, Williams ........... 21:32 Two perfectly executed \long- gainers\ gave Amherst its win over Massachusetts State. In both ca.ses, Elvin Wanzo, elusive colored halfback did the carrying. Late in the first quarter, he broke tluoough z•ight tackle on a rever~e and raced fifty-four yards to a touch- down. In the second half, the Sabrinas took to the air for their second score. Pattengill passed thirty-five yards to Coey who lateraled to Wanzo, and again the col<Hed flash went t(} town. The victory gave the Jeffmen the champion- : ship of the town of Amherst. Unable to gain consistently over-land, Hamilton llsed two long forward passes to set up its win- ning touchdown against Swarth- more Saturday. The Continental's splendid quarterback, Bob Mas- soth; threw both the aerials, and then slammed off right tackle from a spread formation to score. He also drop-kicked the extra p(}int. Vermont pushed a wealt Nor- wich team all over the field, but was able to tra:J).slate o-nly one touchdown from its gains. That scoz•e, which was creditE)d to half- ba<!k O'Neill, was sufficient for 1 victory as Norwich's impotent of- fense was totally unable to move against the trenchant defense of the Green Mountaineers.

The prompt pick-up and de- li very service provided for laun- dry, both outbound and inbound, together with the extremely rea- sonable rates, have been responsi- ble for the popularity of the idea. Laundry is now second only in im- portance to baggage, in the busi- ness which Railway Express re- ceives from colleges and schools,\ declared the local agent. -------0------- Outing Club at Vassar <Continued from Pa:ge 1) later the Umon delegation started home, arriving back at college shortly after six o'clock. During the course of the week-end the group climbed Mt Wittenburg, which, with Slide Mountain consti- tute two of the highest peaks in the Catskills. Wittenburg is about 3,500 feet in height, and has no timber line, which makes a good view impossible. Lunch, which con- sisted of cheese sandwiches, was eaten on the top of the mountain. E:veryone voted the outing a com- plete success, and plans a!'e under way to have anothel' joint outing in the near futu!'e.

To insure continuous ful- fillment they should insist that a proper proportion of time should be devoted to the increase of knowledge. and cultivation among the Amel'ican people. Only under this guaranty will the people, ul- timately, permit the use of the air for private profit.

The in· ll a mum! program has expanded and under the new :oystem nine- teen different eon tests will be of· feted to the ::;tudent body. Dur- mg each of the nine months of the :ochool year, sports in various !Iclds Wlll be open to the fl·atet- nity and group teams. 1 he Athletic De pat tment intends to make a new annual award. The award, which is to be called the ··mtramural Fat-ticipation Trophy ·, wul be made to any ore,amzeo g1uup on the can1pus who sc01es the mghest number or pmnts on a year 1 ound basis. In order tor a team to keep up in the fate in the competiuon 1t will be v.tally necessa1y that each group taKe pan in as many of the activities as they possibly can. Wrestling and Boxing Nothing as extensive as the pres- ent plan has ever been attempted by Union; and as far as we know, lew :;mall collcgf:s have ever enter· ed upon so gigantic a scheme for in- tramural competitions. Included in the new arrangement will be the revival of wrestling and boxing. Bill Ketz will probably take caz e of the !ormer sport while it is pos- stble that Ed .!!'itz will be placed in charge of the boxing. A swim- ming meet will once more fino swimmers or various degrees 01 pzoticiency paddling their way about in .l!'oote Pool. Baseball ana lootball field meets will malte their appearance and snowshoeing ana sruing will !ind their respective places on the newly arrangea \chedule. The activities have been divided into two groups, a tournament group and meets. In the former, three divisions occur, namely, ma- jor sports, minor spOI ts, and inter- mediate sports. The same arrange- ment occurs in the grouping of the meets. Under the major sports there is touch Joo!Jball, ·basketball and softball; under the interme- diate group, fall tennis, spring ten- nis, and wrestljng; an<;l under the minor group, horseshoes, basket- ball twenty-one, and boxing. Under meets, in the same order of division, the;re will be fall out- door track, swimming and spring outdoor track. In the second divi\ sion, winter ielays, a baseball and Football field meet appear. Under this grouping is listed Sig- ma Delta Psi, ;:tn all-round athletic fraternity which Coach Ketz hopes to start at Union. In the final group are listed foul shooting, ski· ing, and snowshoeing. Fencing is also listed, but due to the ad- vanced degr.ee of skjll needed in this sport, there will be no partici- pation award. Point System Worked entirely on a point basis, the group with the highest number of points at the end of the year will be declared the winner, re- ceiving the trophy. In the major sports, a team entered in the corn- petition will receive a stated num- ber of entrance points. In order to keep these points the team may not forfeit more than a single game. For. each additional game that is won, additional points in a systemitized order will be awarded to the winning team. The general idea of garnering points will cany through into the other activities.

Sherman Hirst, '37, was elected secretary of the society to fill the vacancy left by .Donald Hawkes, '36. · Moving pictures of last year's track team in action were viewed with interest and a novelty film by Grantland Rice showing the proper technique for individual events in the \gay nineties of the track\ brought forth a considerable ova- tion. A spirited discussion regarding the advisability of attempting to revive a board track meet this winter. resulted in the appoint- ment of Ed Bastedo, '36, John Ross, '36, and Sherman Hirst, 37, a:s a committee to investigate the possibil!ties. It was pointed out that in the past the college had spon- sored board tra~k meets that were lmown all over the state. the last one being held in the winter of 1931. The committee plans to inves- tigate means of cutting down the costs which made the winter meet~ prohibitive in the past few years. ----u---- Rochester Students Will Hear Broadcast of Game -·-- -------------------- Derrick and Four .lien Lift Idol to Pedestal The combined efforts of a lift- . !ng derrick, three laborers, and a contractor were necessary to raise the prostrated Idol to its usual resting place Wednesday afternoon. The venerable symbol of the Union tradition had lain on the turf for nearly a week, the victim of Hal- lowe'en pranksters. After setting up the derrick and ~astening it securely by ropes to iive nearby trees, the crew of men successfully lowered the Idol to its position on the pedestal an hour after they had begun preparation for the hoisting, so great was the care used in performing the job successfully. The famous landmark, originally brought from China, and the object of many an interclass paint fight, n·ow weighs nearly a ton, the workmen estimated. Although all precautions were made to save the Idol from any damage during lifting, a few chunks of stone, later cemented on again, were broken off and the paint around its neck suffered a deep cut from the lifting cable. After the job was completed, the contractor, who didn't know he was overheard, expre>\sed a typical alumnus' sentiment when he stated with a twinkle in his eye, \Well I wouldn't give much for her just as a beauty, but as the Idol I think she's the real stuff.\ ----·0--- Stanl~y, Rotundo Attend Philosophy Club Meeting Professor Philip E.

Campus Entertains Numerous Visitors Ten Fraternities Announce Guest Lists for Formal Dances This Weekend The campus will celebrate the final home game of the 1935 season with ten fraternity dances attended by feminine guest.s, alumni, and members of the faculty. In addi· tion to the regular open dances held by most of the houses, Sigma Phi and Alpha Delta Phi are plan- ning a joint affair, and Delta Upsi· Ion is entertaining friends of the chapter at a buffet supper after the game. Beta Theta Pi will dance from 9 until 12 to the music of the Gar- net Gob~ins. The guest list is as follows: Miriam Scofield, Glovers- ville; Jean Doremus, Schenectady; Emily Naylor, Port Jervis; Eliza. beth Ehew, Gloversville; Eetty Paige, Schenectady; Marie Close, Mayfield; Jane Gillespie, Bingham- ton.; Ruth W. Wilson, Kingston; Rosemary Jackson, Lynbroolt, L.

The story could not be .:luoppr·e»:oed, however, and within a comparatively :ohort while the conditions existing in the :otock- yards and the slaughter houses was a popular source of reading for the American public. Mr. Sinclair speaks tonight on a subject far-removed from Chicago and the stockyards. At 8 o'clock he will begin his lecture on the program ·he had outlined fm· Cali- fornia last year. The meeting will be open to the public for an admis- sion charge. Tickets will be sold at the daor. In the 30 years or .more that he has been in the public eye, as an author and candidate for political offices, Mr. Sinclair has been sounding the rallying call of the socialist party. He has been bit- terly attacked by the vested inter-' ests of many cities and industries for his own vituperous assaults upon what has always been acce·pt- ed without question. His own experiences with the forces of the press are summarily related in \The Brass Check\ in which he declares that journalism, for the main part, has been prosti- tuted. His difficulties with news- paper editors in getting them to print the results of his muck-rak- ing led him to wi·ite of thal part of his life. Mr. Sinclair has more recently been regarded as one of the out- standing candidates for governor of California. He has continued the offensive bilt not with the same fiery damnation of the powers that be. He was socialist candidate for Congress in 1920, for the senate in 1922 and for governor in 1926 and 1934. Painters Of William James Portrait Example Of 'Partnership In Art' Tlw varsity game between Roch· ester and Union will start tomor- mw at 2 o'clock, after the fresh- man team ha>l completed it» seaoun, playing against the Raymond Rior- dan School from Height.:ltown, N.Y. The race:o between the fre:ohman ·eros:o-country team and Troy High School and between the varsity harriers and the Yellowjackets will take place before and during the var:oity football game. Rochester Indomitable Rochester, known to the Garnet for its indomitable spirit, has ever been a di.;turbing factor in any athletic game. No matter how nwny puinb a Garnet tean1 may 1-tave in advantage over a Yellow- jacket squad, there always remains the po:osibility that the Rochester team will turn defeat into victory. Since 1889 Union and Rochester have maintained this rivalry, with the latter institution having the better of it. Of the 31 games played in the 46 year old series Union has won 13 and Rochester 14, with three games ending in ties. Under Coach Hatfield Union defeated Rochester in three out of four games. The results exemplify the equal- ity of both colleges on the football field over a number of years. And this season also the records of the Yellowjackets and the Dutchmen continues on its equal pace. Union in six games has lost [our, won one, and tied one, while Rochester has lost four and won one in five games played. It is from such weighty evidence that the football coaches prophecy another really tough bat- tle tomorrow afternoon. Seniors in Last Home Game Starting for Union will be the same group of men who opposed and performed so well against Wil- liams. All are expected to play in their same positions.

S. \BARBARIAN.\ * • To the Editor: . If I'm not mistaken, a library IS a place where a person may gc fo~ .reference or other work per- tammg to reading, and concentrate The two main functions of a u. brary are to provide books and a quiet place to read. The Union C::oll ege library fails to satisf~ ert~~r of these most essential 1 e- qlllsrtes. 'fhere is little use to argue that the b.ooks placed on the shelves of our hbrary are inadequate we all know that. But there is absolutely no excuse for this irnp01 tant de- P!lrtlhent of the college not to pro~ VIde quiet. 1 defy anyone to con- centrate while typewritel!S are pounding, phone bells are ringing, and fellow students are discussing the outcome of football games, etc., ln voices that echo throughout the building. Can't something be done about silencing .those who choose to make the library their headquarters for world-wide debates? There must be restrictions-why aren't they en- forced? Every- other library in which I've had the pleasure of reading are quite silent. A member of the. staff politely asks perso;ns to leave if they continue talking or otherwise disturbing. those who are there for a purpose. May I suggest that our librarians adopt a policy similar to this one, and see to it that the li- brary is kept as quiet a:s possible? ROBERT T. SHREVE. •· . .

In the second encounter and tirst home meet, the Dutchmen came cmt ahead of a much talk.ed of We;;- leyan outfit, with a perfect 15-1(, ~~ore. h. 1:-'. I. came to Union the IDllowing week and displayed a butst ot speed that caught the Gar- net silksters flattooteu and went home with a one-point victo1·y, the !mal sco1e being 28 to 27. L:oach Ketz's men came back last week on the grass laid Williams course to score their second win with a !ina! compilation of 25 to 30. Nmth ran the best race of hi:; career on this course, probably owing to the fact that he likes to run on grass. At ·any rate he led his teammates Ea Hastedo and Bill Hawkes to the tape in good time for the fot eign course. ---o~--- N ew Intramural Program \ViU Have Broad ~cope tContinued from Page 1) tennis, for in;;tance, in order to score entrance points, a group must enter and compete at least two men. Additional points will be added on the following ba.sis: The n~mber of vic toties necessary to wm the tournament is divided into 65 and the quotient is the number of points awat ded per game won. If a group has more tl:an two men entet ed, each man will score J-oint:; equal to his victot'ie:;, times the above quotient. A bye shall be counted as a victory. Horseshoes, and basketball twenty-one will be conducted on much the same ba:;i:; as the tenni;;, The entrance point;; will vary ac- cording to the importance and number of men needed in the sport. It follow><, then, that tht: major spot ts will receive the great- est number of entrance points. ·1hus, fifty points will be a\'arded in touch tootball, :;o! tball and bas- ltetball. The winner receives 100 ex.tra points with the tunnels up receiving points in descending or- der. Cups Still Awardrd . Despite the fact that one cup wtll be awarded to the winner hav- ing the greatest number of group ~omts at the end of the year, addi- ttonal cup;; will still be awarded in those activitie;; which have re- ceived recognition in the past. All of the major spot ts will be ;;o con- ducted. Horseshoes, Spring and Fall Track, and swimming will also have a cup award. The intt am ural conte:;ts which have already been played this fal1 will be C(}unted in the final statis- ~ics. Becau~e none of the coinpet- mg groups were aware of the new policy, the judges have been lib- eral in awarding points to the com- petitors. The standing of the teams follows: Sigma Chi. 310.8; Sigma. Phi, 252.6; Cht Psi, 247; North Col- lege, 239, Beta Theta Pi. 235; Phi Gamma Delta, 224; Neutlals, 218; Alpha Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon Phi Sigma Delta, Delta Upsilon. 'T'l:is is not a complete li;;t.

It is hoped that under this new system of conducting the intra- mural activities, that a greater number of men will turn out for the various events and at the l3ame time a greater interest and en- thusiasm will be stirred up among the competing factions. One of the basic ideas in orde1' to fulfill this hope is the fact that entrance points will be given, provided the group continues in its scheduled games with an allowance of one torteit in the major !ip()rts.

It is a monument to the engineering perfection of 25 years ago, and was placed there as the result of a bet with Samuel In- sull. Its story begins back in 1903 when General Electric's engineer- ing vice-president, E. W. Rice, Jr., was asked if his company would build a 5000-kilowatt turbine-gener- ator. A power machine of this size had never been built before, and with one exception, no foreman ih the plant cared to undertalte its construction with the care and speed deman.dPd.

It is Monday morning-, and the third period class is almost ovel', when the sound of a distant explosion awakens the sleepy students and distracts the attentive ones. Boom! The professor pauses, and looks at his watch. \Oh of course. It\s Armistice Day,\ he says, and resumes his lecture. Boom! The sound of the bombs is far away, but they have a feeling of nearness. The air thickens at each pulsation. Boom! The class seems to be listening to the pr<Jfessor, but they are restless. Several are keeping count on their fingers. Boom! There is something ironic in firing bombs to celebrate the beginning of peace--ironic and ominous. Boom! Seventeen years since the war ended. The nations are strain- ing at the leash again, and the world's ar- senals are stacked with fresh bombs \row on row.\ Boom! The prophets say that it is only a matter of time till these bombs will be used in earnest. Boom! A new generation, with no memories of the old war, will be called on to fight the new one. Eoom! Each bomb fired on Armistice Day celebrates a million men killed, over two million wounded or crippled. Boom! Each bomb stands for thirty billion dollru:s squandered for destru~­ tion. Boom! The bombs have ceased, but fo1· some time after, their ominous sound beats like a drum in the mind. SPORTS FOR ACTIVITY Writing to the New York Times, Mac- CraC!ken says, \The dilemma of the college administrator today is that whenever he en- deavors to defend his college from use as a recruiting ground for political .exploitation he is charged with tyranny and suppression of free speech; but whenever he defends the right of the students on their campus to free speech and assembly, and to listen to whom they will, he is charged with innumerable cdmes, the least of which is disloyalty to the Constitution. \ •.. It remains true that active participa- tion in the political arena has usually meant an end to scholarly career. The function of st1.1dents is to study, and whenever political participation replaces study the university disintegrates .••. \ •.. Our platform may be summed up in tluee words: let students study.\ JOIN THE RED CROSS The annual Red Cross role call has begun. Before the campaign is over, millions of peo- ple of all ages, from old men to school chil- dt-en will have responded with their contribu- tions to the greatest organized charity in the world. Everyone knows of the spectacular work done by the Red Cross in time of disaster: floods, fires, and earthquakes. What is not so widely known is the tremendous amount of routine work: relief, nursing service, pub- lic h.ealth education, and first aid training wbieh form the staple stock in trade of the :Red· Cross, and which absorb the greater por- . tion of their funds and facilities.

Those who favor preservation of our Liberty, our Freedom and our Constitution can focus attention upon this by the following: * • • A HUNDRED YEARS YOUNG! A Song of Liberty and Freedom 'l'lut Never Grows Old The Colonists gave up their homes in Europe to obtain liberty and freedom in America. After 150 years here they learned to fear gov- ernment because they experienced royal despotism. They rebelled against it. They joined with their neighbors in a Declaration of Inde- pendence in which they stated that: \All men ... are endowed by their Creator with certain un- alienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, govern- ments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the govern- ed .... That whenever any form of government becomes destruc- tive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter ... it. \When a long train of abuses and usurpations,\ continues the Declaration of Independence, \pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to re- duce them under absolute des- potism, it is their right, it Is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future secur- ity .. ·\ Freedom and liberty was in the blood of our forefathers. Freedom and liberty is the theme of and ap- pears six: times in the song \Amer- ica\ written in 1832: The word, freedom, appears three times; the word liberty twice; and the word free, once, in it's four stanzas. In this spirit of freedom and lib- erty, \we the people,\ In our Con- stitution established the United States as the first government in history in which the people are master and the government is ser- vant. In our Constitution, we enum- erate the powers which we bestow upon the government, We make it a limited government. We define its a~thority. We distribute its powers among three branches of govern- ment. We incorporate a \Bill of Rights\ and we declare that all powers not granted to the govern- ment by our Constitution are re- served to· the states or the people. Thus the song \America\ reflects the spirit of freedom and liberty in the blood of all Americans as stated in the Declaration of Independence and as subsequently put into our Charter of Liberty-The United States Constitution. -Sons of the American Revolution Armistice Day press release. of a mouse and a head of a waiter. is executing many commissions for A correspondent tells us that some- ballets, music scores for motion pie- one saw snakes too. tures, a symphony, and an opera- * * * all issued by the u.

I understand that at ]Past one of the women in charge of the dask agrees that something should be done to muzzle those who make the library a place for group discussion. Another of them says, \It can't be done it's been this way for years, and 'with the facilities that we have we are doing our best.\ Perhaps nothing can be done to lessen the noise of t:rpewriters but it is certainly pos- srble to keep the students quiet. There are few people in this world who can concentrate on something they are reading, or the notes they may be preparing, with loud talk- ing going on all around one. . Gran ted, our library facilities are limited, and the visions of a new one to take its place are pretty far distan_t. Since the new system of four mstea<I of five subjects for upper clas'Smen went into effect the amount of outside reading iU: the library has increased tremen- ~ously. No one can deny this! Dur- mg the day the library is crowded almost to capacity. Why, then, should not something be done to make things quiet? Perhaps a few signs placed about t.o the effect that this is really a libra:ry and one is expected to be as quiet as poss.ible, would be help- ful. The staff 1s large enough to see that those who are creating a disturbance be asked to leave regardless of who they are or what they may be \studying\ for.

The composite effect of abruptly ·ending passages, thunder from the brasses, and pallid instru- mentation is terrifying, one which teems with frustration. The symphony may be said to de- pict the frustration of a yearning spirit when crushed by overbearing economic forces. It is a reflection, or rather a representation, of the stifling forces which are alleged to exist without the bounds of the Soviet Union. Shostakovitsch has written a forceful work in this first symphony. Notwithstanding its might, it is wonderfully lyrical, and a perfect specimen of strict sym- phonic form. In time it should take its place beside the symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, and Bruckner, each of which was a masterpiece of propaganda in its own right. 0<--- NOTES ON OUR CONTEMPORARIES Return to Prosperity!

BEDELL , Battle Expected In Little Three Clash In keeping with the administra- tion's policy of broadening the geo- graphical distribution of the stu.- dent population a.t Union, Trinity College will appear on the 1938- 39 football scl:t~dule in plMe of Hobart. The fil'st game will b~ played at Hartf~ll'd and in the fol- lowing year the Connecticut team will send theh· representatives to· thil Garnet g.ridiron. Because of changes that have been made in tltil schedule recently, six state,; will be rep:resented in the eight games played in 1938-39. Besides ou.r home state there will be team:. from Maine, Connecticut, Penn- sylvania, Vermont and Massaehu· setts. A definite date. has been fixed for the sophom.ore-freshman foot-. ball battle. The game will be played on the Saturday following the Hamilton encounter. Charles Krull has already issued a call for fresh- man practice and the boys will be out learning some of the whys and wherefores tomorrow after- noon. The clash between the two classes promises to be a good one with the first year men already predicting a win for themselves. Amherst~Williams Ready Fo;r Small College Fight This Week Amherst and Williams tuned up for their annual battle at Williams- town this week by running wild against Swarthmore and Wesleyan Saturday. The Lord Jeffs ran up a 40-6 count over Swarthmore while the Purple continued to exhibit their high scoring proclivities a:t the expense of the Ca:rdinals, score 41-0. Other games on the small col- lege circuit showed Buffalo surpris- ing Hobart with a 13-12 win, and Haverford showing the way to Hamilton in a wild touchdown pa- rade, 27 -2(). The Amherst and Williams re- sults gave further rise to the al- ready deepseated impression that their clash next Saturday will be one of the greatest in theh· long rivalry. Inasmuch as both have de- feated Wesleyan, the g~e will de- cide the Little Three champion. Subs Prominent Against Swarthmore, Amherst used reserves almost entirely. The shock troops that Lloyd Jordan un- blanketed at the start pushed over a score immediately.

The Green Shirts displayed a fine brand of running .power and early in the f·irst quarter made a serious threat on the Garnet goal line, but when no ground was made in thr'ee plays, Nania drop- ped back to Union's ten-yard line and successfully completed a field goaL Likewise in the final period, with the ball on Union's three-yard stripe the Riordon heavier line failed to open any holes and Nania again booted the ball through the uprights for three more points. Coach Nitchman's charges, how- ever, had their moments and dis- played a snappy brand of ball while outplaying their Highland opponents. With Jess than three minutes to play, an accurate pass by Bob Terhune at midfield came to r•est in the arms of Ray Lewis in the left corner of the field on the ten-yard line, and he scooted across the line for the first touch- down of the day. Pass Wins Here BH!y Thomas showed his ability as a quarterback and called for a fake placement which turned out to be a Terhune to Thomas pass over the last blurred line for the winning point of the game. During the entire game, Riordan was haunted by Terhune's right arm, considerable ground being gained by the frosh air attack. But when Nania, the Green quarter- back, tried the same tactics, Thomas, displaying his usual col- orful defense, intercepted three passes and ran them back for an average of twenty-five yards. Ter- hune also snagged one of the many Riordon passes and galloped for thirty yards. * * Football Field Meet To Be Held 011.

PlMement Fails The cross-state men, however, again got under way, and maneu- vered to the Union goal, where they were repulsed by a decidedly resist- ant Garnet line seven times, finally having to resort to a quick pass for the score. The ensuing place kick was blocked by 3J bevy of Union linesmen headed by Bill Potts and Jack Sloatrnan, and that was the end of the scoring for the afternoon. The battle was one of the keen- e<:~t ever played on Alexander Field nnd it furnished the dance week- end crowd with plenty of thrills throughout. Credit must be allotted to the Rochester stalwarts for their stand in the first qua:rter and their remarkable comebacli: to score in the final period, but equally as much must also be ·said for the charge and fire of tlle Union line all afternoon and the viciousness evinced in. the driving of the back- field. Truly it wiH be remembered as one of the nip-and-tuck games of the season. • • Hamilton, Union's next rival, was a victor over Rochester a few weeks ago to the tune of 13 to 0 On this basis of judging, Union and Hamilton should be farily evenly matched, although the Garnet's showing Saturday brings her rat- ing up a little higher. The spirit shown by the crowd was the best displayed this year Naturally-, most of it was due to the fine showing of the team, but may- hap some of it was for the benefit of the weel>:-end visitors. In the R. P. I. meet the an- nouncement was first successfully tried. The announcer reported on the runners at the mile marks, and the results were relayed through to the gymnasium. * * * The Rochester men in the stands had an interesting time between advertising the wearable and dur- able goods of some Rochester de- partment store and giving a play- by-play acc-ount of the football and cross-country games. Four men were required to wire the account, one to give the instantial progress, one to summarize, one to advertise, and one to kibitz. The cost Gf the service to the Rochester students listening in at their commons on the campus amounted to about $90. The men's furnishing store in Rochester boosted half the cost.

MILLER Clr ntun will be the scene tornor- ww of what promise:; to be one of the most colorful ::;mall-college games of the season, when Union meets Hamilton in the 43rd en- coun te1· of a series which dates back lo 1890. Although it will be the concluding game of the year fo1· each team, it is the one game which each team considers rnost important, and whoever triumphs will consider its season as success- ful, regardless of other defeats. In outlining the qualifications for t:Q.e city rnauage1· 1orm of adminis- tration, which Schenectady will put into effect January 1, 1936, Mr. Baker stated that the person elect- ed a:s manager is in practically every case someone experienced in \this business of government.\ Preparing for a more ambitious Idol Publication program for the coming season Promt·sed Mond·ay the Mountebanks Theatre today launched an intensive campaign Sr. E xpl or a do r N01·te Viene Como U n Mexicano Youth of Vienna Face Hard Future On the Union side, eleven men will be playing their last games for Alma Mater, and while not all of them are regulars, all will probably see action tomorrow.

Hamilton will lose hut four of ·its regulars, Ike Le Fevre, half- back, and Captain Harry Goss, Jack Carmer and Grier Hand, line- men. Rain Stops Practice rnclement weather for the past week bas slowed up practicing ac- li vi ties of both teams, but at the same tilne it has afforded injured men a:n opportunity to recover and as a result, each team will be prac- tically at full strength. In fact, the only man incapable of seeing action tomorrow will probably be Hamii- Council to Choose Manager It remains for the members of the recently elected city council to make their selection of a city man- ager within the next month. The manager will be .chosen when the council meets .for its first official meeting on January- 1, 1986. Mr. Baker declared that \the manager of the modern city is the employee and chief advisor of the council. The council is the policy determining ·body, but it is the task of the manager to ascertain the facts and to report them to the council for its guidance and judg- ment. Once the council has deter- mined upon the policy it is the duty of the city manager to carry out that poUcy.'' The head: of the present Roches- ter administration, a graduate of Union College and a widely-known civil engineer, attempted to allay the ever-present fear that the man- ~ger form would not eliminate po- litical control, patronage and all of the other attributes of the old form of government. Politics Eliminated He said that the answer is \of course, that political considerations still exist in every business in every <lity of the country, but the differ- ence, .however, is apparent in that the manager or chief executive un- der this form of government is us- ually chosen ·because of his record and his qualifications for the job.

Enzer, Graduate Manager of the Mounte- banks, attempts are being made to increase the number of road per- formances this year . .Already let- ters have been sent out to other colleges, secondary schools, and private organizations asking for bookings. Up to the present no re- plies have been received, however. The illustrated leaflets used in the subscription campaign are being sent out to interest prospective sponsors in the Mountebankfi. and so secure more extended road tours this season. Students with infor- mation which might lead to an out- side booking are asked to com- municate with Mr. Enzer. With stories, articles, editorials, poems, and reviews written by fourteen students, the first number of this year's Idol, Union College literary magazine, will be ready for distribution Monday, it was an- nounced today by Robert S. Lan- ger, editor-in-chief. · Instead of the conventiona:l book reviews which have been pub- lished in past issues, the November Idol will contain several capsule reviews written in verse. A series of reflections on collegiate affec- tions, written by Ferdinand Helm in the advanced composition class, is also included in this issue. Edi- torials, of which there are two, were written by Robert S. Langer and John C. Davis. The cover of this month's maga- zine will be blue, a change from usual garnet and white cover of former issues. Replacing the table of contents which has been printed on the cover of each number thus far, will be the list of contributors. The students contributing mate- rial printed in the November is- sue are: Robert S. Langer, Van Trumbull, Duarte Fea:therston- haugh, Donald Trumbull, John L. Hallenbeck, Carl Olsen, and Cle- ment Finch, of the class of 1986; S. Ralph Cohen, Ferdinand Helm, John C. Davis, Charles Reeves, and Richard Tru!llbuli, of the class of 1937; aud Henry Seider and At- thur Wallace Hepner, of the class of 1938. The D. U.'s provided the best show since Barnum died when they bet Bob North tha:t he dared not attend his ten twenty class dressed como lDl Mexicano, from sandals to sombrero. With a week-end in sight, the stake looked so worth- while to Union's world traveller and explorer that he took them up and appeared this morning, decked out like Pancho Villa's little bro- ther. His blue and white poncho, which smells Indianish, and which he admits is second ha:nd, looked a bit out of place flapping in a Mohawk Valley breeze and didn't fit at all into tqe atmosphere of Mr. von Forstmeyer's German class. The sombrero, made somewhere in the mountains {)f Central Mex- ico, is two and a half feet in diam- eter and high enough to conceal a stowaway. When North reached his class he pulled two books and a theme tablet out of the crown. The D. U.'s tried to promote an added attraction by sponsoring a one-man parade down State Street during the noon hour, but North's Mexican bargain proved too stiff for the brothers' pocketbooks.

Dean H. HarLman Friday, November 15, 1935 A NEW CHALLENGE The completion of Hale IIou:;e may have a decided effect upon campus life and the place of fraternities in student affairs. So- cial activity in the past has been hu·gely confined to fraternities because no other cen- ters existed. Except for the library and the gymnasium basement, there was no place where students might gather to read or talk. Hale House will change this situation. Not only will there be a sanitary place for stu- dents to eat, but the hall will be furnished like a club and will provide a g·athering place where students may meet throughout the day to talk and smoke and l\ead. This center will be far more complete than the average frate1·nitr dining room and will have the same or better facilities for social life than most chapters. Such a hall as this may prove more at- tractive to many students than a fraternity which carries with it restrictions distastful to undergmduate \independents.\ Most ad- vantages offered by fraternities will be pro- vided for without the rules and class supe- riority which exist in every chapter. Does this mean that fraternities will lose their place on the campus? Perhaps. The answer to this question probably depends upon the fraternities themselves. If they ex- ist as mere eating houses with only a doubt- ful cloak of secrecy to disguise them, Hale House will rightfully supplant them. But the wiser ones will probably heed the warning and evaluate themselves. They will seek a new and more important place by developing with the rest of the campus and offering new advantages to students. These wiser fraternities will cease to be recreation and dining halls. They will assume a new intellectual and social level .They will MARK TWAIN'S WAR PRAYER The countt·y marks this week the hun- dn~dth birthday anniversmy of :\lark Twnin. Th~ product () f twith er arb tocracy nor peas- antQ·, he cc.unc from the lower middle clas~ which looms so large in American history. His fre:;hne:;s of ul:ltlouk, his interested flip· puncy, his enthusiasm and powerful sarcasm and irony made him beloved and feared. In commemeration of his centennial, The Concordiensis reprints one of Mark Twain's most ch~wacteristic utterances, published posthumously, which is especially appl·opri- ate at this time. \Lord our God, help us to tear their sol- diers to bloody shreds with ou1· shells; help us to cover thei1· smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriotic dead ; h.elp us to d1·own the thunder of the guns with the cries of the wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of the un- offending widews with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unbefriended thru wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunge1 aud thirst, spert of the sun-flames of sum- mer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the gt·ave and denied it-for om sakes, who adore Thee, Lord, blast theil hopes, blight th€ir lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way witll their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask of one who is the Spirit of love and 1vho i:; the eve1·-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset, and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Grant our prayet·, 0 Lord, and Thine shall be the praise and honor and Glory now and ever. Amen.\ SEIZING A PIECE OF TIME A group of Hussian write1·s, journalists, and photog1·~phen; under the direction of Maxim Gorki are collaborating on the unique project of ~ts::;cmbling in one book a complete and permanent l'ecord of a single day. Friday, September 27, 1!}35, was the day picked by this g1·oup on which to ol>se1·ve and record evet-y possible facet of human ac- tivity. Correspondents from all over the world have co11tributed data, notes, docu- ments, pictm·es, \all the everyday testimony of how peopl.e lived, how they dressed, what they ate, how they suffered, how they re- joiced on that day, chosen as an ordinary day in h urnan existence.\ One of the editors compares this monu- mental literary task to stealing up on the world, watching it stealthily, and catching it as if it were \a wild beast going along its customary path at night to drink.\ The project is impressive for its vel'y im- mensity. It seems impossible from the out- set to gather into one book all th.e minutiae of daily existence. But the most significant thing about the project is the fact that it has captured the imagination of so many :people, that it ap]Jal'ently answers a deep, uncon- scious demand in the modern mind to grasp the concept of time. It fits in perfectly with Spengler's theory that the western culture- civilization is acutely awa1·e of the flow of time and disturbed by realizing that a. mul- titude of events, actions, and people occur and exist simultaneously. Walt Whitman would have been intensely interested in such a work, and among con~ temporary WI'iters, Thomas Wolfe has best expressed tl1e feeling which w:e all ha.ve at least occasionally: a painful desire to know everythin~, to experience everything, to seize a fragl.'\ant of time and keep it foreve1·.

Fair Play in Sports, agitat- ing for removal of the 1936 Oly1npics from Germany or re- fu.sing to pa1·ticipate in them, rooently requested the opinions of C(Jllege editors on the sub- ject. A clipping of an editorial fr<JJU the Concordiensis of Oct. 15 was sent opposing such ac- tion. It provoked the following letter: To the Editor: Y (]Ur letter to us is a tribute to your fair-mindedness. You state ve1y frankly that you are opposed to the •movement of which we at·e an integral part, and yet you take the trouble to let us lmow where you stand and what your reasons were for taking that position. Thank you very much for your courtesy. I dC> believe that you have a mis- taken conceptiOn of the issues in- volved. You seem to thinlt that this is an argument between the Jew- ish 1ace and the German natwn. This is far from the truth and if anything m our literature gave you that impression there must be something misleading in it. It is not even a question of the Catho- lics against the German nation. Nor can the Protestants, who are also persecuted, be said to be the sole protagomsts in this modern tragedy. What is at stake is not only the future of the Olympic games, whrch will have been steered off its rightful course by the N\azi Ol:ympiad, but the very futUie of civilization itself. The way in which the Nazis have dis- torted' the ideal of fair play and the way in wh!Ch they have degrad- ed the commonly accepted ideals of elementary social justic are hor- rrfying indeed. Why, they even sneer at the very pr·emise of the Olympic games themselves, so how can we in the name of humanity allow them to capture this much cherished prize? Don't think for a moment that they are not straining every muscle to beat down the efforts of a hor- rified and determined American people. In tbe New York Times of Novenber 7th it was reported that Hitler promi~ed to remove all dis- crimination that is being p1·acticed against persecuted religious minori- ties and labor. If this does not mean that a systematic, if subtle, fonn of torture is being practiced daily, I should like to know what it does mean The very formulation of his promise indicates as much. Shall we honor the Nazis with our presence in the face of such undis- guised leers? Just look at these excerpts from B1·uno Malitz'\ book on \the Spirit of Sports in the Third Reich.\ Mr. Malit:z, incidentally, is a \race-com- rade\ of ours; he occupies the dis- tinguished position of Nazi sports leader. Quoting: \We Nazis see no value whatsoever in having negroes travel through Germany and meet- ing our finest in competition.\ Do we -want to subject our sprinters, who are to a very large extent colored, to such pressure? It seems to rne that one shouldn't worry ab<>ut the effect that such a cam- paign may have upon already exist- ing national animosity. As a mat- ter of fact, to take you up the Olympic games should not be held because they do not help, as you say, m ternational friendlmess. Bruno Malitz says very frankly that not only do the Olympics not ameliorate international friction but they are a complete waste of mon-ey from the investor's stand- paint. He puts it that boldly. Here's a typrcal sentence: \Sport is sup- posed to be the uniting link be- tween nations ..... and still all the o;uccess of our victorious sports- men th1oughout the world were un- able to cancel the shameful para- glaphs of Versailles regarding the war guilt. Nor were our trrbute payments reduced in the least.\ In- cidentally, besides sneermg at the concepts of international amity which is at the back of the holdmg of these Olympic games, \race-com- rade\' Malitz gives pamful proof of the fact that, for the Nazis, the Oly1npics are nothing, if not a play- thmg of the politicians. And yet they have the temerity to accuse us of injecting pohtics into sports! In your editorial you argue that to agitate for the removal of the Olympics fl'Om Germany would be to plar Into the hands of the Ger- mans. C You seem to think that the Germans as a nation are identi- fiable with Hitler and his clique). Shall we allow them to go their brutal way unhampered just be- cause they threaten us with \get- ting mad\ at us? You ask us to desist from our attempts to remove the site of the Olympics for the reason that such attempts are ironic comments on \the low sta- tus of the Olympics of today when compared with the original Greek games.\ If there is something ugly in the Olympics let us not gild It over with our participation. It seems to me that this would be an unforgivable sin. When surgeons try to cure a disease they don't graft healthy skin upon a cancer- ous growth. Let us remove the source of the affliction and then we will have a traditional Olym- pics. Sincerely yours, WILLIAM B. CHA.MBERLAlN, Executive Secretary, Committee on Fair Play in Sporn. Russell Sag:e Play Shows War Horrors Russell Sage Play:ers t() Repeat Shirland Qui11n's VVal' D1·ama \Dragon's Teetl1,\ '])()night The horrors of vvu· are vividly portrayed in Shirland Quinn's dra- ma, \Dragon's Teeth,\ presented last Saturday night by the Box and Candle Players of Russell Sage College, and repeated t<>night. Crit- icism of the first perfot'mance was decidedly favorable. The play opens as Darrel!t Mar- ston attracts the attentbn of the Army offiCials with h1s invention of the Marston Di!echen Control. However his lady love, Lydia, who IS intensely opposed to war and everything connected with it, threatens to leave him If he pre- sents the plans of the device to the government Lydia's attitude finally bewilders Marston completely, so that he de- stroys the only existing plans of the Ma1ston Direct ion Control. His action embitters his father, Colonel Marston, who has become hardened to war and a1·my life through years of expm ience. It is in the third act that the Russell Sage production reaches the peak of its appeal. The young mventor falls asleep and dreams of the economrc and social conditions preceding war. Then he sees the combat begun, the intense p1 ofi- teering at home, and at last the battle-scarr·ed wa1·riors, ret Ul ning to the despairing conditions In their own country to the tune of the vic- tory march. R. P. I. CQ-()PErates Students of Russell Sage fill the female roles in this play, while stu- dents from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and residents of Troy take the male parts.

Beckett Describes Baker Describes Life at St Andrews Manager's Dnties Average Student Week At St. Andrews Depicted In Chapel Speech That St. Andrews University in Scotland is not so different fl'om American schools was b1.1ought out when Clark Beckett, exchange stu- dent from that College to Union, addressed the student body Wed- nesday, for the second time this year·. Outlining the average week of a St. AndFews' student, Beckett said that the class rs run with some- what more ceremony than here, the professors appearing in aca- demic gown only after all the class Is seated. There are no recltatic:ms, but all lectures, and copious notes are consequently taken. \The unbroken scarlet line of the students dressed in their red gowns, against the blue of the sea\ was described as one would see it from a promintory near the college when the Sunday morning walks are being taken on a long pier which extends into the sea. Numerous Societies There are so many societies that everyone usually belongs to three or four. \The only thing wrong,\ accordmg to Beckett, \is that there aren't enough threatres in tile town.\ Other means of enteitam- ment seems to be present, however, for every evening a large gr-oup from the college assemble 1n a \cafe attached to the theatre\ tas it is tran~lated from the Scotch). Wednesday afternoon is a recess, and an impromptu dance is held every Saturday mght. One of the greatest attractions of Sunday cha- pel, according to Beckett, is the fact that the men and the -women students are seated directly oppo- Site and facmg each other. A word of advice was rolled out in the at- tl'actrve burr of the speaker: \Live a fool life,\ which he was pron1pt to spell \Full.\ (Continued from Page One) proved conditions in the city which he administers, and if he is a wise manager, he will not let p'Dlitlcs in- terfere with what he knows to be the best lnte~·est of the city govern- ment. \If the political pa1·ty in control is wrse rt will not expect a mana- ger to subordinate the •best interest of the city to political expediency. To do otherwise m:vites disaster for the administration and defeat at the polls for the political party. R~­ member that the city manager IS expected to be removed from poli- tics.\ A brief picture of the tdevelop- ment of the city mana:ger govern- ment was verbally painted by M~. Baker who stated that approxi- mately 460 cities in the United States are administered by so-called managers instead: of by elected, un- trained officials. The \so-called council-manager form of govern- ment in the State of New York has been recognized by the state legis- lature, which in the year 1914 passed an act giving to cities of the second and third classes in the state the option of choosing one of seven plans of city government.\ When Schenectady officially names its first city manager in January, eight New York state cit- ies will be functioning under coun- cil-manager charters. Improvements Explained As for the results of installing tlained executives in large cities in this country, Mr. Baker thinks \almost without exception that the following steps have been taken in the average city operating under the council-manager fovm of gov- ernment: fir·st, the equalization of assessments, •based upon a compre- hensive study of values and on a city map prepared to show all of the parcels of assessable pr·operty within the city limits; \Second the establishment of a purchasing system for purchasing dty supplies in quantity and at a considlerable discount, usually They do say they're milder and taste and I've heard tell they satisfy through contract to the lowest re· sponsible .bidder; \Thil•d the classification of posi- tions and the standardization of salaries of city employees; \Fourth the strengthening of the city's financial stru<lture through careful supervision of :financial transactions and through adellu:;tte budgetary control; \Fifth the Improvement of the services of:fered to the public.\ Gives Warning There was a note of warning also in Mr. Balter's speech wherein he said: \rn this movement to secure for our <litjes an Improved form of municipal administration, the en- thusiasm of the proponents of the new forl!L of government often leads them to make claims and promises whi•ch cannot be fulfilled: by any ad!rninistration. It is only natural that such daims and prom- ises shouldi be m.ade, but experience has demonstrated that their fulfill- ment is partial, at best. \The structure of municipal gov- ernment of all forms in the State of New Y<o1·k is governed to a large , extent by state law, limiting our municipa!lities In their sphere of ac-~ tion, and it Is only within this leg· ally presc1·ioed sphere that im- provement is possible, No change m governnental form In itself will bring greatly improved municipal admmlsti·ation. ---0•--- Mountebanks Want Men For Backstage Work A call for men interested In scene design and painting was issued to- day by Ed-ward L.

Carroll has indicated that the work of the cast has beeu centered during the past week in rehearsing the play as a whole. Rehearsals have been going on since the beginning of Septem- ber. Since 1933 the play written by Anderson attacking the corrupt American system of government has been accepted as one of the landmarks in native dramaturgy. At the time of the satire's presen- tation on Broadway, John M:ason Brown and Heywood Broun, noted columnists, concurred in the opin- ion that it was the most effect! ve propaganda play which had come along In ·several seasons. During the past summer Fred€r- ick H. Koch, director of the North Carolina Playmakers at Chapel Hill, speaking at one of the Mo- hawk Drama Festiva;I lectures, gave a concise interpretatia.n of the development of Maxwell Anderson as a native playwright and dra:ma- tf.st. He stated that once Anderson had achieved the art of writing about the things he knew about, he there- by attained the dramatic maturity necessary for successful writing. White Desert,\ the first of Andel'· on's bigger works and the play which he considers his best, was written with this sense of the na- tural. It was a typical folk drama. (Continued on Page 4) Dr. Sill at Sunday Chapel Gives Formula for Living \Education and life are coter- minous terms: both have the same limitations,\ Said Dr. Frederick H. Sill, headmaster of the Kent School, speaking in the Sunday chapel service in the Memor•ial Chapel. \Education not only pre- pares for life but lasts for life.\ Upon this theory Dr. Sill bases his formula for education which can be expressed mathematically as \A plus B times C equals :X.\ \A\ stands for one's mind or intel- lectual efforts; \'B\ signifies the body or physical side of life, while \'C\ stands for \all the other things which are not actually mental or physical processes but reach out i'n the r•ealm of the spiritual, such as love of the beautiful, loyalty to ideals, devotion to friends and fam- ily, all summed up in that word 'love.' \X\ denotes the life which the student will lead. \Failure to develop the spiritual side of life is the cause of many of our complications and disap- pointments,\ said the headmaster of Kent School. ··u we have A plus B minus C we have a situa- tion which is a distinct menace to society. Most of our public ene- mies come under that head, and to my regret may I say that many of our public officials are men with splendid mental and physical equipment but sadly laclting iu the appreciation of things of the spirit. A plus B plus C does not seem to result in much. The spirit tagged on to the mind and body does not develop much strength. 'The Beggar's Opera' Analyzed By Union Critics Alter Review Of Play By ARTHUR W. HEPNER The ambitious Schenectady Civic Players presented \The Beggar's Opera\ by John Gay at the Nott Terrace High School auditorium on Wednesday, Thursd·ay, F1 iday, and Saturday nights for the first pro- duction of their eighth subscl'ip- tion season. One is inclined to think of Anthony's ironic comment But Brutus says he was a.rnbi- tious ... \ for the ambition of the Civic Player's almost landed them where it landed Ceasar. All things taken into considera- tion, the performance, as far as the music is concerned, was ama- teurish. Not amateurish because ensemble and technical detail were wanting, but because there \Vas not a voice available for any of the parts. ·what vocal equipment was present in the persons of Ruth Hay as Polly, and Edward Allison Rood as Macheath was sca,rred by a noticeable absence of training. No one in the cast was capable of copiug with the exigent musical requirements laid down by the score. It is ignoble to criticise the Play- ers for attempting to produce The Beggar's Opera. They did their best, and as evidenced by Lhe en- thusiasm and zeal with which they ran through the performance, they were much the gainers for having struggled with the demons of the music. After all, what is art but practicing at something and en- joying it. Thus while the opera, despite the impor•tation of Maestro Alberto Bimboni to facilitate its smooth- ness, was rough, uneven, and far from musical perfection, it was good fun for all who participated and those who elected to see and hear it.

The production made its effect as a whole, and as a whole it was good entertainment. ;:\low for the d1amatic half of the show. The actors carried on for the most part in the manner of the period. There were moments when there seemed to be a question in everybody\s mind as to whether to stylize or not stylize, but in gen- eral formalized gestures a:nd stage g-roupings were very neatly em- ployed. The problem of putting on a period play is always first and for<> most this one; \Shall we. or shall we not do it as it was done when first produced?\ Mrs. W. B. Potter on whom the whole burden of the dramatic end of the per- formance fell, chose the first al- ternative. And she was right. Writ- ten in 1729, The Beggar's Opera is frw too artificial to lend itself to any modern manner of production. The scenic artist also did her worll as of the eighteenth century. Settings of the \wings and back- drop\ variety gave last week's au- diences a glimpse of an unfamiliar and very attractive kind of stage picture, and greatly facilitated the movements of the large groups of people who had to get on and off the stage. There was no outstanding indi- vidual performance. Nobody's movements had the clean-cut qual- ity which really puts stylization over. Everybody wanted very much to make an impression and keep the piece going, and by the grace of the director they succeeded.

Red Cross campaign on the cam- lllinois Pastor Deplores Fox Sees A Trend Methods Used by Hearst Towards Fine Arts What can be done to curb the power which William Randolph Herst now exerts over the Ameri- can press was one of the major questions which Dr. Ernest F. 'Tit- tle, pastor• of .the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Evanston, Illinois, raised at a discussion of the Union College Christian Asso- ciation which was held in the Delta Upsilon House Friday evening. The deplorable use of indecent sensationalism in which nothing is left undescribed and unphoto- graphed, was described by Dr. Tit· tie. Living in Chicago, he sub- scribes to a New York paper which he receives a day late, in order that he may escape the yellow journal. Some legal action should. be incorporated which would serve as a check on the organized press, in the same way that an individual can be sued, according to Tittle. At present, the paper has the in- dividual ruined before the case comes to court. Speaking also on on internation- alism, Dr. Tittle proved himself an extreme pacifist, stating that he thought the present League of Na- tions has possibilities, but some power must be given it so that it may back up its decisions. An ih· ternational police force to replace nationalistic armies, was one of his ideas. Admitting that he too thought that he was fighting in the last war to \save the world for democJ'acy,\ he now is convinced of the utter uselessness of all war. Dr. Ernest M:. Ligon, of the psy- chology depru·tment, and Dr. H. Laurence Achilles, director of reli- gious work and Bible study, at- tended the meeting and partici- pated in the discussion. .o Choir Preparing Music For Christmas Service Preparations for the third annual presentation of Christmas music to be given in the Memorial Chapel, Sunday, December 15 are now un- der way, declared Dr. Elmer A.

Seven Ne1v Opponents to Ap- pear On Vu·sity Court Schedule The Union. College winter sports teams will engage in 45 intercol- legiate contests this season, the largest nutll.ber in over ten years, according to the schedules an- nounced by Professor J. Hal old Wittner, director of athletics. Games for six organized teams were annotLnced including varsity a:nd freshman basketball , varsity and freshman hookey, varsity swimming, and the fencing teams. Seven N ewcom!ll'S Outstanding on the schedule is the list of varsity basketball op- ponents. With. seven new teams listed, the Garnet quintet returns once more to \big time\ competi- tion. St. Lawrence is the first new court opponent on the schedule. They will appear in the Alumni Gymnasium on December 18 in the third Dutchman game of the year. Vermont and Rochester will have met Union here on previous con.- secutive d!tys, the 13 and 14. On the first road trip the Garnet courtmen will meet Columbia Uni- versity. Th.is game will talte place on the day college closes for the Christmas recess, December 20. Among the otl!er new teams which the Union team will meet are C. C. N:. Y., Toronto University, Swarth- more, Haverford and Trinity. Six of the sclled uled games will be played away from the home court. Of the remaining ten. contests, the first three and the last four games, Hamilton, Swarthmore, Haverford and R. P. I., will be home engage- ments. Fll..ll Schedule The frosh basltoteers will engage in six games, all but two being on their home court. Two games coin- cide with the varsity schedule and will be played as preliminarys to the varsity contests . Varsity swimming has a short- ened sched11le having but seven meets, h1.stead of the customary eight-meet season, this year. All of the teams have apneared on the Garnet scbed ule before. The hockey team will meet six opponents with the possibility of a seventh encoun- ter if negotiations with Cornell are completed. The U. S. Military .Acad- emy and Colgate are the major op- ponents of the pucksters. The fencing team will meet five opponents this year with two home- and-ho:me meets arranged. Colgate and Norwich will face the Union swordsnen twice, while Hamilton will be hosts to the Union team on February- 22. Entries for the intramural bas- ketball tournament will close Thursday afternoon at 5 p. m. Team managers a1e requested to place their entrance blanks in the intramural box opposite the bulle- tin board in the gymna:sium as ::;oon as possible. No post entries will be accepted. The winning team will receive a trophy as in the past. In order to gain the participation points a team must not forfeit mote than one game. Additional points will be awarded for each victory made. SWIMMING Entrance blanks are ln. the re- spective group boxes in the gym- nasium for the 11ew!y arranged swimming meet. All entries must be in by Friday noon, Nov. 22. No post entries will be accepted. 0 Frosh-Sophomm·e Contest Is Postponed By Snow The first day intended for prac- tice by the candidates for the sophomore football team was elim- inated when snow blanketed the campus Sunday. Last week at the initial call for prospects for sopho- mores for the class football game against the freshmen, over 20 sec- ond-year men reported to Joe Mi- lano, in charge of the team. Uniforms were not given out to the sophomores, and according to reports from the gymnasium the proposed contest, scheduled for this Saturday, will of necessity be postponed indefinitely. During the past two years, in spite of determined suggestions and half-hearted actio11, the foot- ball game instead of the interclass scraps has failed to materialize. Ac- cording to the present plans, which are very indefinite, the freshmen will be exempted from all fresh- man rules following fraternity in- itiations-if they win the football game. Otherwise, they will adhere to the rules until Moving Up Day. Interested i11 Schenectady Interested itt UNION Maurice B.

Italy, in the name of civilization, has invaded Ethiopia. :Mussolini has offered m.any ex- cuses for the movement he has set about. He says that Elth.iopia is not worthy of receiving th.e rights accorded to civilized nations. This is from the ruler of a nation where boys of eight are taught to carry rifles and throw hand grenades. The fact that Italy sponsored Ethi- npio for LeaguP membership when conditions there were worse gives the lie to th1s statement. Then too, Haile Selassie has admitted the backward condition of his country and has agreed to whatever ad- Visers the League may appoint. After the League investigating committee had found Italian chargPs of Ethiopian aggression to be fal!\c. Mussolini became a little more franlt about Italy's motives. Italy must have colonies to take care of her over-population and to furnish her raw materials. She must have her \sacred place in the sun.~~ Italy is in no position to ta.lk of over-population when her govern- ment is using every means in her power to increase the birth rate and when only an insignificant portion of the great amount of arable land in her colonies is being used. The expenses of subjugating and maintaining control over the natives may malte her g-ains of doubtful economic value. -Hamilton Lite.

(Continued from Page 1) the superior marks of neutrals> Lack of intellectual interest is the. most serious indictment which can be made against the .fraternity.: Fraternities have a detrimental ef-· feet upon character: in three ;vays· according to Cummms: the evrl ef-. fects of rushing, the extravagance involved in fraternity membership and the perversion of fraternities into social clubs, with its pro-: nuunced undemocratic effect. Quotes President Fox : Quoting President Fox, Norman Seagrave of Bowdoin said. \It would be folly to overthrow a human in- stitution with hundreds of thous- ands of members and seventy-five million doHars of property because a few men find that they do not feel the need of fraternities.\ Man is essentially a: social being, said Seagrave, and he seeks the compan-· ionship of other men. If a natural group like the fra·ternity produces evils it must be remembered, he said, that these defects are typical of society itself. The fraternity is an aid to the incoming freshman, furnishing him a new home. Sea- arave claimed that fraternity life ~llows for no deceit or hypocrisy and forces its members to be hon- est. The fraternity is trying hard to overcome its defects and to adapt itself to changes. Professor Edward S. C. Smith, an alumnus of Bowdoin, acted as · chairman of the debate and intro-. duced the speakers. The judges, who listened to the debate over the a:ir, and telephoned in their opin- ions. were Mr. Charles S. Wheeler, principal of Cohoes High School; Reverend Thomas S.

New Idol Evokes Varied Opinion Lighter Material of Recent Is- sue Approved by Cross-sec· tion of Student Opinion True to the predictions of Rob- ert S Langer '36, editor-in-chief the Idol appeared on the campus this week according to schedule. Campus opinion appears to be somewhat divided upon the qual- ity of the issue, but students have generally favored the lightness of its contents over the deeper mate- rial used by last year's editorial board. Langer, in a recent chapel speech, announced that, above all else, the editorial staff was striving for a magazine that would be read. Stu- dents picked at random have ex- pressed almost unanim<;ms approval of the stories printed in the issue, but have, at the same time, made numerous suggestions about the makeup of the magazine. The fraternities take another rap in Van Trumbull's story, Fraternity Meeting, a glimpse behind the closed doors of a secret chapter room. Two articles are the summer experiences of students, while Hen- ry Seider '38 adds a new touch with his parodies. Ferdinand Helm has exposed the thoughts and secrets of a faculty wife and several light sketches which strike a balance with Arthur Hepners exposition on music, Propaganda and the Class Struggle. A new feature is a series of cap- sule book reviews written in verse by members of the Advanced Com- position course. Most students interviewed have spoken favorably of Ecce Homo by Donald Trumbull '36. Poems by Charles Reev~ll '37, Richard Trumbull, S. Ralph Cohen. Fred Frost and John C. Davis, and short stories by Clement Finch and John Hallenbeck complete the Is- sue. B o o lis to l' e Inaugurates New Freshman Cap Plan The recently adapted plan Ior selling of freshman caps through. tbe book store was initiated re- cently when a consignment of· toques were put on sale at the book store. The price of these hats will be sixty cents, a considerable reduc- tion over past years when the bus- iness was handled by local trades- men, Mr. Anthony Hoadley, comp- troller, said that the hats W()uld be equallly good and probably bet- ter than the old ones. Mrs. Jen- kins, in charge of the school, said that the hats we~e darker and heavier than usual. The store will make no profit in the selling of hats, but will charge enough to pay for the handling expenses. 'l'he contract f.or the supplying <lf the toques was given to a knitting mill nearby. Mr. Hoadley said that next year the cap an.d toQue might be sold as a unit to enable a. further saving. Bates College Debates Tonight in Old Chapel A debate on the topic, \Resolved that the IJnited States should parti- cipate in all sanctions invoked by th.e League of Nations against Italy,\ will be held tonight begin- ning at 8:00 p. m. in the Old Cha- pel. Bates College will uphold the affirmative whlle the General Electric Business Training Course will champion the negative. The members of the Bates Col- lege team will be W. Greenwood and C. Mabee, while the General Electric group will he represented by C. Norton and J. Ecl\ler. No de- cision will be rendered after the conclusion of the debate, which will be composed of a fifteen min- ute direct argument, a fifteen min- ut cross xamination, and a six minute rebuttal. All students and other individ- uals interested in the .subject are invited to attend. Snow Removal Undergoes Changes; Tractor Provides Speed, Efficiency By EARLE H. HOUGHTALING Jr. The method of snow removing on the campus bas undet'gone an evolution since the days of the· old grads. The modern three wheel tractor now owned by the college institutes a remarkable improve- ment in swiftness and efficiency of operation over the horse drawn plow of a decade ago, which en- countered great difficulty when heavy drifts appeared. At that time m.any men equipped with shovels were also employed in cleaning off the walks after the horse drawn plow had completed its work. Before using the present modern machine which bas been in opera· tion for the past two years, the college employed a contractor to clear the snow. Since that time the path of tl).e college plow has been followed up by FERA employ- !llent. At present there are few dif- ficulties in removing the snow al- though the tractor still overturns occasionally. The work must be done at once after the snow has fallen in orde:tl for _complete remov- al. When snow Is· not removed promptly after a storm, constant walking over the two miles of cam· pus paths renders the work of the plow more difficult as the snow becomes hard and at times forms an icy covering. In this case salt and dirt are used at an added ex- pense. Mr. Anthony Hoadly, comptrol- ler, when interviewed, emphasized the importance of obeying the pa!'king regulations during the winter in order not to hinder the worlt of the plow which covers the campus at a high speed. He also announced that Professor Charles T. Male, assistant to the comptrol- ler, has laid out several snow fen- ces which will be used this win- ter to prevent excessive drifting. Trial is being given to a new. type of snow plo'W which was used during the r•ecent snowfall and ·will be purchased by the college if found to be effective. Versatile Back, Strong Guard Have Shown Capablity Ernest C. Brown and William K. Potts, Jr. were named co-captains of varsity football for ne:xt season, at elections held this afternoon at 1 o'clock in the gymnasium. Only lettermen aie eligibl'e to vote for the captaincy. Both men have been outstanding in their work on the team this year. A letterman in his sophomore year, Brown opened the season as fullbacK spent a brief trial period as rlght half, and ended calling sig- nals as well as doing an all-round job in thP backfield. Potts has shown himself more than cap•lble of fulfilling the dut- ies of captaincy. Playing guard for the varsity this year. he brought great stiength to the line. Tall and swift, he is one of the best linemen Union has had in recent years. Brown is a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity and was a member of the basketball squad in his freshman year. He played both baseball and football last year, and is a member of the French Club. He graduated from Gloversville High School. Last year Potts played guard, winning a varsity \U\. He also was on the lacrosse team. On the Dean's List in his fresh- man year, Potts •also played with the lacrosse and football squads for the fresh, winning an award as guard in football. ---o--- Snyder Explains Italian Aggression in Ethiopia The intelligent appraisal of the Italo-Ethiopian affair calls :for a broad viewpoint, with consideration for both sides of the question, cau- tioned Richard Snyder, '37, in a chapel speech Wednesday on the political situation in Europe. Premier Mussolini has excuses for his \African adventure\ in the grudge his people have for their de- feat by the Ethiopians in 189>8, he continued. The physical limitations of Italy makes it necessary for II DucP to find a place to expand his crowded population and where na- tura:! resourses and raw materials are obtainable. It is necessary to center the interest of the people on an outside problem to take their minds off internal trouble. At this point Mussolini cannot turn back because he is on trial as to whether he can provide the Italian people with what they vitally need or not. On the other hand, Snyder point- ed out that Ethiopia is a Christian nation, which has been doing away with slavery since 1928. Moreover she has upheld her international obligations by agreeing to submit the whole dispute to arbitration, while Italy has violated the Kellogg Peace Pact, the Tri-Partite Agree- ment of 1906 and five articles of the l.eague Covenant. \We are witnessing a phenome- non never before witnessed. that of fifty-one nations uniting to punish one nation which has gone against the will of the rest,\ he stated in terminating his discussion of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. ---o--- Workmen Race \Vinter In Hale Hall Construction Work on the new eonunons is progressing rapidly, with the con- tractor doing his best to complete the exterior before snow and cold weather arrive to slow up the job. Yesterday workmen completed the excavation under what is to be the dining hall, removing three feet of earth so that the floor tim- bers will not rest on the ground as before. The walls and floor of the con- necting link between what will be the kitchen and the dining hall have been finished, and the roof is now being built. Nothing re- mains of the old Nott barn but the end walls and the slightly rotten roof. The scaffolding along the sides of South Colonnade is all in place, but no work has been done as yet on the new roof on the east end. If weather conditions remain fav- orable the construction wot·k shoUld be completed well ahead of schedule.

If this en- thusiasm continues, the average student may cease to be a mere spectator, may develop into an active spo1·tsman. This v<.·ould be a healthy improvement. !Jefure the institution of this enlarged pl·o- gmm, intet'est in campus athletics was not g-eneral. Interfratemity games we1·e played with luke\\·arm interest. :Many contests \Vere forfeited. The arrangements were vag-ue and unsystematized. Certain enthusiastic groups ente1·ed all the meets; others were as apathe- tic as they are toward varsity spo1:ts. It was hnrdly an athletic system for even·one. As the system is now organized there are definite rules and restrictions that apply to all spol'ts. There is ample incentive for tak- ing- part in all phases of the program. \Inde- pendent\ teams are organized on a fairer basis. It i::; the duty of every individual and every fraternity to cooperate with the Athletic De- partment in this project. With student sup- pmt this system might easily grow into a really unique intramural program. The De- partmeiJt has added enough new events to int2re:::t almost anyone. The plan is work- able. Hs success depends upon student recog- nition. A NOif-1ELESS LIBRARY We understand that a shameful percent of the student body has landed on probation this marking period and, judging from letters written by our readers, this condition is largely the result of boiler-factory acoustics in the librm·y.

The opening scene shows the young man getting on the train at the railroad station of his small Ohio town. In one hand he waves a thiclt manusct·ipt, his show. His sweetheart stands with him be- seeching him to remember her. They kiss, and then she goes into a tap dance, the 1 outine tor which she learned by the Gt ace of God apparently. As she dances she sings, \I'll be seein' you, tho you'll be far away. Every day, once more I say, whatever you do, I'll be see- and greets her old love in the Grand Central Station with a dance accompanied by the song, 'Tm happy, seein' you again. m the snow or rain, I'm happy, seein' you again!\ Then they proceed to a rehearsaL But the rest of the ca::;l leaves because they aren't being paid. The absence of the lady backer mean,; no money. Hew and heroine summon a chor- us from the small Ohio town. They wer·e trained by the hero when he was back home learning to be a showman. But still there's no money for settings and ropes. Then the heroine·s millionaire uncle who has always hated the theatre comes incognito to a rehearsal and sees his niece dance and sing, \I've got a feeling right here, down in my heart. I ain't been drinkin' beer. But we're apart. So I've got a feeling right here, down in my heart. He is entranced and pays all the debts. The show goes on. The ex-star comes and sits in a box to gloat over its failure. But it succeeds with hero and heroine singing the leads. The curtain falls through a long fadeout. F. H. ---·0--- NOTES ON OUR CONTEMPORARIES Harvard vs. .l\larconi The United States can thank it- self for forcing China off the sil- ver standard on to a managed paper system. Closely ·bound up with this change is the r.umor that the British had negotiated a huge loan with the Chinese government which made the Japa11ese very an- gry, so angry, in fact, that when a Japanese marine was killed in Shanghai, Japan exhibited far more military actions than the occasion deman.aed, and scared thouo>ands of Chinese from the region of ChapeL * * * The Armistice speech of Presi- dent Roosevelt demonstrates very cle:uly the paradox existing with 1 egard to world peace. in one place Mr. Roosevelt makes an impa<- sioned plea for world peace Pnd pledges AmericGn co-operation to whatever drastic means necessaty to accomplish this end. A few mo- ments later the same man in the same speech states that Amer lean armament will match that of Eu- t·ope, program for program. * * * Joseph Stalin has predicted that the government of the Soviet Union wil\ receive less and less emphasis until it finally dies out of existence. A complete communist society will cause this. * * The German veterans organiza- tion, the Stahlhelm, was abolished by Hitler. This group marked the last vestige of monarchist support- e'!'s. This act concentrates a:!l of German armed power in the hands of the Reichswehr. This will prove important; should the army ever decide that they no longer wanted Hitler as their leader, Hitler would be out. For instance, how many of us have thought deeply enough the African wm- to realize that there is something- to be said for iltaly. Nor by such an exposition need we be accused of justifying l\lussolini's action.

The majority of the nations of the world have agreed that wm·, as an instrument of national policy is illegal. Italy has violated this accepted law of nations as a broad prin- ciple. The1·ein lies .:\Iussolini's indictment and also, most unfortunately, therein the reason- ing- of most people comes to a premature end. The question the world must answer is not so much what are we going- to do with Italy, as it is what are we going to do about world conditions which nurtme ::>uch a dis- ease as imperialism. Are those nations who, with their heat:s high in the air in the manner of liquor-re- formers, now condemn the Italian people, prepared to give peaceably what that g-1 eat nation of rich cultural heritage vitally needs? Surely Christ himself would do eve1r.hing in his power to understand Italy's problt:m a!lG sacrifice his own posses,sions to help her. Bui can we imagine, even being over- generous that those nations which broke their prom- ises to Italy in 1919 after using h:r welcomE. military aid, would now consider giving up certain non-vital parts of their African pos· sessions in order that the Italian people could be happy again? Of course not. These na- tions have all they want of th.e world's choice sections. They obtained those empires by force. Then they made a law against such action in the future. Now they condemn a nation who uses the only weapon at her dis- posal to preserve her life. England looks down upon a globe which shows the pink color of British influence like it had the measles, and then turns to Italy and says, \Colonial war? Nonsense.\ Therefore, let us really be Christians, not in word alone, but in our actions. Let us not pray inside, and pose outside the church. Let us look at this problem not through the eyes of an American or Englishman, but through the eyes of an intelligent, generous human being. The earth is too big, life is too big, and God is too big for us to be inconsiderate and bigoted. \Mary Burns, f<'ugitive\ sounded like another egg that Hollywood had lain and was now crowing about in half~hearted fashion, but you can't tell by the names.

Terry ran 115 yards for a touchdown, starting fr~m five yards behind his own goal line. The feat could not be duplicated today. It has been im- possible since 1912, when the old 110-yard field was shortened to the present 100-yard length, Oysters R in Season . Drl A. S.

When the fraternity man wishes to know his marks, under the pre::;- ent system. he has only to await at hi::; frat house the arri\·al of an envelope bearing- the desired re- port. He recetves this envelope hours before the distribution to neutrals commences.

GILBERT Last Saturday night we went over to Hanna Hall to see the Mountebanks' latest production, Maxwell Anderson's biting satire on the United States government, Both Yolll' Houses. We must ad- mit we were more pleased with the whole affair than the man who sat near us. He spent his time reading the first two acts of The Front I'a.ge. We noticed that the only times he looked up at the stage 'Was when an actor over- shadowed. the light streaming through the proscenium. .Amateur actors can mutilate a good drama and th.e local boys gave us a hint that they too could muss up a play, but most o.f tile rough spots were so well smoothed out by the forceful acting of Messrs.

We were glad to see a new face in the cast, especially when· .its owners proved to be as convincing a character actor as Mr. Hennes- sey. Without his support the first act would have sagged. Only once, that during the last act, did Hen- nessey fail to steal the show as the de-winged political Saint, Soloman Fitzmaurice.

The second incident which Dt'. Ca.mpbell used was in reference to the football games between the two local high schools which took ·place on Alexander field on the same day. This contest, he pointed out, was a fine exhibition of loy- alty and enthusiasm of the most spirited kind. Dr. Campbell then drew a paral- lel between those two incidents and a political rally he witnessed in Berlin, which partoolt of the char- acteristics of both the football game a.nd the political incident. He saw 50,000 spectators boiling in hot and spirited enthusiasm-just as if tb.ey were at a football rally-lis- tening to a dictator who was ask- ing them to denounce democrac:y and to substitute a more emotional fol'm of government, motivated by some emotional type of loyalty. A bouquet, with no brick insert- ed, may be hurled at Mr. Reynolds. He did justice to the important role of Alan McClean, Nevada school teacher, turned into a re- forming senator.

From The main portion of this report concerns itself with the Water Mu- sic Suite of Handel, a work which. has been bandied from musician to musicologist, from musicologist to layman, and back again, all in an effort to 1·earn whether Handel wrote the suite as abstract or pro- gram music. While there has been con~iderable scepticism in several minds incident to the authenticity of the story that Handei composed the suite to serve as a recof,l:cl!ia- tlon ·pact between King George, the former Elector of Hanover, and himself, the researches of that in- defatigable Handel scholar, Dr. Ja- cob Maurice Coopersmith, reveal beyond all reasonable doubt that :he tale is fantastic. Dr. Cooper- smith, working amon;g the archives of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Lon- don, discovered that the publisher, Chrysander, affixed the title Water Music SUite to a concerto grosso of Handel's whose themes resem- bled nautical tunes some fifteen years after it had been composed. How, under this consideration, can people calling themselves scholars of the art of music, accept this fa- bulous tale as history? and Thanksg·iving Eve was the most log-ical lious crew.

Frederick Wyatt to supervision of the Placement Bureau fo1· Union graduates indicates the interest which the administration is taking in secul\ing suit- able employment fo1· students who have fin- ished college. Last spring the Placement Bureau was or- ganized by l\Iiss Frances Trads, as an ex- tension of her work in finding part-time em- ployment for undergraduates. Now, as Dt·. Fox exp1·esses it, \generous co-opemtion\ has made it possible to relieve 1\Ir. Wyatt of his duties as Co-ordinator of Student Activities so that he may devote his time and energies to running an augmented placement bureau. The announcement shows that Union is falling in line with the general patemalistic trend among American colleges in helping her graduates to get jobs. This service has become increasingly popular since the de- pression, and is invariably menti()ned promi- nently in college catalogues. From the employer's point of view, as well as from that of the job-seeking alumnus, a college employment bureau can give a val- uable se1·vice. A man's college record is al- ways a factor in deciding whether or not to hire him.

Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer in bringing it to the screen used a book ''Mutiny on the Boun- ty\ by Nordhaff and Hall. Much of the incident and narrative of the picture is derived from that source. CRIME AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCE \\\'e have not sharpened our social consci- ences to keep pace with the complexity of modern life. So many of our crimes are com- munal, spread out over millions, with no one man to blame,\ said Dr. Har<lld A. Larrabee in an interview on crime p1·evention broad- cast last week. The interview was provocative because it illustrated the modem view of crime as a so- cial disorder instead of a numbet· of individ- ual acts. The simple crimes of passion and violence are not nearly as dang·erous to so- ciety as are the great organized rackets and the ramified business enterJ.>rises which en- joy the protection of the government and the acquiescence of the majodty of people. As the frank, hard-bitten politician says in \Both Your Houses,\ the business of gov- ernment is \graft special privileg-e, and cor- ruption, with a by-product of <lrder. You have to keep ordet·, or you can't make collections.\ Lincoln Steffens found out long ag-o that muck-raking, exposm·e and punishment were not enough, r€forrn administrations were not enough, to eliminate the criminal parasites from society. It is not a question of assign- ing personal blame and punishing the offen- ders, but of revising the social order which allows such conditions to flourish. PARKING ON CAMPUS Violations of the colleg-e parking regula- tions have been particularly common along South Lane in front of the Delta Upsilon and Psi Upsilon houses, the Chapel, and on North Lane in front of the Electrical Engineering building, the Biology laboratory, and th€ Kappa Alpha lodge. With winter approaching, the problem of parking cars on the campus becomes mor€ acute. The college lanes are not made to ac- commodate a row of parked cars and still permit two-way traffic. Adequate parking space is available, however, in the regular parking areas; and these areas are so distrib- ted abCYUt the campus as to allow parking automobiles within a snowball's throw of any college building- or any fraternity house. The story and dialogue are very ably w·ritten. This fact in conhec- tion with the splendid acting and directing make the picture a best ten candidate. \Mutiny on the Bounty\ reputed- ly cost its studio two million dol- lars, two years and one life. Scenes were filmed at Tahiti and two de- plicas of the Bounty were built. An expensive cast was assembled which included many old time char- acter actors and extras in addition to such current headliners as Clark Gable, Charles Laughton, Franchot Tone and lesser lights such as Don- ald Crisp and Dudley Digges. The critical faculty has been fair- ly unanimous in praising the pic- ture. A common criticism has been that the picture is too long. This reviewer admits that its length is apparent but can only think of how much less gratifying the wol'k would have been shorn of any footage. Individual pel'formanees were of a uniformly high standard. Laughton in his portrayal of the disdpline-mad captain has been ac- cused of making a sadistic ogre of a strict man on one side and of being divinely inspired on the other. That he does a superb ·piece of work is generally admitted. I have always objected to him and still do for his extreme attention to tech- nique. Still he managed to reduce a Sunday audience of howling brats to boos at one .point and cheers at his downfall. Much of the dialogue was lost because of the incessant noise from these over-emotionalized children. Mention is certainly due the two Tahitian girls who provide love in- terest. They contribute the most natural and lovely acting to the screen that I have seen in a long while.

Tidmarsh announced to the audience on Sunday that he was aware of this finding, but he con- sidered it negligible because the story made for nice telling. It seems that such an attitude is more detrimental to an appreciation of the music than it is beneficiaL Aft- er all, the audience here has grad- uated from the kindergarten stag.e. Such stories are delightful and re- markably imformative for chil- dren. Even at .that they are some- what dang·erous, for the words of Dr. Carl Engel still ring in my ears, \Remember that even for ~hildren you must be sm·upulously accurate and reasonably clear in presentation.\ If we neglect Dr. Engel's caution- ing and concede the fable to the children, we cannot pull the wool over .adults' eyes as well. Dr. Tid- marsh is educating a mature audi- ence and until economics is allowed to be taught by employing the story of King Midas as an allegory, such stories as the quarrel between Han- del and the King cannot be accept- ed as an aid to the understandh;1g of music. What then, do you a:!k, is the Water Music Suite if it is not pro- gram music? It is a concerto grosso based upon the contrasts explained in last week's remarks. This partic- ular grosso is one of a set of twelve which Handel w~:ote during Sep- tember and October of 1739. Dr. Charles Burney, the elegant musi- cal globe-trotter of the eighteenth century, in writing about the twelve concerti says \so much !business is done in so short a time; nothing is left unsaid; and though they (the first movements) begin with so much pride and haughtiness, they melt at last into softness; and wherever they modulate into a min- or key, they seem to express fa- tigue, languor, and fainting.\ Dr. Tidmarsh did not play the complete second movement; he omitted the mellifulous contrasting section. For the first and: fifth movements, he substituted tw{} al- ternatives .for the regular score which, incidently,, has been orches- tl·ated by Leopold Stokowski. For my part, I shouJd like to know why Dr. Tidmarsh employed -sulbsti- tutes for the wonderful andante and for the glorious first movement abotJt which Dr. Burney .has writ- ten so eloquently. The suite loses most of its flavor when heard: on the organ. \·and the shorl:est: distance belween · ~hese two poini:s.

Twice on fourth Phil Little Captain With a nucleus of four lettermen to build a team a·round, At·t Lawr- ence hopes to make his first season as head coach of the hockey teams a successful one. Besides Captain Phi'! Little, Bob Warner, Hugo Bergman, and Ken Tompkins who won their \hUt's\ last season, a strong delegation from the frosh sextet headed by Fritz; Hawley, Johnny Wold, and Art Breymaier will make strong bids fot· f·irst team posts when practices commence about December 1. One man who will be missed is Charles Little, stalwart ::;ophomot e defense man who has been render- ed null and void by his professors. Charles is a brother of the ca.ptain who also operates at defense. Ken Tompkins and Ed Arundel are ex- pected to be first choices for goalie at this early date. However, none of ·the positions are definitely set, and win not be until the squad has had a chance to work out for a few weeks. The first game will be with Middlebury at home on January 8. Nineteen men make up the squad which reported to Lawr•ence last week. They are John Ernans, Dave Becker, Bob Shepard, Jamie Bond, John Hardinar, Doc Orton, Jerry Va:n Beuren, Frank Phillips, Frank Peck, Alex Merriman, Kennedy, Arundel, Wold, Hawley, Breymaier, Tompkins, Bergman, Warner-, and Captain Little, Included among the freshmen puck chasers, who fa<!e a four game chart beginning with Albany Acad- emy on January 11, a1e Coleman, Juracka, S. L. Smith, F. B. Vander- bilt, Henry Clay, Ed Wells, Joe Paul, Joe Annese, A. S. Knight, Ed O'Connor, Miller, Jim Mulcare, J. Kyle, A. G. Borden, and Peter S. O:wens. In stzmg .up their individual capabilities, Milano probably rates number one man, having been high scorer for two years. Waldr-on seems to have acquired an excel- lent knaClk of retrieving- back- board rebounds, as well as having developeq. a better eye than he dis~ played lB:st year. Smith, gifted· by his height and shooting ability, nevertheless needs improvement in the field of foul tossing and dr-ib- bling, I?riznar and Griswold are fine, steady players, rating espe- cially high on defensive play and ball handling, as Is the case with Brand(}W, who, although handi- capped by his midget-like dimen- sions, makes up for it by his spirit and excellent judgment.

This completes the efforts of the sages for the year with all three of them ahead of the averages made by last year's dopesters.

Four Outing Club Skiis At Skiihaben Lake Winter Season Opened as Ten Members Take Trip To North. Cabin Zero weather and cold ~risp snow introduced the winter season to members of theOuting Club who journeyed to their cabin at Thir- teenth Lake last week-end. Several pairs of skils had been .brought along on the strength of a report that there had been a snowfall at North Creek early in the week de- spite the lack of snow in Schenec- tady on Saturday. Snow over a foot deep proved ample for exciting ski- ing and a number of spills. Arriving at Sldihaben late Sat- urday afternoon the party of ten first cooked supper and then sev- eral of the more hardy members went over to the pi·actice hill and skiied In the starlight. Any previ- ous doubts as to whether or not winter had really arrived were re- moved when inspection of a ther- mometer revealed the mercury to be hovering only a few degrees above the zero mark. During the evening one of the party almost lost his life when others shivering under their too few blankets heard :him complain that his sleeping bag was too warm for comfort. Sunday morning was spent by those who had broug·ht equipment in skiing, while the rest of the party explored an old garnet mine located nearby. The mine was aban- doned in 1928 when quality of its ore .depreciated. Wandering through the old grinding mill, the explor- ers found in what had formerly been the office old letters and files dating back to 1897. Among them were interesting old .post cards and letters. The extent of the company's 'business was indi- cated by orders .from Scotland, Ja- pan, Germany, and England. The lo~ation <Jf the club's cabin at Thirteenth Lake provides excel- lent facilities for skiing and to- .bogganing for anyone from the amateur to the professional level of slti·ll. ·Only a few rods away ft·om THE CONOORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26; 1935 Play Pleases Critic I Fou ,.
