Lockwood Forsees Progress in the Arts By PA.UL FARNHAM \The real commitment by the col- lege to do what is necessary to put it In the front rank of private liberal arts colleges'' is what Dean of the Faculty Theodore D. Lockwood de- scribed as the most impressive change he has seen during his stay at Union. Lockwood, who officially leaves his office tomonow, specified various as- pects of the commitment. He said that the launching of a development pro- gram will help to \raise the resources necessary to carry out this objective.\ In addition, he cited that curricular changes have given Union new and distinctive programs, and that much has been accomplished to help solve the problems of life on campus and create ''the kind of envoronment that we want.\ Lockwood commented that the addi- tion of the Student Orchestra and the Philharmonia show that the college is making progress in the arts. The establishment of the All College Coun- cil has provided a mechanism for true community government of ad- ministration, faculty, and students. The commitment \to move ahead as an institution and stay abreast of what is happening\ has been exemplified by the review ·of the possibilities of day time graduate studies and of co- education. \We are operating more effectively as an institution although the demands are growing by leaps and bounds,\ Lockwood stated_ Commenting on the curriculum, Lockwood stated, \Comp. Ed. offers the structure b try bold and daring things.\ Although he is aware of the problems involved, Lockwood is glad that \we took the dive.\ At least the progvam has set people thinking and ta-lking about the curriculum. AIDother important aspect, Loek- W()O~ maintained, is the limiting of tl'te major and the commitment to ; C()UI.\ses rather than semester h<;urs. Because each course should be of equal value and each major should t'e'ql.lire equal effort, this provides a m~re coherent view of the curriculum. Lockwood noted that many majors have changed substantially in the past few years. The policy of only two requ:ired courses in the freshman year has pr<>vided \the kind of flexibility we badly needed_\ .Even more flexibility will result if th.e :J-5 plan is adopted. This would give students the opportunity to ob- tain an undergraduate degree in three year:s and a masters in five years . Ail of these ideas are \signs of fresh willingness to look at the aca- demic program as being more flex- ible and open to experiment.\ 1()ck:wood foresees that many of his pr()b Ierns at Trinity College will be sin1ilar- to those he has faced at Union . He stated, \Both Trinity and Union must define their objectives. The priv- ate I.iberal arts college must stay on its toes ·or it will be in deep trouble. It m 11st know what is going on else- wh.ere and be prepared to make ad- justments.\ .A:lthough Lockwood officially steps do\Jn tomorrow, he and his family will live on campus until late June wnea Trinity President Albert C. Jacobs retires. During this time he will i!e studying, meeting with other coUege presidents and trustees, and becoming better acquainted with the iss11es facing Trinity.

In addition to the sttide.nt spon_sored gatherings for pr()spective applicants held over Christrnas vacation, mem- bers of the Gatesmen are nmy C!Jn- ducting interviews and ~evwwnw student folders.

Cavalier outlined Graves seven-level theory as follows: one, vegetable, two, survival, three, an awareness of forces within and without, four, a pow~r of self and a mastery of worldly thmgs, five, the possession . of seU-este~m and sensoral powers, s1x, a personality not motivated by fears, and seven, a higher level of refinement with all fears conquered. Professor Graves' course, taught as part of the Comprehensive Education program is entitled \Concepts of Human Behavior\. rn his 14 years of research, the article adds Professor Graves te~ted his hypothesis with this question: \What is your conception of a healthy human personality?\ The answer, the professor says, places the r~sponder in one of the seven categones. While Cavalier had nothing but kind words for Union's 52-year-old professor and his theory, th;e mag~­ zine found room to take a d1g at h1s college and its student body. Union's students, the article said, are noted if anything, for being un- remarkable. Running at best second fiddle to Playboy, funny it should say that. Little did Cavalier know that the remarkable Professor Graves is one of Union's mediocre, as it were, graduates. a report from the college trustees approving proposals for off-campus living beginning Sept., 1968. A com- mittee was organized to study on- campus living and attempt to encour- age on-campus living.

Two main prob- lems were cited: To many people have been cutting through campus in cars and students have abused park- ing on campus. The possibilities of closing gates prohibiting townspeople from using the campus roads as a passageway and the enforcement of stiffer parking fines were discussed. Jlr~sident Harold C.

ROCK WARNER FUND DRIVE _STARTED; TO CONTINUE EDUCATION AT' UNION HOPES TO ENABLE INJURED JUN·I~OR. '. ·~- l •'. • l The Rock Warner Educational Fund Drive will begin ()n the Union campus Monday. It is hoped that each stu- dent will take it upon himself to view this effort as an opportunity to aid a fellow student. Last year as a sophomore, Robert Warner was an outstanding physics major. This year \Rock\ is in the N.Y.U. Institute ()f Rehabilitory Medi- cine struggling to overcome a crip- pling injury sustained in an auto- mobile accident last July. Rock shat- tered the third through seventh verte- brae in his neck, which all but de- stroyed the spinal cord in that area. For two months following the acci- dent, Rock VIas paralyzed from the neck down. It was not until recently that he has regained some degree of muscular control and sensory percep- tion in his arms. Through his own persistence and determination, he should continue to improve steadily. With the continued therapy of his doctors, he '\Vill hopefully regain the use of his upper body, However, bar- ring a major medical breakthrough, Rock will never walk again. Rock's unfortunate situation has re- sulted in the organization of a com- mittee of his friends from various fraternities and living units on cam- pu.s. The immediate goal of this com- mittee is to raise enough money to heJ.p Rock return to Union, which is his .greates wish. At the moment R()>ck's medical expenses total over $1,0()0 a week and when the family's insunnce policy terminates shortly, this lll.lge financial burden will have to be fully assumed by the Warners. It is the expressed desire of this ne>vl:y formed committee to make it po:ssLble for the Warners to finance R()ck:'s rehabilitation and his contin· ue<l <Education at Union. Four hundred forty four of Uni()n's Fall term students made one of two Dean's lists, Dean Lockwood's ofiice amtounced this week.

Crisis Unlimited The college is now going through a state of crisis in regard to the Comp. Ed. program. The outcome of this crisis may well determine tl~e fut~re success <?f the colle~e in its efforts be a viable meamngful contnbutor to Its students intellectual maturity. It seems that the Comp. Ed. program was proposed as a sort of magic panacea for all the ills of a ~m~ll, private, literal arts college. The program was hastily mtroduced and has been the subject of numerous debates and re- visions sin~e. At present, it is the object of heated debate among the faculty, and scorn among the student body. The basic problem with Comp. Ed. is, firs~ of all, _that an impressi.ve course structure produces only Impressively structured courses, not academic excellence and distinction. Innovative courses that are of shallow substance and are intellectually sterile challenge neither the students in the course or th.e professors teaching them. Sue~ courses do not attract top-rate young faculty members, (It encourages them to go elsewhere), or generous ~inanc~al support. What is important is that courses be as strn~ulatmg and challeng- ing to stu.dent and faculty as possible. The Comp. Ed. courses ha. ve failed miserably in this regard. A major contributing factor to the plight ~f Co.mp. Ed. at Union is the apparant lack of central direction and purpose with which it was conceived. The latest propo~ed revisions are merely futile attempts to attach a steermg wheel to a. ship without a rudder. Even more disturbing than the sad state of Comp. Ed. itself ie the unsympatl:etic and arbitrary way the recent revh;ions have been, and continue to be shoved. down the throats of the faculty and student body. With constant pressure from the administration, the various proposals have been, and continue to be passed in the face of stiff faculty opposition. Perhaps for some, the passage of the program bas become a matter of personal prestige or reputation. If this be so, it is indeed a black omem for Union's future. Some faculty members are known to fear that salary cuts and delayed promotions will be used as reprisals aga..inst those who continue to oppose the passage of the pfC>pcsals. This is th~ low~st form of P<?l~tics to which a C()liege can stoop. It IS dehbez:a~ely sacnfwmg t~e future of the college to personal ambitions. We hope this fear is completely unfounded. After months and months of fighting against the pro- gram, it seems that the faculty resistance has been wor,n down to the point where the passage of new proposals IS assured. Students can only try to estimate the damage to faculty morale that !::as resulted from this whole ugly mess. How long some of our better professors will tolerate such conditions is an important matter for contemplation. It is perhaps best that the Comp. Ed. proposals pass now, so that the college can stop its headlong rush down the road to mediocrity. Perhaps once the issue is settled, the college can begin t<? go give some con_si~eration. to other important college Issues, such as admiSSions policy and a student union. Hopefully, out from under the pres- sure, and after the torn nerves have healed, the faculty can begin to modify the Comp. Ed. program to give it some substance .and direction. We certainly hope this would be the case. If the program continues to drift, we can only expect that the quality of both the students and t~e faculty will suffer. Tl::ese elements make a college dis- tinguished, not .an \innovative\ program. \If yC>u don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.\ This is the story of Comp. Ed. lmowl'edge, and satis£action of i:nner goals. To call these goals .c:lealistic would be an under· ;tateme:nt. However, they serve as guidelines and as an ultimate perfection to seek. Any organi· zation which helps students to becorne well-rounded men is contributing to the College com munity. My fraternity hopes to help men develop their charac- ter in the ways not covered in classroom instruction. Are fraternities competing with the college for allegiance? Are we an organization consist· ing of Union College students living in a building owned by the College? Fraternities can· not survive without a college, and we try not to forget this fact. We maintain communica· tion with our alumni through a chapter newsletter published eight times a year. Once a year we have an alumni reunion dinner. About two graduates from our chapter return to the college each month to do busi- ness or just to see all the new buildings. They are treated as guests of honor by us, and they know that they have a standing invitation to any meal that we serve. I am told by the Alumni Relations Office that fraternity men are the most active sup· porters of the College. As undergraduates, fraternity men seem to be well represent- ed in most campus activities- It is significant to notice that the Brown Cup ratings give great importance to extracurricular participation. Is it not true that some fra- ternities at Union have national charters which deny member· ship to people of certain relig- ious and racial groups? I know of no fraternity at Union with such a charter or constitution and I believe that Dean Pollock made a similar statement to The Concordiensis several years ago. Fraternities are not as strong as they might be at Union. This is not a fault of the organiza- tions, but of the members. My fraternity has expanded on ten campuses in the past four years at the invitation of the respec- tive institutions. Certainly these colleges and universities must have investigated our fraternity carefully before giving such an invitation. No one would want an organization on campus like the one described in the letter to the editor last week. I am willing to talk about my fraternity in private with any• one having questions, and I am sure that most house presidents feel the same way. Robert S.

E'D. REPORT By STE'VE FOX News of the u:pcoming vote on certain arr,end ments to the Com- prehensive Edu<:ation program, reported in the last issue of Coli- cordiensis, hash.elped revive the long-standing :faculty contro- versy over the ,p:resent state and future direction of Union's two year old experiment. The de- bate has now, hDwever, gone un- derground. A recent survey showed that many professors were unwiUing to make any statement on .the matter until after Friday's decisive faculty meeting- A few teachers that were willing t() make definite statements for or against what will probably lead to a new shape, and :the creation of a framework f<>r Senior year classes, had sur}lrisingly strong opinions. Leaders of the opposition is English Pro:fef!sor Frank Gado, who appeared .()n WRUC's talk show, WRUCus last Sunday night. His resistance to Comp. Ed. began witll the inception of the old plan 1 ih11t some of his criticisms deal with the new direction the ~clministration in- tends to give its program. He believes that tile school failed by \not agreeing on the content of the coursef!. Approach was considered mue important than the content.\ .As a result, cours- es are in peripheral areas, a reg- ular smorgasbord,\ and since \nobody takes the program seri- ously, there is general apathy and lack of inter-est on the parts of student and faculty alike.\ In the future, for instance, he cannot see ho\~ the Junior class, divided into groups of six under 1 a professor, can possibly succeed enough to ju.stify their exist- ence. When a ~aller came on to point out the great success of a similar cours~, \Invention and Innovation,\ t~11ght by Profes- sor Lowen last year, where small groups of students experimented with creative-]Jt-oblem solving, Gado answered by asking If ' such an appr<>aeh could work \vhen formaliz:ecl. It wou:d be necessary to g~t .enough people who were interested in analyz- ing problems hEfore such experi- ments wou d \\\ork. He himself would like to ''have a course in how Comp. Eel. came to be as a study of indirection.\ Although he :l>elieves that the program will ne\Ver succeed be· cause of student and faculty out- look, he has no doubt it will be passed. He would like to see courses that provide a survey of the intellectual ideas of the East and West, curr-ent problems, and an introductiol! to science. Gado's belief that the present science com)}:rellensive educa- tion courses are too remotely concerned with humanitarian in- terests illustra1es the difference Saratoga Caffe Lena: Temporarily Closed D'Andreas: Sour Hour, 4:30 to 6 p.m., Fxiday Rip Van llatn: Happy Hour, 6-9 p.m., •F'ri<lay Troy Tri-City Dri\7e-1n (Sc;reen One) The Soft Sldn,\ \Sweet Ec- stacy,\ '\'1. o vel y Sex.\ (Screen 'Jlvvo) \Door to Door Maniac,\ \Thunder Al- ley,\ \Saclismo.\ in Comp.

Professor Ke- vark Nehabedian, Chemistry, counters by saying that if sci- ence is approached only .by a generalistic, humanistic attitude, then \you're overlooking things of science which motivate the pure scientist who has direct, not simply humanistic invo,\·c- ment. Another .science profes- sor pointed out that the human- ists needed to understand some- thing of the scientific mind. While the average Hberal arts man claims to be weE-rcunded yet knows almost noth:ng ab· ut science, the scientist frequent'y speaks and reads French or Ger- man, is involved with social problems, and writes well in English. Prof. Henry M. Butzel, Biology, thinks that the science Comp. Eds. have \a great re· sponsibility to the nonscientist to explain in a rigorous but non- technical way the contribution of science.\ In the proposed Junior year courses, the Engi- neering, Chemistry, Biology and Phy'lics Departments can demon- strat~ their importance in un- derstanding and improving many modern conditions in civiliza- tion. Prof. Samson Ullman, English, has faith in the ultimate good of continuously e v o I v i n g Comp. Ed. Since there will be a faculty board to select the best available professors for Comp. Ed. courses, perhaps with the help of the Student Evaluation Polls, one favorite complaint will be eliminated. The very idea of Comp. Ed. he considers good, since \experimental kinds of courses are required if Union is to compete. Experimentation is essential if we are to survive as .first rate institution.

But they agreed due to tile urging of the Sov.iet Union, which assured them of in- ·dep.endence and a guarantee o:f national identity. The United States, which had been giving two-thirds of the financial back- ing .t() the French military, was Mit ,prepared to accept the in- .tem~ational agreement resulting .from the (;eneva Conference. A..cc()rding to the Geneva De- clal\'ation of Jaly, 1954, the di- vided· Vietnam would be re- Ullited by an election in 1956. It was ·expressly stated that the JDilitary demarcation line es· tablished between the northern and sourthern parts of the coun- try in enforcing a cease-fire was \J>rovisional and should not in any way- be interpreted as con- stituting a political or territorial bvu11dary,\ T'be United States would not agt:ee \to the Geneva Declaration. Tlle pro l>able reason was, in the words of President Eisenhower, that \. . . had the elections been •held as of that time ... possibly ,g() per cent of the populace ·WOI.lld •llave voted for tile Com- munist Ho Chi Minh as their leader.\ Secretary of State Dulles did nvt want to give any further grm.ind to Communists whether the people did or did not want them and whether or not the Communist leadership was also nationalistic. Howeve~, at this point~ the United States spoke of Vietnam as a nation \new div.ided .against its will\ in its declaration following the Geneva Declaration. It .did not speak of a separate southern state. In 1955, the French withdrew their forces from Vietnam and transferred }lolitical . power to the Saigon•regime of Bao Dai. Ngo Dinh Diem, who had heen in the United States between 1950 and 1954, l'eplaced Bao Dai as ruler and subsequently had strong American economic back- ing. The Diem regime never had popular support in the south, for the Vietnamese remembered that it was Ho Chi Minh and the Vietminli who had driven out the French and divided up the estates of absentee land- lords. In 1955, Diem, with Atner· ican encouragement, announced that elections wotrld not be held. Until 1958, Hanoi made several attempts to arrange elections. By his refusal to hold an elec- tion, the undoing of agarian reforms Ro Chi Minh had car- ried out, and by his Festoration of the colonial landlord system, Diem, not Iio Chi Minh, was the cause of the ensuing civil war. By 1957 • .gueriJla warfare had broken oat in the south. The leadership was not necessarily Communist and the soldiers were nationalistic and anti-Diem. Former Vietininh leaders living in the South eventually took control of military activities against the Diem regime, which had built up the Soatll Viet- namese army over the prescrib- ed limit .of 150,000 set at Geneva. In 1959, a campaign was organ- ized to selectively assassinate village chiefs controlled by the Saigon regime. Civil War In that same year, according to State Department publica- tions, N()rth Vietnamese infiltra- tion began. Yet the Johnson administration states that we are fighting because this is a clear case of one country trying to impose its government on an- other country. But it was orig- inally a civil war - there were never supposed to he two diff- erent countries. How, then, can one accept what has followed? Bennington College Dance Group Gives Enlightening Choreographic Performance By STEVEN COLE \Vords like fabulous, tremen- ·d()tUi, terrific, and brilliant can- ltd truthfully express the per- formance given by the Dance I>epartment of Bennington Col· lege on Tuesday night. ()fficially known as the 'ijen- nington College Dance Tour G-rl} up, the group presented a pErformance manifesting a clev- er .sense of professionalism, a u11ique technique, tremendous ·e~pression, and a true feeling for dance. The program began with a \Lecture-Demonstration\ b:y Martha Armstrong. Set to the tulle of a Beatles record, the deinonstration told how dance was becGming a recognized sense of expression in the same man- ner as one who plays the oboe or sings Mozart's \Dalla sua P4!coe.\ It was as if the group was giving us the recipe book for how one develops a dance; the way one walks and the way one falls was demonstrated ex\ trernely artistically. This gave tl::le audience the feeling that something unique was about to begin. Extreme discipline and tecll.nique were already laying tl::le. ground work Written and directed by jun- Jo..r Whittaker Sheppard, \Inci- dent At Dust\ was a dance con- cerned with one man's thoughts and emotions during the last in- stant of his life, Mr. Sheppard with the assistance of four fe- male dancers, displayed witll un- mistakably a:rtistry tb,e commun- ication of this lugubrious theme- Their bodies seemed to throb and to quiver and to quake as their expressions and hands told the story. One became amazed at the ultra~limberness of the composer. Although not a body of extraordinary physique like his co-dancers, Mr. Sheppard's danCing ability and his ability to write such a dance could only be applauded as fine in every sense. \A bird does not sing be- cause he has an answer. He singe because he has a song,\ by Joan Walsh Anglund was the theme of an original choreogra- phy by the very beautiful Wendy Perron.

Of the four Beatles songs Hord sang the blues of \Eleanor Rig- by\ and \Hello Goodbye,\ stand out. \Hello Goodbye\ was es- pecially well done, not in the traditional blues style. One of the added attractions was Diane Lawry from Skidmore who stepped on for a few num- bers. \And They Danced\ by Lawry was a fine song remini- cent of \Little Tin Soldier\ by Donovan. Her guitar work is very good and she created the interesting affect of a music box with harmonics. Her version of \To Try for the Sun\ was extremely appealing and be- lievable.

4 Rushing Revisited By LEN KAGAN The first of a two part series on the Rushing System· The views expressed here are the composite opinion of the fraternity rushing chairmen, as formulated at a meeting Mon- day night under the direction of IFC Rushing Chairman, Nick Dzebolo. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss present and future rushing rules. The result was the formulation of a revised rushing program, the de- tails of which now go before the entire IFC for discussion and possible enactment. day Smokers early in the rush- ing season. The two concepts were then blended together into a tentative plan that is similar to that used at numerous other schools. Thursday, .February l, 1968 HIPPIES DISCUSS.

Several sarcastic 1 e1111:tl'KS were heard when one boy · began combing another boy's ha1r. On the other hand, .Flank, attempting to dramatize h.s a.~Jenation from the political system, vemarked that the 1964 presidenttal election came down to a choice between Fascist A and Fascist B. Such extreme emotionalism was minimal, how- ever· One of the major items under consideration was the Bid Meal System which was generally felt to be rather ineffective. This often seemed to stem from a lack of interest among fresh- men who failed to appear at bid meals. The rushing chairmen felt that there was nothing to gain from assigning freshmen to visit a house in which they show- ed no interest, and recommend· ed that the system be dropped. It was suggested that the in- itial no-contact period be length- ened to approximately three weeks, giving freshmen more time to adjust to the coLege en- v.ronment. But during this per- iod each fraternity woulcj. be permitted to hold an Open House on the second or third Sunday after registration. This would permit freshmen to visit an of the fraternities if they were interested in doing so. Op- en Contact would begin on the following Friday. Another suggestion included abolishing the rule forbidding freshmen to visit fraternities on Homecoming until after 8 p.m. It was felt that each house should be permitted to decide for itself if it was feasible to entertain alumni and rush fresh- men simultaneously. Many of those present felt that alumni often make the best rushers since they show \another side of fraternity life.\ Faculty Members React to Speaker From the first time, Frank, the group's most att1cu1ate ULel•.- ber, spoke about artificial di- VISion created hy . the mass media between the hippie mov~­ meat and straight se>ctety.

One particularly interesting discussion occurred when one New Left-type student question- ed the hippies about their re- jection of society when there are so many over-riding prob- lems they could attempt to solve such as the war in Vietnam, poverty in the ghettoes, and star- vatlDn in India. Along the same vem, one professor accused the · hippies of egocentrism in con- cenu at1ng on tlle expansion of the self and full realization of the potent1al of oneself. Frank replied that when his friends spoke of self expansion they used the words self in its more mystical sense, almost in the same way the Zen Buddhists re- gard the se.f as an all embracing human condition.

These were the words of poli- tical science professor Robert Sharlet as he, Union Professor Charles Gati, and Dean Martin Lichterman addressed more than 100 Union students in a panel discussion commenting on re- cent guest speakers Henry Steele Commager and Harrison Salisbury.

The rapid frosh improvement was im.peded by an impressive Amherst five 76- 52, bringing Cbach Gary Brown's record to 3-4. The next frosh contest will be at Albany Phar- macy this Saturday. Against Hobart last Saturday the Garnet rolled to an impres- sive 87-61 victory which was -characterized by Co.ach Gary Brown as a \team effort\. This game marked the first time this season that the frosh were not outsized underneath. The result was an impressive performance off of the offensive and defen- sive boards. Center Bob Berger and forward Barry Fitzgerald were especially effective under- neath. Berger, who has taken up the rebounding responsibility, played a fine game, scoring 1:8 points to lead the Garnet, while rebounding and passing well around t})e basket. Many of his buckets came off passes from Dave Shames, who after a cool start popped 13 points in the first half. Shames finished with 17, sitting out half of the second half. The game was close until the waning moments of the first half, as the starting team of Berger, Fitzgerald, Jay Joseph, Shames and Guy Bartle enjoyed a slim lead. A brief scoring spurt by Shames and the in- spired play of John Margolis, coming off the bench shot the fFosh into a 13 point lead by half. This stretch was character- ized by a free wheeling fast break offense by the Garnet, and was culminated with a forty foot heave by Margolis at the buzzer for the last hoop before intermision. Key operatives in the first half were Joseph, and Fitzgerald; Jay scored all of his eight points in this period and Barry hit for 12 of his 14 .. In a futile effort to choke off the Garnet running game and close the margin, Hobart opened the second half in a zone press, switching from their man to man defense of the first half. The zone was completely ineff- L. G. BALFOUR CO.

Coach Brown cited the play of Mar- golis as especially effective in sparking the ball club. Coming off of strong wins against Williams and Hobart the Garnet were victimized by Amherst, 76-52. Coach Brown started the same five as in the Hobart contest, hoping he had found a winning combination. The Garnet opened in a man to man which was not overly effec- tive.

Vietnam Part 2 Page 3 Concordy Sports Hippies :Page 4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------·- - Cagers Top Hobart and Larries Before Amherst Loss Halts Skein The basketball team took two of three contests this week as they moved thei.J! record to 5-8 tor the season. Saturday they squeaked by Hobart 4:8-45 and Tuesday they scored their wid- est victory margin of the season as they bombed St. Lawrence 76-fn. However last night they fell victim to a poor second half and lost to Amherst 78-66. At Hobart the Garnet picked up an ICAC viCtory despite a horrible shooting night. Bill Nei- del with 12, and Craig Carlson with 10 led the ·offense, which connected on on'ly 29.3~-t from the field. Key to the victory over the Statesmen, who were previously 4~4, was the tough Garnet defense, which concen- trated on big point-makers Car- men Genovese and Terry Hat- maker, and held them to 14 each. with 30 seconds to go, and was also fouled. He missed the shot, leaving Union ahead by a scant point. Barry Katzman entered the contest for the attempt to freeze away the game, and sunk two from the lme to close out the scoring, Tuesday night in the field house the Garnet played their usual deliberate style of ball, but hopped 48% from the field, giving them their most convinc- ing victory of the campaign. A large part of the difference was the outstanding game .played by Tad Knight, who had been play- ing steady but unspectacular games through most of the sea- son. He led the scoring with 18, hitting nine of 10 from the field, and pulled down 10 re- bounds. Knight also made .sev- eral key assists, and played in- spired defense throughout. a spurt during which they out- scored the visitors 11-2, and staked themselves to a 49-43 lead halfway through the final stanza. Knight then provided the firepower for the Garnet to pour it on for the fil'st time all season, and win going away. Last night at Amherst the hoopsters fell victim .to a poor shooting second half, after lead- ing at intermission 39-31. At the half Bill Neidel and Tad Knight had staked the Garnet to a 17 for 29 shooting record from the field. The second half opened with the same pattern, and after four minutes Union led 49-40. The Ganet then managed only one field goal in twelve minutes as Amherst streaked to a 6tl-60 lead. The hosts then slowly pull- ed away before the helpless vis- itors. 81 points 'per game. The losing record is not indicative of the King's Point team, due to the calib-er of opposition. Three of the losses have come at the hands of Division II teams - H()fstra, Bridgeport and C. W. Post. The Mariners are led :by 6-3 junior forward Bob Hoffman, who was Division III sophomore . of the year in 1966-67 and is .averaging 21 points per game. The Mariners will play a tight man-to-man defense and will definitely give the Garnet trou- ble ()ll the boards. Player :of the Week Steve Werlin Steve Werlin's fast improve- ment in his specialty, the but- terfly, has been one of the strong points of the Z-1 swim- ming team, and has allowed him .. to take the honor of. \Player of 1' the. Week.\ Last Saturday in a .. losing cause, W erliJ!. broke his I own school mark with a clock- I ing of .2:12 for the 200•yard fly- i His previous record was 2:12.8, I which last year nearly qualified i .. him for the NCAA small-college· \, national meet. Earlier this sea- ' son he hadd triumphed twice ' with times of 2:30 and 2:24, and ! · this steady improvement gives( him a good chance to go to the , nationals, to be held during , 1\.iarch in Georgia. Steve is a 1 member of the medley re'lay team which is undefeated in· 1 three n.eets so far this season. l ! The deliberate Dutch offense waited for the good shots, but missed them in the first ha:lf and fell behind 25-17. After in- termission the story was differ- ent as Union managed a decent percentage, and slowly crept to within striking range of Hobart. It took them almost eighteen minutes, but the Garnet finally took the lead, 4li-43, on a hoop by Carlson, a cool character un- der pressure all season long. Neidel added a point from the line to give them a little breath- ing room, but Genovese took it right back with a driving layup Bill Neidel with 13 and Jeff Kirkpatrick with 10 completed the double-figure scoring against the Larries. N eidel led the scoring with 18, followed by Knight and Fitz Tuner with 16 and 11 vespective- ly, and also eight rebounds apiece. Union sank 26 of 54 from the field, as compared to the winners' 31-67. Switntners Succutnb, 57-38; ,; The early stages of the con- test were similar to the first half at Hobart. The Dutchmen were cold, and were allowing the Larries too many offensive rebounds. The visitors tniiled 20-14: at the ten-minute mark. As the offense picked up some- what, Union cut the lead down to 33-31 at intermission. K-P Here Sat. W erlin Shatters.· Fly Record The second half saw the Gar- net shooting finally come alive. With St. Lawrence leading by four, Schmid's charges went on Another high-scoring, fast- breaking ball club, the Mariners of King's Point, come to the Fieldhouse Saturday night. The Mariners are currently sporting a 5-8 record averaging After an impressive win last week against Hobart, the Garnet Varsity swimmers suffered a 57- 38 setback at the hands of Wil- liams Saturday. The Garnet mermen now stand at 2-1 for the season. 4-0 Mattnen Overwhelnt Hobart The Union squad looked good as they led off the afternoon with an impressive win in the 400 yard medley relay in which the team of F·red Fagel, Norm Dovberg, Steve W erlin, and Kevin Hobin chopped 5 seconds off their winning time against Hobart to win in 4:12.2. How- ever. after that, the Union swim- mers could muster only three more firsts and a handful of sec- onds and thirds. Look To Rochester SaturdaJ-~ \A tough, sharp squad .. · one that makes very few mis- takes . . . \ was the way coach Ron Coleman described his 1968 Garnet wrestling team, follow- ing its 26-9 rout of a fine Hobart squad Saturday. The grapplers now sport a 4-0 season record, and look to be every bit as good as last year's outstanding 8-1 aggregation. With the seas<ln nearing the half-way mark, Garnet grapplers have now lost only seven in- dividual matches, while winning 21 conte$ts, fourteen of them by pins. In' addition, the Garnet have picked up four matches on forfeits ~Y their opponents. The grapplers have thus rolled up an impressive 131 total points, while yielding only 25. ln Saturday's match in Alum- ni Gym, Bill Munno easily won his 123 match to begin the Gar- net triumph, as :he scored a 7-0 victory. Frank D'Antuono, in Coleman's words, \really did a job\ as he pinned a tough 130 Hobart foe in 2:40. Frank, still recovering from a shoulder in- jury, looked to be returning to top form as he recovered from a 2-0 first-period deficit. Ron Ian- notti, who scored a thirty-second pin against Dartmouth, led ~11 the way before he once agam pinned his foe, taking his 137 contest in 4:31. Tom Tripp won his 145 match, by forfeit, giving the Garnet an 18-0 lead at that point. Once again, the grapplers lost 152 and 160 contests to tough opponents. Leigh Frye, who lost a well- fought 160 contest in the Dart- mouth match, was the victim of a 9-3 decision in the 152 class. Jeff Knetzer fell behind early in his 160 match and lost by a 16-5 c.ount. Once again, however, Nay- sim. Simon turned the tables back in favor of the Garnet by taking his 167 match.

Noted M:inority Rights Leader Beat Poet-Hippie Presen~ts Four Union students have been notified that they will receive Wo<ld- row Wilson Fellowship or will be designated Honorary Wilson FelloVIS. has etten stirred Co·ntroversy Contemporary Views and Poetry Joel Rubenzahl, a Physies major from Neversink, N.Y.; Martin Stros- berg, a Political Science major fl.-om Troy; Benjamin Volinski, an English major of Southhold, N.Y.; and Kent Kraft, English major of Sparrowbllsh, N.Y., were those students notified. Radical civil rights leader Saul Alin- sky will speak in Memorial Chapel to· night, and· controversial poet AHen Ginsberg wm appear next Tuesday as the next two speakers in Union's Convocation schedule. Alinsky, who wiU speak on the \Democratic Dilemma\ has been or· ganizing minority groups in America for the past twenty-five years. Re- cently he has turned his attention to the Negro community but his experi· ence includes work with Mexican- Americans, Poles, Lithuanians and Italians. When he arrives in areas of urban blight, an article in the \Economist\ reports, the press, political and busi- ness leaders and others begin to both attaek him and apply pressure to local middle elass Negroes to denounce him. When he and his staff leave an area, local leaders have been able to continue on their own - something less radical civil rights leaders have been unable to accomplish. Negro groups have been especially impressed by the ~ains of Chicago's Woodlawn commumty, organized by Alinsky and now operating on its own. Poor Lack Status Alinsky believes that men with power try to retain their power and. generally try to increase it. The poor, on the other hand, lack money and status and must rely on harnessing other resources, numbers and discip- line. In the past, Alinsky has attacked slum landlords by sending negro ten· ants to picket the owners' exclusive suburban houses. He is about to shift his focus and enter the field of edu- cation in a formal way. Backed by several church groups, he is launch· ing a school to train community or- ganizers. A 14-month course, it will be attached to one of the universities in the San Francisco area. Work projects in surrounding communities will be included as part of the academic program. Allen Ginsberg, whose controversial stance on Viet Nam and .the use of drugs, have made him the most pub- licized .poet of the day will speak on \the Poetry of Allen Ginsberg.\ Finds LSD Expanding Ginsberg approves of LSD because he has used it and has found it a preferred method of obtaining new and different experiences. He sees the drug as a valid mind-expanding cata- lyst. Of LSD and marijuana, be says he rarely uses them but believes that \if I want to take them, I should have the right to.\ He is author of three complete vol- umes ·of poetry and other additional poems which have appeared in maga- zines. His work has been translated into Italian, German, French, Spanish, Czech, Russian, Japanese and Hindu. Random House to Pub!ish So much emphasis is placed on his involvement in civil rights and other \causes\, that his actual poetry and writing seem to have become almost secondary. However, Ginsberg is al- ways writing; and a significant chapter in his career came to a climax re- cently when he decided to allow Ran- dom House to publish a :volume of his essays, marking the first time a highly respected publishing house will issue his work. In the past his pub- lisher had been a small West Coast concern headed by a personal friend.

Several fraternity presidents con- cluded an hour-long Inter-Fraternity Council meeting Tuesday evening with plans of closing fraternity parties for good. Martin to Speak The motion was expected to be re- moved from the table this afternoon following a talk by President Martin. The proposal is a policy statement calling for closed parties at Union and provides for a card system to enforce the rule. ('' Today's meeting was seheduled for 4:30 p.m. in Hale House Student Lounge. Olton on Drugs An IFC represetnative said the mo- tion closing parties would have passed Tuesday if today's meeting had not already been scheduled. Nick: Dzebolo, President of Sigma Chi and IFC rushing chairman, made Tuesday's proposal following a talk by Dean of Students Charles Olton on campus drug use and fraternities in general. The meeting was held in the Alpha Delta Phi chapter house. The proposal calls for the issuance of IFC cards to every fraternity mem- ber. The name of a fraternity will be designated on each card. Dzebol.o said the cards would enable individual houses to decide who they wili allow at a party. No Parties? Dzebolo said he hopes the motion will pass today so the proposed rule may be put into effect by Winter Weekend beginning Feb. 16. Some IFC representatives indicated they expected President Martin t() comment on the proposed rule at today's meeting. The President told ConC!()rdiensiS\o Wednesday that he does not intend to interfere with the IFC. He said the meeting today \is to open some lines of communication on the gen- eral role of fraternities.\ Too Rowdy As for the closed-party proposal, \this is a matter for their own gov- ernance,\ the President added. Dzebolo's motion followed a state- ment by Dean Olton relaying Presi- dent Martin's concern about the na- ture of fraternity parties at Uni<>n. The Dean said parties are ~'T<Jo rowdy.\ \We don't expect you to substlttde afternoon tea parties for beer parties.\ The Dean said, but added tb.at \Union men don't appear to be able to hold their liquor.\ Frat Raid The Dean also warned against drug use on campus, specifically in fra- ternity houses, and reminded b.ot1se presidents of the recent raid 011. the. New York State University at Stony Brook. Dean Olton commented that the problem appears not to have reached any major proportions, but empha- sized that the administration has re- ceived information that there is some use of marajuana on campus. He added that a fraternity is re- sponsible for the actions of its mem- bers within the chapter house, urging house presidents to discourage the liSe of drugs by its members. joined the Union faculty in 1958.

Education program pro- posed in a report from the Curricular Affairs Committee issued two weeks age, were approved by the Faculty at a meeting held last Friday. The most noticeable change in the present CED program is the revision of the Junior year offerings. Prev- iously, a junior merely eleeted two CED options outside his center to fulfill his year's requirement. Under the new program, the junior year courses \shall consist of a proj- ect course examining a problem re1e- vant to contemporary life off-campus, to to non-curricular life on campus. Students will join in six-man teams for two consecutive terms. During the first term, students will do field re- search on their problem, and during the second term, the three six-man teams working under one instructor will participate in a seminar\ to re- view the import of their studies as outlined in written reports.\ The senior year program will also be modified. Seniors will elect one of four courses \directed toward p1·o bing unsettled philosophical questions in different general fields of study, and will also choose one regular OJJtion outside their center. The freshman and sophomore year programs will stay about the same as they are now. The recent revisions did, however, provide that certain courses in a center may be desig- nated as acceptable options. for sttt- dents in that same center. It was also required that \no more than two options may be chosen fr<>m among those offered by the factllty of one department,\ and that the Corhp. Ed. Board, which approves op- tions, \may also approve limited num· ber of regular departmental C()Urses as acceptable substitutes for Ot>tions. ~ored by the conference of engineer- Ing educators.

The. fotlr senioz:s will ~e no~ified by Apnl 15th which des1gnatwn they will receive. Last year, Union also had four- Woodrow Wilson winners and three seniors who received hon· orable mention. Council Acts In Favor of No Action The Student Council voted down a proposal to consider taking a policy position on the Vietnam War at its meeting Monday night. It also 'elected to maintain the present system of re- quired convocation attendence. Petition Circu:ated The petition which was circulated among Student Council members for the purpose of deciding whether or not to debate the Vietnamese situa- tion said: \The war in Vietnam per- tains directly to every American, but more specifically it bears immediate influence on men of our age. All political bias aside, the Vietnam war is an issue with which each of us must ccme to terms because it is a war that involves so much more than a military struggle between the ag- gressor and the aggressed. Since stu- dents can no longer evade the draft and are no longer able to avoid the situation, they are being forced to investigate the issues that suddenly invo~ve them personally. And since the. Individuals who compromise the Umon College community are vitally interested and affected by Vietnam it is highly important that the Stu~ dent C()uncil recognize this fact. \1) Should the Student Couneil members discuss and make known their opinions on the position of the United States in VietNam? (The vote on this question was; 9 votes in favor and 13 votes against.) \2) Should a majority opinion be polled it should read as: The Stu- dent Council of Union College finds • . . ( 7 votes in favor and 15 votes against.) \ Convo Debate After a considerable debate in which several members came ' out strongly in favor of recommending the abolishment of compulsory convo- cations. The Couneil voted to main· tain the present system. A committee was appointed to look into the matter and to. report to the Council on the whole to.pic at the next meeting. The vote was 14 in favor of maintaining the present system and 11 against.

Comprehensive Education Subject Of Praise, Disgust And Discussion 1.. P.M. Pike· s Reasons By STEVEN COLE \The basic pl'oblem with the Comp. Ed. program is, first of all, that an impressive course structure .produces only impressively structured (ourses not academic excellent and distinc- tion\ was the statement found in the editorial for the February 1 editi()n of the Concordiensis. Union students have been reacting in various man- ners to the controversial issue of what some students call \incompetent ed.\ and what others call \not a bad i<lea.\ doing any reading assignments. He classified it as a \gut.\ Orients Students specific professors make a course \good or bad\. For example, \Comp. Ed. 10 with Prof. Shinagel has been interesting and the practice in writing . has been the most useful part.\ One ! student stated. He continued by say- ing that the course 1 \is useful but the stigma of a 'required course' hurts it. The class size often hurts.\ Prof. . Terry's Comp. Ed. 43: The Politics of ' Poverty was referred to as a course that was \killed\ by size - 139 stu- dents! Take the Dive Olton explained that Bishop Pike sent a pErsonal letter giving the rea- sons for- cancelling his lecture. Be- cause this controversial figure had been un<ier heresy charges, he had left his post as Bishop of Northern California and joined the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. At the same time he began touring the country to present his case to the public. It was during this period that Olton contacted the Bishop. However when Pike was exonerated of his charges, the Center required him to be present at their meetings. He was then forced to cancel all of his speak· ing engagements. Hans 1\Iorgenthau is familiar to many Union students as the author Rabbi Samuel Sandmel's lecture should be of great interest acccrding to Prof. Nol\man Johnson, who ar- ranged the convocation, because this scholar's field of study is the period of early Christian development. Books by the speaker include: A Jewish Understanding of the New Testament; The Genius of Paul; We J'ews and Jesus; llemd: Profile of a Tyrant; We Jews and Yo11 Christians. \On paper, the idea of a general course is a good one, but it fails in practice\ was an opinion .given by a freshman who had had two <!ourses in the program. The student felt the course did nothing more than t() give practice in writing term papers. The particular course discussed was Scien- tific Concepts, a freshman compre- hensive education course. The student gave an example of how the concept of generality was meaningless, \We took two days and went into depth about detailed mathematical analysis of theories.\ The student said tllat he had gotten out oi the ccurse without In contrast to the above statements, one student said: \The Comprehen· sive Education Program here at Union leaves much to be desired according to some important people on campus, but I .feel that the program does more good than harmJ especially for .fresh- men. College lite seems to be some- thing ominous to incoming freshmen especially the intellectual end of it. Concerning this aspect of college life, the Comp. Ed. program serves the same purpose that the orientation period serves in .acquainting fresh- men with the college. It ten<ls to be a class in which no intensive work must be done, but comprehension of abstract concepts is a must and this is a good way of setting the fresh· man's mind in motion once again, and familiarizing the freshmen with the intellectual purs1,1it at Uni()n. For these two reasons, I think that com- prehensive education is worthwhile and should not b~ abandoned.\ Some students commented that Nott Scholar Paul Beal said, \Pro- fessors and students alike are missing · an opportunity .to take advantage of an extremely liberal structure sim- ply because they lack self-control and because they refuse to exercise the diligent reequisite to their respective positions.

Rushing: Frosh Views lly STEPHEN WALL No single cause can be given to ex- .plain why nearly half of the students of the class of 1971 decided not to join fraternities. The decision for each man was intensely personal. The fol- lowing are responses to the question: ··why didn't you join a fraternity?\ Mike Williams, a Sociology major from Long Island City, stated quite simply, \l do not see anything that fraternities have to offer me.\ Different Reasons Another student commented: \My father did not think I should join a fraternity, at least until my grades have improved. Anyway, the new col- lege dormitories are far superior to fraternity houses.\ :By BILL COLUCCI It has been rumored that a :pledge is not th.e most impressive life form to llte: found on the Union college campus. Some fraternity men have gone- :so far as to compare a .pledge's stattue to that of an Amoeba. Tl».is, too, lacks scientific substan· tiation. Objective Status Nevertheless, this pledge, by virtue of Ids unique semi-fraternity. semi· inde(Jendent status, is one somce of objective opinion on fraternity life. It was for one of two torpedoes, then, that the Administration eight hours after the \attack\ ordered re- taliatory bombing strikes, the first of their kind,. against North Vietnam. Congressional approval was equally swift and decisive: Congress voted through overwhelmingly a resolution endorsing \all necessary measures\ taken by the Administration to pre- vent further aggression. The air war against North Vietnam had begun. From the Tonkin resolution to the present the Vietnam war has escalated uncontrollably to monumental propor- tions. In July of 1965 American troops reached 125000 1 in number; In June Nguyen Cao Ky became Premier of the shaky South Vietnamese gov- ernment where he remained until' last September. Winter Weekend entertainment, Soul Survivors rehearse for their performance in Memorial Chapel. Tickets are on sale in all resident units at $2.25 per person. Other students had wanted to join fraternities but had been rejected. \They didn't choose me,\ a freshman said. Evidently the independent fresh· men tended to fall into two groups. There were those who were disap- pointed in not being selected and those who decided that the less re- stricted life of an independent was more appealing. In the two weeks which have elap- sed si11ce Pledge Night '68, over half of Union's freshmen have received thei~ first t.aste of fraternity life. Varied Reactions ,CAMPUS NEWS AND NOTICES :Pew Benefits One student put his decision into these words: InwariaiJly, some were disillusioned others were pleasantly surprised. The majo•tiity, however, found what they had been led to expect :£rom their rushing experiences. By June of 1966 American forces numbered at 267,000; one year ago they were up to 350;000, now they have reached 525;000- Losses have risen proportionately. In June, 1966, the U.S. took a major step in escalat- ing the war by bombing for the first time the Demilitarized Zone and fuel storage installations near Hanoi and Haiphong. McNamara explained the move as an attempt to reduce com- munist infiltration from the North; he has since then admitted that, and last week's events attest to the fact that infiltration has not been slowed. Meanwhile disillusionment over the war continues to increase measurably both in the U.S. and Vietnam.

Cor11erback The energy, dedication, and insight of the authors of Linebackei' are in tte healtl:iest tradition of student activ- ism and we find their initiative a pleasant addition to the Union scene. Beyond the scope of tl:e information it contains, with its admitted limited accuracy, the rEsponses and reactions of the various elements of the college community to Line- backer will reveal as never before whatever selfishness, apathy, or inefficacy exists here. The sense of the Student Council has been to under- take to continue the presentation of a course evaluation. W:b..ether it recognizes the fact or not, the Council's publica- tion must he able to surpass the first issue of Linebacker in promptness, student response, and comprehensiveness ; it would indeed be a black mark against the Student Coun .. cil if its prestige could not elicit considerably more student participation than the first ,effort of a few sophomores operating on their own. With its larger resources of per- sonnel, their final critique should appear sooner after the poll is conducted. The judgement and perspective of the authors of the initial volume excelled to the point where any other group will be fortunate to match it, and therefore is another tacit challenge to their followers. But how did US. involvement ,proliferate to such incredible :proportions? How did Ameri- ca become so hopelessly em- broiled in the pointless, bloody and often embarrassing con- flict? The origin of communism in 'South Vietnam holds the an- swers to these questions, at least from the Administration's :point of view. Viet Con9 Emerge At this point, in 1961, Amer- ican influence in South Viet- nam was limited to between two and four thousand military ad- visors and substantial economic aid only. Their purpose was to instruct South Vietnamese how to com- hat Viet Cong guerillas who recently had organized the Na- tional Liberation Front. Meanwhile internal strife was brewing which had nothing to do with communism. South Any faculty member wl:o learns anything from Line- b~cker should se;;-iously question more than his pe::lagogic technique. Avenues of feedback from students are wide and varied. Perhaps superior to informal discussion are the highly directed and highly specific course evaluation of the type distributed by Prof. Olton, Potts, and Shulet last term. In attempting to apply to all courses and limiting much of its format to multiple choice, even an all-pro I LETT,D ns Linebacll:N' could never be as meaningful to an instrudor .L!J.fl.. as an evaluation form that was personally designed.

No, rerhaps it is better said that the council has not done it again. Con· sistent with its policy of non-involvement in campl!S affairs, the Council, at its meeting Monday night, spurned two valuable opportunities to promote student interests and stimulate campus debate. Student discontent with the present system of re- quired convocations is well known. The council's refusal to take a firm stand in favor of abolishing the convocation at- tendance requirement illustrates how far remov-ed the council is from the mainstream of student opinion. A faculty member commented that ''even we could have done bett-er than that.\ The council also refused a proposal to entertain debate within itself on the Vietnam war for purposes of taking some kind of stand on that issue. It would seem that the council is afraid of- ~reas of controversy which might re· sult in differences o-'f,.opinion. If the Council is afraid of its own variety, it is also afraid of its own vitality (which seems to be well hidden at the present) and will never be a leader and mobilizer of student opinions and interests. recommendations, in my experi- ence of them, have never been questioned on grounds of atti- tude toward this or any other proposal. It is a popular pas- time now for some students to !ook for conspiracies in the academy and to invent what they cannot discover· You do no one a service by giving countenance to or encouraging that spirit. Jlarold C. Martin President Editor's Note: The significance ()f the charges made by certain faculty members lies, not in the charges themselves, but the acute manner that they point out the depth to whicll faculty morale has faUen, and the mis· trust of the administration that has been caused by this whole Comp. Ed. affair. DIAMANTE'S Union does not need a Student Council that is content to be a social club. The present Council better represents the administration than it does the student body. The ad- ministration, we might point out, is quite well represented on campus and needs no help from the Student Council. : · If the Council can not better justify its existence in the ' future than it has in the past, it might as well just quietly ·• fade away. At present, such an occurence would be no' great loss. Enjoy Our Fine Home Cooked Italian Food in Our Comfortetble Dining Room Opp. The Brownell Gate on Nott Street Open Daily I 0 to 1 A.M. Sundays 5 P.M. to 1 A.M. Vietnamese were growing in- creasing:y irritated with, and as a result more outspoken against the Diem regime. In November of 1960 South Viet- namese military forces, with increased public exacerbation over the repressive, dictatorial conditions of Diem's rule, had surrounded the Presidential pal- ace and forced Diem to promise reforms. Buddh isr Protests Two years later the reforms still had not come. In May, 1!;63, government troops attacked Buddhists whG were demonstrating in Hue over the governrr.ent's denial of the Buddhists' right to fly their re- ligious f:ag. Buddhist monks retaliated with protest self-im- mo 1 ations. J;n August secret rolice raided and smashed sev- eral Buddhist pagodas; mass ar- rests of protesting Buddhist monks, high school and college students followed. Something in the government had to give, and on the first day of November a coup over- threw the South Vietnamese government with relative ease, ousting Diem and his advisors, one of which was his brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu. Diem and Nhu were initially reported to have corrmitted suicide; a day later their executions were made pub- lic. Madame Nhu, widowed wife of the Premier's brother, charg- ed the U.S. with taking an ac- tive role in the coup, alleging it could not have succeeded without American aid. Ameri- can officials denied any U.S. participation in the coup, but Diem's former inability to sat- isfy Washington and President Kennedy's recent public denunc- iation of the Premier led to the general worldwide assump- tion that the U.S. had been active in inciting and carrying through the takeover. In Diem's place was Nguyen Ngoc Tho, Premier of the pro- visional government. Follow- ing his promises to \intensify the struggle against the Viet- cong\ the U.S. announced that it welcomed the coup and would continue its present aid pro- gram. Tho's military junta lasted three months. It had hardly had time to begin intensifying the struggle before Maj. Gen. Nguyen Khanh deposed it. His reasons for the action: dissatis- faction over the junta's conduct of the war. The ousting oc- curred on January 29, 1964; Khanh was to guide the South Vietnamese government for nine months before the command again changed hands. U.S. Build-up Continues During this internal strife American military build-up con- tinued. By November 1£63 U.S. military advisors numbered 16,- 500; U.S. spending was estimat- ed at over $400 million a year.

What accomplishments have .been made in these fields? What are their goals? What can be done to improve them? And finally (and this is up to the reader to decide for himself), is tltere a true Renaissance of the Arts at Union? Unl.-ss s oe(ificaUy quoted, all opinions in the at ticks are those uf the authors. MUSIC By CLIFFORD SAFANE Color the Union music scene foggy. The art has shown a lot 0f promise and potential, 'but seems to be lacking a motivating force. Of all of Union's musical groups, the Glee Club is probably the best known. Professor Wilson has done a fine job with the group . and ·has molded it into a good singing unit. The Glee Club's concert with Marymount College at Union two weeks ago is an example of the group's :fine work. The North Eastern Student Orchestra, Wood- wind Quintet, and Brass Choir take care .of the classical music on this campus. I haven't heard these groups this, but last year, I was quite im- pressed with the Orchestra. Professor Curtis has done a marvelous job and has come up with a good student orchestra. Big Band and a half years here. The Administration is slowly starting to push the Arts. But things are moving too slowly. The plans have been layed, but what we need is action, not talk. THEATRE By HARRY MILLER On the evening of George Washington's birth- day, 1887, a minstral ,performance was given \for the benefit of the athletic and baseball in- terests .of the college.\ That performance marked the first appearance of dramatic endeavor at Union. Drama at Union today is a student activity in which student participation has been increas- ingly enthusiastic. But to realize its potential, this enthusiasm must have adequate outlets in accord with the demands of contemporary theatre. The role of the arts at Union or any other liberal arts college in regards to the academic discipline is a c0nfusing point. Mr. William L. Meriwether, Instructor of Drama and Director of the Theatre, feels that the first commitment to the drama courses and productions in a liberal arts college should be to drama as an art form. \Drama is about man in the dimension of his human capac- ities. The arts ,are the only way we study this large part of life. The arts are a significant ap- proach :to understanding what human experience is; what being alive is.\ be a great step forward. The number of courses available could be increased as well as the number of productions. f>erhaps there could be a major in theatre. Currently drama is part of the fine arts major and the least emphasized of the three components of this major: art, music, and of course, drama. Drama courses, now, can be ap- plied to the EngHsh major, although this fact is omitted in the Academic Register. Environment Important A good performance depends a great deal upon the environment within which it is pre- sented. The theatre-in•the-round in Nott Memorial is the center of dramatic activity at Union. In such a theatre, \the major technical element is lighting,\ says Mr. Meriwether. \Here we have had tremendous improvement by adding an over- head lighting grid last year, which was designed by Professor Anthony Hoadley. When I came here there were only four Lighting bars; we now have lighting bars all around the balcony. We stiU need more lighting instruments. We have enough instruments to minimally light the stage, but we cannot sufficiently control the lightin~. We are supposed to get a dimmer board. With this we'll be in pretty good technical shape.\ We have recently secured a theatre consult- ant, W. Oran Parker, head of the design program at Carnegie Tech. He has made a report on the future and present needs of the theatre at Union. This report has not yet been released. Mr. Meriwether a!so would like to see as movie.\ But, while the Workshop does sponsor and present the popular full-length motion pic· tu-res which have been shown on campus this year, that is just one .facet of its entire program. The Film Workshop is composed of about 15 Union students interested in filmmaking either as a hobby or career. Most of the members are currently in some sort of filmmaking, working on slide shows, film decurnentaries or two-to-three minute film shorts on vaded topics. \We've had a number of ideas for films submitted,\ Bob Thurber, a senior member of the Workshop, said in a Concordiensis interview. Thurber, who is working on a personal film portfolio for his independent study in filmmaking this term and hopes to do graduate work in film. making, said that the W()rkshep plans to have two or three 20-to-30 minute long films and several film shorts ready \sometime in the spring.'' Film Festival \We hope to show the films on campus and maybe enter one or two in the student film festivals in the area,\ Thurber said. He and junior John Shephard are presently working on a film of a kindergarten in Cambridge, N.Y. The Workshop uses 8-milimeter cameras which Union purchased in conjunction with the Upward Bound program last summer. This spring the group has plans to shoot dramatic films using student-written scJ1ipts and students as ac- tors and directors. The Workshop has set up an editing room in Old Chapel. The Jazz Workshop may he ready to make its move. Last year, it was its excellent quintet which held it together. But this year, the big band is starting to make some noise (no pun intended). I dori't especially like big band jazz~ but I have to admit that the band has improved quite a bit. It has a ways to go, but has had a good start. The Arts at Union The Workshop del'ives its funds from the Student Tax Committee, which recently alloted $975 to the activity for the term, and the W. C. Fields and American Film Academy productions. The Fields movies are rented directly from a distributor in New York City. But the small groups are, as always, the Workshop's strength. This year there is a new quintet, plus a trio. And both groups are playing good jazz. So much for the groups. The big question is what has been done for music on this campus and what can be done? The Arts Center which College has proposed is an excellent idea. I'm glad that the College is starting to realize that the Arts are important; but they must do more than talk The Arts Center should be started soon. I know that the College lacks money, but why not build the Center before overhauling the Sciences? After all, we have space for the Sci- ences on campus, and no place for the Arts. Hinderance The Admissions Department is a tremendous hindrance to music at Union. A good orchestra or jazz group can't be made if good instrumen- talists can't be had. Union has some very good musicians, but they are few and far between. We lack depth. The College should go out and rec:ruit students with strong music backgrounds, or else we will never get the players necessary to have top groups. More student concerts should be held. Ad- mittedly, Union's present facilities aren't very good. Memorial Chapel's accoustics are lacking and the building itself has the intimacy of Yankee Stadium. As for the Rathskeller, at first glance it looks like an excellent place to perform. llut what performer wants to hear someone scream out \one cheeseburger\ in the middle of his solo? But things can be done. The North End Coffee House is an excellent idea and has been working. Its success shows that there is an audi- ence for good music on this campus. Nott Memorial is a good place for conce:rts; but a piano is needed. The music room in the Humanities Building isn't too had a spot either. Overworked What else should be done? Well, the music faculty should be increased immediately. Pro- fessors Curtis and Wilson are both excellent men. But they are overworked. They need help. And the College should help them. A larger staff would allow more students to take music courses. And then, perhaps attendance at student concerts would increase; and maybe we would develop more musicians. Thus, the music scene at Union is mixed. Things have improved considerably in my two Mr. Meriwether suggests a bolstering in the curriculum. \We do need a method for develop- ing the talents of student actors, directors, and playwrights. We do not need a program oriented towards professional theatre. There is a great deal of justified resistance to this type of pro- gram. However our experiments with the theatre workshops are attempts to find alternative means of developing student talents.\ \I would like to see drama taught in a way similar to Professor Bittleman's studio courses. He combines the learning process with the aesthe- tic and practical aspects of art. He is not trying to turn out artists but to teach about art through the creative process. I would like to see this done in drama. I think that it can be done, and our theatre workshops are a good beginning.\ What is the interest in Drama at Union? According to Mike Halperson, president of the Mountebanks, 30 to 40 students participate in every production, on-stage and back-stage. The nationwide figure for student body attendance at a dramatic performance is 10%. We surpass that substantially. \The nature of students' interest has changed considerably. It has become more academic; it is an extracurricular activity which is becoming more curricular \ stated Halperson. Certainly the Mountebanks have played a major role in the development of drama at Union- The Mountebanks are the produc- ing organization of the theatre. They take care of properties, make-up, costumes and the technical areas of the stage. Without them there would be no means of mounting a production. The essence of drama at Union is, of course, the students. What of the backbone, the source of raw materials for production? In the opinion of Mr. Meriwether, the administration has delivered a good deal of support to dramatics at Union. In the past there had been only two courses re- lated to drama, given in alternate years, two productions a year, and a teacher whose time was divided between drama and speech. There are now six courses in the Academic Register, a workshop, and a full-time teacher. There are also three faculty assistants on a grant-in-aid arrange- ment. The administration has expressed a desire to see drama grow at Union, but with out con- siderable allocation of funds, little more can be done. Another full-time faculty member would Lt\ SEMESTER IN ENGLAND L. G. BALFOUR CO. At Wroxton College for Juniors ~nd Seniors Live and study in Lord North's ancestral Abbey, upda~ed a:r:d heated.

We do not need to be limited to conventional proscenium theatre, especially when so much is being written for unconventional theatre.\ Long Range Plans On the administration's calendar the Science and Engineering Building and the Student Union have priority. Long range plans for the theatre have been proposed; but there are no additions slated for drama in the immediate future ac- cording to Dean Lockwood. While the eiltire needs of drama cannot be provided for en masse piecemeal improvements are possible in th~ present. Suggestions have been made that Anti- och students be hired to run the technical areas of the stage in order to allow the faculty member to concentrate on the basic aspects of production. Other possibilities should be explored. \Drama is growing at a very healthy rate at Union,\ stated Mr. Meriwether. \Students are involved in a good way. The program has been growing considerably in the last four years, and it is continuing at a steady rate. Most of the stu- dents involved in drama are not going to elect drama as their profession. It is a part of their education.\ This term a bill of three one-act plays are to be presented, two of which are under the direc- tion of Mr. Martin Mann. \Robert's Civil War,\ by L. B.

Fields --- - -·--- ~-- The AF A films, however, are distributed throughout the area t<J (lo]Jege groups interested in showing them on campus. The small, newly- organized group rents the films for one month, then sub-lets them to C()i'!ege organizations. Skid- more and SUNY at Albany are among several other campuses besides Union which subscribe to the AFA. The Workshop has made over $150 so far on the AF A ventures. lncreasin g Interest From the filmmaking point of view, the Workshop cannot be Justly criticized as of yet. The members are enthusiastic and willing to de- vote the time and effort necessary to produce quality material; this spring will witness whether or not that time and effort has paid off when the Workshop shows its films on campus. In any event, it is apparent that the Workshop is a small but active organization of dedicated stu- dents, a claim which not every campus group can truthfully make. For its first year in full-time operation, the Film Workshop has ac:hieved a surprising fol- lowing and measure of success. Last week's Time fully explored the campus revolution in film- making; while interest at Union in filmmaking may not be as marked as one some college campuses, interest in worthwhile films is notable. One Workshop member }Jointed out that A Taste of Honey, a lesser kno,vn but nevertheless su- perbly executed film, drew less of an audience than the more renowned Fields presentations; this is undoubtedly due to the as of yet not fully developed interest at Union in films and the film industry. But its affiliation with the AF A has proven a lucrative venture for the Workshop, and its members are to be congratulated for undertaking the experim_ent. ~EWEST LU~CH 7:1..5 Albany Street Specializing: - HOT DOGS WITH FAMOUS SAUCE - DINNERS AND SANDWICHES - lAKE-OUT ORDERS - Union Students Favorite Spot - (Serving Schenectady Since 1921) M.AL DOMINY BS:EE, Union, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Teaneck, New Jersey 07666 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~;;;;~--~-~-~-JE~~~-~-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~ ______ .... there's one place that does it!

Hoop-view . \ e C()ntinued from Page 8 were never really strong and, with center Art Delusky aca- demically ineligible for the sec- ond term, their rebounding is a big question mark. The an- swer to that question will rest with Delusky's replacement, 6'5\ sophomore Tom Nardi who has enough ability but lacks con- siderable polish as a ball hand- ler. Although he played only in spots, Nardi has managed to accumulate a 4.8 rebounds per game average and, interestingly enough, is a good shooter as well, hitting 56 per cent of his shots. The Engineers make up for these weaknesses, however, with a far better shooting per- centage than Union has shown this season. 6'4'' forward Pete Vanderzee, a sophomore and the team's leading scorer with a 16 point average, has only one bad night all season (4-14 versus Hobart). Except for that night he has been hitting 51% of his shots from the floor and 86% from the foul line. The rest of the team does nearly as well; guard Chick Matties hits 43% from the floor and has a 14 point average; Ferguson, 40% and 11 points; and Kramer, 43% and 11 points. Vietnam War ••• Continued from Page 3 Vietnamese elections last Sep- tember, Truong Dinh Dzu, the peace candidate, finished a sur- prising close second with 800,- 000 votes. The Administration is torn over the issue, both in Congress and the Presidency. McNamara and Gardner both resigned due largely to Johnson's adamancy over the war, U.N. Ambassador Arthur Goldberg and Treasury Secretary Henry Fowler are rumored next. In the Vietnam- ese government the situation is no better: Maj. Gen. Nguyen Dug Thang, head of South Viet- nam's pacification program, re- signed last Saturday because he saw no hope of success for the program. British newspa- pers have reported that in view of the recent uprisings in South Vietnam, Westmoreland may be relieved of his command for his faulty handling of the war. As far as negotiations are con- cerned, the general consensus is that they were made further improbable by last week's events; at present Thieu's pol- icy is one of non-recognition of the Viet Cong, making negotia- tions with them even more un- likely. Newly appointed Sec- retary of Defense Clark Gifford has made it clear that the bombing will not be halted; at the same time Communist China's policy remains one of promised armed military assist- ance to North Vietnam if it is invaded. And the North Vietnamese remain immovable in their fight against the U.S. As the New York Times pointed out in an editorial last week, the recent ' guerilla raids \are not deeds of an enemy whose fighting deficiency has 'progressively de- clined' and whose morale is 'sinking fast' as United States military officials put it in No- vember.\ For Americans, the three year war in Vietnam is starting to drag; for South Viet- namese, the thousand year war drags on. RPI Wrestling Preview •••• . .. victorious last year, is 2-2 in 1967\68 while Yelton, recover-- ing from an injury, is 3-0. Two strong wrestlers in the Garnet's Naysim Simon and the Engi- neers' Marc Abranovic meet head-on at 167 pounds. Simon, a sophomore, is undefeated· at Union in two years, while Al>- ranovic, 1-1 in 67-68, was IC.AC champ last year at 177. The 177 and !91 pound classes Will be contested for the Garnet by 4-1 Barry Cornwall and 1-1 Ken Merz- Two out of the trio ()f Dave Found, Larry Rogers, and Joe Slavino will represent the Engineers at these classes. Only Found has seen action this year, and has a 2-2 mark. At the heavyweight class, Larry Felix of RPI brings a 2-1-1 record against the Garnet's Frank Fu- sick, who is 3-1. Union Strength A quick overview of the matches shows that Union's strength in the five weight classes may be the death knell ''Want a company where you can really put your education to work? See IBM Feb. 20th or 21st!' \Some of the engineers who graduated before me complained that their education didn't mean much in their jobs. That's not what I wanted,\ says IBM's Jim Carr. (Jim is a Manager of Mechanical Process Engineering. ) for RPI though Munno, Iannotti, Tripp can expect real rough tests. RPI has to be favored at 152, 160, and heavyweight, leaving 167, 177, and 191 as pivotal matches. If RPI can pull some upsets in the lower weight classes, the Garnet may need to win two of the key contests to cop the match. The Garnet face Oneonta State Tuesday night at 7 in Alumni Gym. Oneonta repre- sents one ·of the Garnet's tough- est foes. \At IBM I knew I'd be using what I learned. There's so much diversity here that you can usually work in the specific area you choose. In my own case, I majored in Mechanical Engineering and minored in Metallurgy. Today my ME degree means more than ever. And I often use my metallurgical background. For example, I'mnow working on a process development program that requires a knowledge of machine design, metallurgy, heat transfer, and chemistry, all of which I studied in school. \Another good thing about IBM's diversity is that it creates an interdisciplinary environment. You get a chance to work with and learn from people in many different fields. Since our industry is ~rowing so fast, the people you talk to are likely to be working at state-of-the-art levels or beyond.\ There's a lot more to the IBM story than Jim has mentioned.

The Dutchmen now stand at 5-9 and must win five of their- Tast six games to achieve a .500 season. King's Point jumped to an early 11-2 lead and only the fine shooting of Bill N eidel, who hit foux of his first five shots kept tlle Garnet in the ball game. With the score 23-20 and six minutes left to play in the half, the Mariners unleashed a fast break which buried the Garnet 16-6 to give King's Point a 39-25 halftime lead· The second half was not really a conte~t. but Craig Carlson ex- cited the crowd with eight str-aight points in a little over two minutes to cut the margin to twelve at 59-47. After that the Garnet faded and the final margin of 21 was the la1·gest of the night. Neidel scored 17, his eighth consecutive double figure ef- fort but no other Dutchman made double figures. Fitz Turn- er and Neidel shared rebound honors with 11 apiece, a depart- ment the Garnet dominated for the game 51-45. Union had a typical shooting night, making 18-71 for 39%. Coach Schmid considered Sat- urday's defensive effort one of the worst of the season as the Mariners solved Union's rare use of a zone, and also made shambles of an attempted man-to-man. The cagers seem to have lost the momentum gained in victories over Hobart and St. Lawrence and a good first half against Amherst.

RPI will be seeking re- venge .for a 22-15 defeat on the Troy mats last year. Hoopsters Travel to Troy Tuesday Nite By GARY PREVOST and DAN EGAN (Dall Egan is the managing ~di· tor and former Sports Editor of the Rensselaer Poly) Even when one team has been a heavy favorite due to .previ- ous performances, the results ()f :Rensselaer-Union athletic contests have not lent them· selves to safe betting. Conse- quently, wilen the Garnet bas- ket bah squad travels to Troy Tuesday night, there is only one thing that can be said with certainty about this battle be- tween evenly matched teams: the final score wHl depend Oll the ability of Dutchmen's ad- vantages m defense and board strength to overcome Rennsel'- aer's superio:r shooting. R.PI is currently sporting a 2-2 dual meet record, having handled Rechester and Hobart easily by scores of 32.5 and 24-8 while losing to powerhouses irom Springfield and Colgate, 41-0 and 23-10.

The ·Engineers, however, will be coming off a month layoff and may be a lit- tle rusty. Eleven Mate hes Union's Hooj)sters, sho-wn in action here, Face R. P.l. in a hot !Bottle Tuesday Night. With one exception, the tw() teams' records have been virtu- ally identical. Both started slowly, losing four of tileir first five games, both have beaten Hamilton, both have squeak- ed by ICAC opponent Ho- bart in the last seconds (Rens- selaer going into triple over- time before winning 63-62), and both were routed by ICAC lead- er Alfred. The exception came in their performances against Hartford when, after the Gar- net were trounced, 94-78, Rens- selaer caught tile Connecticut team on a had night and walked away with an eye-opening 79·59 upset for its first win. At press time, the Engineers own a 5·7 record and Union a 5-9 slate. Eleven matches will be con- tested, including the optional weigilt classes of 115 and 191. At 115 pounds, Union's :Ron Ruhl will be opposed by Ben Soren- son of .the Engineers. Sorenson was last year's ICAC champion at 115, but has dropped his only match in 1967-68. 1\tihl's only outing resulted in a victorious pin against Dartmouth. U n- defeated Bill Munno faces the Engineers' John Rothe at 123. Senior :Rothe, who Vtas beaten twice by Frank D'Antuono at 123 last year, stands 2-1 tilis season. D'Antuono, with a 5-0 mark on the season -will face either Tony Pavone or Gerardo Brown at 130: Pavone, a junior is 1-1 on tlte season wilile soph Brown is 0-2. At 137 pounds Ron Iannoti will be opposed by eitlher Ken Baer or Eric Blair· Baer, in- jured at Colgate, is :2-2. As a freshman he won a dedsion ov- er D'Antuono, but was injured last year. Blair, also a junior, scored wins over both Jeff Kur- zius (in 137 ICAC fiaal) and Iannoti last season. Tom Tripp, who is llndefeat- ed in three years of V'\lrestling at Union, will face Ri(h Tripodi at 145. Tripodi, a transfer from Colgate, has not competed in a dual meet this year. Co-captain Leigh Frye will face Gary Car· penter, another Colgate tl\ans· fer, at 152. Carpenter, a third place finisiler at Coast Guard, may be RPI's best wrestler. Frye, 3-2 on the season, has yet to win in the higher class of 152. Rematch At the 160 weight class, Ret Yelton and AI Hald will have a rematch of last year's dual meet encounter. Hald, who was Continued on Page 6 Matmen Crush Rochester; Despite the similarity in per- formances, however, the Dutch- men and the Engineers possess completely different teams. Ua- ion makes up for its poor shoot- ing ( 38 % from the floor and tO% from the three throw line) with a fair defense and good, if erratic, rebounding. Bill Nei- del, Cliff Feldman and Fitz Turner all have been pulling down more rebounds per game than any Rensselaer player. Win Five Matches By Pin The Garnet grapplers contin· ued their unbeaten season on Saturday, as they erushed the University of Rochester :38-3 in the Alumni Gym. Bill 1r unno got the I>utchmen off to a fine start, as he took an &-3 decision in his 123 match. ln the 130 class, Frank D'An- tuOilO once again put on a mas· terful }>erformance, pinning a tough Yellowjacket foe in 5:22. Frank l>uilt up an 1&-5 count against strong opposition before putting his Rochester counter- part to the mat. Iannotti Convi~tcing Ron Iannotti likewis.e scored convincingly, as he pinned his 137 opponent in 2:48_ :Ron also scored a near pin in the first period, and put his foe to the mat as the second period began. Tom Tripp and Leign Fwe won their 145 and 152 matches by forfeit. Everett Yelton, coming back to action after an injury that had sidelined him for the past two matches, looked t() be in top shape as he won his 160 contest by a pin in 4:3;;), Ret's foe was nearly pinned in the first period, but once again the Yellowjaci(et managed to slip out of l>oLtnds. In the 167 class, Naysim Si- mon won perhaps the most im- portant .single match of the sea- son. IIis foe was the previ- ously nndefeated Dave English, a qllic:k, strong grappler· Nay- sim fell behind 4-2 in the first period as he was taken down and escaped twice. Starting the second period from the \up\ position, Simon wore doawn his foe, as he \rode\ Eng.lish for the entire tht\ee-minute period. In the third stanza, Naysim be- gan \down quickly ~scaped, took Englisb to the mat, and pinned him with only 57 sec- onds gone. Rochest.er\s captain Lee Mit- chell handed the GarnEt their only defeat of the day, as ile won his 177 match lly a 10-5 score.

The Wh:t- manesque poet's idea of America's in- terest was considerably less material- istic, and centered on the unrighte- ousness of the murder of 3500 people a week· Ginsberg then proclaimed his dis- affection trom the American govern· ment, particularly the legacy of the ioreign policy of John Foster Dulles, by saying .. the war is over, except in Niggertown.\ In this respect he echo- ed Saul Alinsky, who spoke last Thursday and said .. I believe that as soon as the United States finishes bombing Viet Nam in order to secure free elections, the President will start bon:bing Mississippi and Alabama to get free elections there. ·• Concor:liensis learned this week of the college's involve- ment in wl:at Life magazine de- scribed as \one of the great finds of the current century in Amer- ican History.\ The article in Life tells the story of a long lost cache of George Washington's letters which tell the story of the trea- son ·of Brigadier General Bene- dict Arnold during the American Revolution. The letters had been missing for 187 years. They were discovered some time ago in Dor- set, Vt. Color Spread Life is covering the story in a large color spread in its issue to hit the newsstands Monday. News media from all over the capital district and Vermont have been invited to attend a press conference scheduled in the Winter Weekend Ticket Sales Down; So Are Van Curler Hotel Reservations Ticket sales for the Soul Survivors Concert Saturday night in Memorial Chapel appeared to be proceeding slowly early this week. Not half as slowly, though, as reser- '\ations have been collecting at the Van Curler Hotel, Schenectady's old- est and one of Union's favorite hotels until two weeks ago when it shut down on a claim of bankruptcy. For the first major Union weekend in the Van Curler's history, Union pa- trons will look elsewhere to put up out-of-town guests. The Soul Survisors, who came to fame with two hits, \Expressway to Your Heart\ and \Explosion in My Soul,\ will present two 45-minute shows separated by a 15-minute in- tel mission. High-li<'hting this year's Winter Weekend, the Soul Survivors begin ea(;h concert with the slogan: \When the whistle blows, everything goes ... but when you do it, do it with soul.\ They regularly play for standing- room only crowds. Included in the weekend festivities will be a basketball game against Clarkson Friday in Memorial Field House and the annual snow sculpture contest Saturday afternoon- The Van Curler Hotel recently closed. It be void of dates this Winter Weekend. The Convocation spealrer broke Memorial Chapel precedent with his use Qf fnnk Anglo-Saxonisms. The larg~. eoll.vocation audience wa~ bare- ly affecte-d however, althoagh listener reaction did peak when the poetic language was its most unc()nventlonal. Di>ctJssed Homosexl§,a/ity Ginsberg's stay at Union extended until We<inesday, when he was pres- ent at S() me of the classes of Profes- sors Calabria and Renza. Fol1owing lunch ()ll Tuesday, the be,arded poet had a thr'ee hour dialog with the stu- dents in tile Hale House L()unge. He spoke with utmost candor about the homosexual aspect of his personality, his attittJ.des toward the use of psy- chedelic and harucinigenie drug<>, the quagmire- of the American political scene, and his personal literary heritage. Slocum Makes 4 Hour Valentine Run Eulogy to Williatr~s The first half of the Convocation was involved with intensely personal poetry. l\1any included e:xplanations of his h()rnosexuality. One· poem was an eulogy to his mento:r, William Carlos Williams. Also, he pleaded for his ()Wn castration, ill. effect, so that his intellect would not be warped by libidinal influences. Ginsberg's second hour of poetry featured the presentation of a com- position that was written in a Volks· wagen ca.mper that was driving back and fort!J. between Lincoln, Nebraska and Wicaita, Kansas. In a well-docu· mented discourse, Ginsberg touched on many ()f the same points as did historian Henry Steel Commager last m()nth. The Newark native, whose delivery was nattually quite different from that of tlt:e Amherst scholar, said that the \worl<i's largest camp c-.>medy [isl the war in Viet Nam.\ Commager's thesis was that the assumptions that have led to the American presence in Viet Nan are inaccurate, that we in fact have no \vital interests,\ we are not confr-onting the drive of world Next time you plan to visit a Skidmore girl, give her a break. Tell her you're driving. After Union's Bob Slocum Tuesday told Pam Bailey of Skidmore that he would \run up to see her\ Wednes- day afternoon, Pam expected him to come up after his three-hour grant- in-aid job for the college - not dur- ing it. And she didn't eount on Slocum, and consequently herself, making na- tional publicity for their Valentine's Day rendezvous. Sweatshirt Slocum was clad in a grey sweat- suit, black converse sneakers, his dis- tinctive wire-rimmed glasses and a large red heart pasted on his chest when he set out from Theta Delta Chi at 12:30 p.m. to capture his val- entine. He arrived at Garden View Hall, 21% miles away, after more than four hours of constant running in Wednesday's semi-blizzard. Despite considerable publicity in the tri-cities area anticipating the journey, Pam appeared surprised at the efforts of the gasping Slocum. She was par- ticularly touched by the single daffo- dil Slocum presented her upon arrival. Dozen Flowers It was a token representing the best of a dozen flowers Felthousen Florists contributed when they heard about the journey. \He needed moral support,\ they said. The rest of the flowers were taken to Saratoga by Dave Jillson who drove ahead with a sign on the car reading: Caution- Runner. Slocum said Pam is not really his girl, explaining \I've just gone out with her a few times.\ \I just wanted to throw a show for somebody,\ he said. \She was a handy person to throw a show for.\ A show he threw: WTEN was on hand at the start of the marathon in front of Theta Delta Chi, Slocum's fraternity. Associated Press was at the finish for pictures and a story which the Albany bureau expected would be moved throughout the coun· try by this morning. Kazoo Just in case nobody noticed him, Slocum ran through the streets of Saratoga playing his kazoo. Slocum counted on running the last 16 miles of the trip to Skidmore via route 50 on what he called ''psy- cric energy,\ In case that was not enough, he grabbed a. glass of orange juice and a candy bar supplied by his friends every seven miles. Slocum expected to sleep late this morning. But he described the Valen- tine's Day marathon in sub·freezing weather \just sort of a furt thing.\ Robert Slocum makes Valentines Day run to Saratoga. He delivered this heart to his Skidmore girl. Music room of Schaefer Library Sunday at- 3 p.m., where announ- cement of the details will be made. Sunday's announcement has been timed for release to coin- cide with the publication Monday of Life. The college sent out post cards to friends and a!lumni of tl~e college announcing the forth- coming nation-wide publicity. No Restrictions There will be no restrictions on photographs, films or sound recordings at Sunday's confer- ence. Visual materials pertaining to the discovery will be on ex- hibit, and college officials will answer questions on the discov- ery. Film Made To Promote Fund Drive By PAUL FA.RNHAM An eighteen minute. film designed \to help show alumni and friends the story of Union College today\ is be- ing made on campus this month ac- cording to 0. A. Pendleton, Capital Campaign counsel. The film, whiC!h shows the activities in which students and faculty are en- gaged, will be presented around the country to gatnerings of alumni and friends who are interested in the ccmpaign. A 'thl()ugh it is an introduc- tion to the cap]tal program, the film is not an explicit appeal for funds. Pendleton desC'ribed it as \a back- grc.und of what Union is doing and what it might nope to do.\ It is hoped that the film will be a good cross sectional view of the col- !~ge today. Although Pendleton does not know exactly what will be in- cluded in the final version of the film, these general a:reas will be covered: classrooms, lectures, laboratories, the computer center, student activities such as the All College and the stu- dent orchestra, athletic events, infor- mal student living, and the exterior of the campus.. Pend'eton believes the film will include both nostalgia and the new and modern. Work was started on the idea of the film several years ago because the ad- ministration felt that this type of pub- licity was necessary, It is believed that the film w11l eventually be used for purposes in addition to those ctir- rently olanned. This would include use by the admissions office for pr()s- r ective students· The film is being made by a pro- fessional firm which specializes in college motion pictures and has made movies of Williams, Amherst, and Dartm<'uth. The costs are included as part of the capital campaign budget. About half of the filming has al- ready been don~. Pendleton believes that one more week of filming will probably be nee-essary, and hopes that the film will be read for showing by April. Parties Open The Inter-Fniternity Council did not remove the controversial \closed- party'' motion from the table at the special meeting held with Pres. Mar- tin last Thursday. Most fraternity rarties on Winter Weekend will there- fore be open, as has been the prac- tice in the past. The motion proposes. to establish a 1'1 ystem providing each fraternity with the means to elose parties should a h11use choose to do so. Each fratern- ity man would receive an IFC card, uoon which his name and the name of his house wo:u 1 d appear. A fraternity ~ould therefore admit all students,. only those with cards, or only those whose cards had the name of that particular house. In this man- ner, parties could be closed to Inde- pendents, or to the entire campus.

• ~ 2 Thursday, February 16, 1968 Thursday, I· \) Frind Drive Advan.ces Summer Work Campt Applications Sought II\ l Ne By MICHAEL D. CltOWLEY Total donations to the Union Col- lege Capital Program mounted this week to $4.1 million, and many more giits are likely to be announced with- ln the next ilve months, lVlr. Frank- mt Kneedler told Concordiensis Tues- day. Mr. Kneedler, Assistant to the Pres- ident for External Affairs, felt cer- ta1n that the $12.5 million goal wou1d be met within the Cap1tal Program's tirst three years oi operation. The Union College Capital Pro- gram is the first major fund-raising venture undertaken h.ere; smaller programs were organized !n the past to !inance the constn.tct10n of the l''ield House and the :.Schaefer Library. '!'he fmal, ten-year goal <Jf the pro- gram is to receive donation of $30 million. Although Mr. Kneedler could not give exact percentages, he believes approximately two-thirds of the $30 rmllion will go towards general en· dowment ~ scholarships, carriculum improvements, and salary incr~ases for the faculty - and the remamder will be for construction costs. Mr. Kneedler explained that more scholarships for deserving students were necessary \to prevent Union from becoming a rich ruan's school.\ He alsa stated that increased salaries for the faculty were necessary to draw the best professors available to union. The $1.4 million recently receiv~d from the federal government wlll likely enable constructicn of the new Science and Engineering Complex to begin this spring or summer. Mr. Kneedler said, he recognized, how- ever the urgent need for a student cent~r for social facilities. The Capital Program began in October 1966 when an announcement of the plans was made to specially invited alumni and fr.iends of the College. During its first year, ffil.).Ch of the work was done in researchmg prospective donors and in general or- ganizing. Mr. 0. A. Pendleton, of Marts & Lundy, a professional fund· counselling firm, was called in to help direct the Program. Last No· vember a Leadership Conference was held here at Union to clarify to major prospective donors Uni<>n's ne~,;ds and plans for the future. 'Today ~n New York City, another Leadershtp Con- ference was held, at wh.ich separate faculty, . student, and administration panels discussed Union's potential and reasons for expansion. Afterwards, President Martin addressed the audi- en:ce of alumni and friends of the College. To raise the necessary money, pro- spective major donors, who are ex- pected to contribute up to 90% of the total. are approached on a per· sonal basis by tit;eir peers: the Trust- ees of the College and members of the National Steering Committee, a group of alumni worldng together under the Capital Program. Many donations have lleen made that can- not yet be publicised; other donors are waiting at t:he moment and will contribute more capital as others con- tribute, Mr. Kneedler said. The success of the Annual Fund is very important, Mr. Kneedler feels, because many of the major donors use it as a barometer when deciding about their donations. Publications, meetings between alumni, administra- tion, and donors, and a newly-filmed movie af Union and her students are all promoting the Capital Program . Not only the needs and prospects of the College, 'but also the strong, enthusiastic student body and faculty are important in influencing donors' decisions, Mr. Kneedler said. He also made it clear that certain areas of the campaign can.not be rushed, but if the response i:s as good as expected, the quota will be met without doubt. Dean Asks For Funds To Aid Injured Boy Funds con.tinue to .pour in for Rock Warner. 'Rock' Fund Thanks to contributions last week by two fraternities and the freshman class, the Rock Warner Educational Fund Drive is progressing with great success, Brad Craig, treasurer, told Concordiensis Wednesday. Craig said Chi Psi pledged $250, five dollars a member., to the fund which proposes to aid Robert Warner, a Union junior injured in an auto- mobile accident last summer, to re- turn to school next year. Phi Epsilon Pi promised to add $100 to conth·butions from individual brothers in tllat house, and the mem- bers of Delta Phi, Rock's fraternity, collected more than $450 from the freshman class. 'l'he donations collected this week add to $1:000 pledged previously by Delta Phi and an offer by Phi Sigma Delta to match the contributions of its members and pledges. 'I'o supplement the funds already collected and pledged, Delta Phi will operate a car wash next Saturday at the Gulf Station on the corner of Brandywine and State Street from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Students interested in the Amer- ican Friends Service Committee Sum- mer Work Camps should attend· a meeting in Dr. Johnson's office in Sil'liman Hall on Monday, February 19 at 7:30. Dr. Johnson and Dr. Freid will lead a discussion of the program. Three Union students who participated in the program last summer will be at the meeting to talk to anyone. These students are Bob Kisabeth, Scott Sei- gler, and David Conat. The camps are located throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. The stu- dent works at two camps over a per- iod of three months in the summer. Unio n offers grants to two students to pay one,half of their expenses for the summer. Anyone who would like to apply for the grant should attend the meeting Monday. Noone Spea.ks To lRC \The World Bank- What It is Anti What It Does\ was the subje.t d a speech to the International Re'at:on<; Club by Thomas Noone, Director of Information for the World Bank. Noone explained that the World Bank is an international develop· mental institution. It lends money to underdeveloped countries at better terms than they would receive .from a regular international bank. The World Bank loans money in the areas of transportation, power, in- dustry, agriculture, and education and lends its funds taking into account the chances for financial success of the specific project without regard to the political situation in the coun- try involved. In total, 107 countries participate in the programs of the Bank in some form. This includes most countries in the world excluding the Communist nations. ,, • . Ill 'Th11 sec bacl~:er w: term.

IRCGrants The Union-Skidmore Interna- tional Relations Club is spon- soring the nomination of two students, one for the Experi- ment In International Living program and one for the Citizen Ambassador Program, both in conjunction with Union College. The Citizen Ambassador Pro- gram will last for six weeks this summer beginning on .rune 30. Its objectives are to involve uni- versity students in the cause of international understanding and friendship. It promotes discussion related to this subject between Ameri- can students representatives and their counterparts abFoad. The main program ranges in cost from $J50 to $1000. In ad- dition, there are optional tours which include visits behind the Iron Curtain. While the Citizen Ambassa- dor Program concentrates on Europe, The Experiment in In- ternational Living involves six continents- Each year this pro- gram sends more than 2000 young Americans to live with families in some fifty countries. Experimenters also enjoy an in- formal trip about the country, usually accompanied by mem- beds or friends of their host families, or partidpate in a work or field study project. Those students who are in- terested in either program can f btain further information in Dean Olton's office and should sign up by February in order to be considered as a candidate for e:ther program.

Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no squeak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on your lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna :3uper Stainless Steel Blades. I have been shaving for 71 years (11ot too impressive until one considers that I am 49 years old~ and I am here to tell you that the quietest blade I know is .Personna. I not €Jnly shave with Personna, but I also ad:rnire it. Old vir- tues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Per- sonna is a modest blade, an undemanding- blade. Personna cloes not rasp and tug, yelling, \Hey lookit me!\ No, sir, Dot Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Per- sonna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It shucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble. Why, you hardly know it's there, this weU-bred Personna blade, this paragon of punctilio. Moreover, this crown of the blade-maker's art, this epitome of epidermal efficacy, is available both in Double- · Edge style and Injector style. Do your kisser a favor: get =some. 2. Breakfast properly. • I assert that a Personna shave is the best of all :possible =shaves. But I do not assert that a Personna shave, brae- jug though it may be, is enough to prepare you for the l!ideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an ample breakfast. Take, for example, the case of Basil Metabolism, a soph- <>more at V.M.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspec- tion by the Commandant one morning, prepared by stor- ing up ene:r:gy. He recognized titat coffee and juice would Jlot sus·,ain him, so he had a flitch of baeon, a clutch of -Eggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a. bunch of butter, ~ swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a t,h.atch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt. The idea was right; the quantities, alas,,were not. When the Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so torpid that he could not raise his bloated arm in a proper salute. He was, of course, immediately shot by a firing squad. Today, a perforated man, he earns a meagre living as a collander in Cleveland. 3. Read properly. Always read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting. But do not read the front page. That is :full of bad, acid- making news. Read a more pleasant :part of the paper- the Home and Garden section, for example. For instance, in my local paper, The Westport Peasant, there is a delightful column called \Ask: Hal:\ry Home- spun\ which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and many an earthy chuckle. I quote some questions and answers: Q: I am thinlcing of buying some power tools. What should I get first? A: Hospitalization. Q: How' do you get rid of moles? A: Pave the lawn. Q: What is the best way to put a 7t,ide car in a narrow gamge? A: Butter it . .. Q: What do you do for elm blight? A: Salt water gargle and bed rest. Q: What can I do for dry hair? A: Get a wet hat. * * * © 1968, Max Sb.ulman Personna's partner in slwving comfort is Burma- .Shave, regular or menthol.

Do It Yourself The recent rumblings of the Inter-Fraternity Council C!Onc.erning the possibility of instituting a system whereby Fraternity houses could close theil~ parties or admit i:nde:pendents on a restricted basis should prod the inde- penclents t(l thought about the future of their social life at tJnion. If sorne or all of the Fraternities choose to deny ad- Dli~sion to their parties to some or all independents, a num- be:r of problems may be solved, and at least one other on-e will be raised. Fraternity parties, under this system, 01ay be less \rowdy\ (though it would seem that the tone of a house party is set by the brothers themselves, not by sone independents that may wander in), and the burden of nearly-prohibitive social fees which some brothers now EJa.y (to buy a band and liquor for some independents) may be lightened. On the other hand, the independent, whose few oppor- tunities for parties now come generally on party weekends, 'NOilld find that at the time wl:en he most needs a party, :11one is open to him. The decision by the IFC to postpone a c:leci~ion on closing parties until next week, has taken the Jliessure off the independents for this Winter Weekend, b11 t what ab()ut Spring Weekend? The time has arrived for the independents to begin to -pay their own way, and run their own parties. They have 'been to content for too long to \sponge\ from the fratern- ]ties, ,and have developed little responsibility for their own ::;oci al life. sufficiently long to be reliable. It must a·lso be re:presentative. Here the implied basis would be randomi~ation. I have rea- son to question that basis. It happens that I support the principle of the pol]. I also had my students rate tll.is course. M:y sample was 10() '} . One stu- dent omitted the fi:ve,point ra- ting scale, which is comparable to that used in tll.e campus study. The poll was unsigned and done in the classroom with- out consultation. The results were: Excellent: !:i; Good: 5; Fair: 2; Poor: 3 ; Extremely Poor: 1. The contrast between the two sets of data. invites spec- ulation. Coult it be, by chance, that I just happened to draw in the campus study all four of the men who found my work less than enchanting, but only one of the ten rating it at least good? The pollsters should next time explain bow the data were collected, especially as to whether these were \private ballots.\ I trust there wiH be future editions of Linebacker. The la· bor and costs are fm:·midable in scope. But fairness requires that all courses be covered, and that the same course with dif· ferent class members be sam- pled. Also, ins()far as our \grades\ are meant to help us improve, we shou.ld be given the chance to see if we can. If the other 32 questions in the survey were not processed, costs would be rednced by not 11sing them.

These parties need not be any less enjoyable than the best of the fraternity parties. In the spring, the Field House may be used for parties.

The cocktail parties that have been held in Fox House dur-ing the last two years are evidence that independents · can. organize their own social events if they wish.

If the brothers of a house keep themselves under control, an unruly independent will either feel uneasy and. b~red at that party, or he will be asked to leave. But if:=====~====================~ a~rnission to parties is restricted, perhaps it will at last.· stimulate the UIC and the independents in general, to begin to take responsibility for their social lives upon themselves. No MoreRequire~nent The Convocation held Tuesday, featuring Allen Gins- berg, was definitely the biggest convocation success of this ?ear. Only the lecture by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. last year dFew as many intensely interested people into the Chapel. Th€ enthusiasm shown for Mr. Ginsberg offers sub- stantial evidence that if the college attempts to bring to the campus persons of national significance and interest to the student, the chapel will be filled with an attentive audience. There is. neither need nor justification for attenQ.ance requirem€nts if convocations feature programs such as w.e ba ve had this term. In the case of less known lecturers, scheduling their programs in the small lecture hall in SS 1:6- would serve to prevent any embarrasment caused by a small turnout. Under these conditions, we urge that both the appr()priate students and faculty organizations take a. stand in favor of abolishing the convocation attendance requirement - the antiquated vestige of required chapel.

They, too, have a base on the moon. The gov- ernment 0f the moon has asked the United States for aid, be- cause the Communists were stealing the lunar surface in commission. divided the lunar surface into the North and South Moons. The North is a puppet state of the Communists. Tne southern government is the true representative of the peo- ple of the moon. We cannot per- mit two separate states to be set up, for it cou:ld only lead to a.nother Vietnam, Korea, or Ber- llh. The moon must remain as one nation. (Applause).

For enlightenment, see Professod Willison, So- ciology Department, or Tom Tripp, Beta Theta Pi. While we are certain that Mr. Robbins had good intentions in criticizing our article, we feel that his claims were fallacious. First of all, we did not contend in our article that Goldwater actually had advocated the use of low·yield atomic weapons. We merely pointed out that \news- papers reported that Goldwater has proposed using small-scale at()mic bombs,\ which Mr. Rob- bins in fact admits they did. Secondly, Mr. Robbins gives no reason why he felt our article was weakened .by including the mathematician's calculation; we can only reply that we included it because we felt it emphasized the magnitude of U.S. spending in Vietnam. Thirdly, our state- ment, \the Administration is torn over the issue\ is support- able by the once rumored but no~v attualresignations of McNa- mara and Gardner. We included the rumors of Goldberg's and Fowler's resignations and West- moreland's dismissal merely to augment our original claim and feel that its basic tenet was not at all weakened by the inclusion of the rumors, which were re- ported two weeks ago in News- week. It appears that Mr. Rob- bins was not discriminating enough in his reading of the article; we woutd caution him against advising others to get their \facts straight\ before he himself has returned the favor.

LIFE INSURANCE An Equal Opportunity Employer TAKE ONE Meeting the Threat Our original advisors helped the moon people train their army to meet with any Com- munist aggression. Battles have since broken out in many parts of the moon, especially around its capital, New Saigon. We have recently added 75,000 American troops to help the moon peop- ple. Our troops will not be used unless it is absolutely necessary. There is some fear that fight- ing on the moon could spread to the earth. But, my fellow Americans, we must realize that if we do not meet the Commun- ist threat on the moon, we will someday face the prospects of a larger war on Venus, Mars, or Saturn.

Rounded Students The final year wiH present a less varied program in ·order to allow the student to make up the class time he has Iost pur- suing the Camp Ed require- ments. However the student must choose from these three alternatives: 1) Maintaining Jackson's Gardens, 2) Explain- ing to visitors the genuine but hard to perceive architectural beauty of Nott Memorial, and 3) Exploring the possibility of showing some English language films in the SS 016 Film series, and making sure that the reels are projected in proper order to present the repetition of some past confusion. As can easily be seen .such Comp Ed revisions will lead to the creation of a better educa- ted and academically fulfilled student. Next time the adminis- tration polls the student body to determine course prefer- ences, be sure to indicate your support for our proposals. The Soviet Union is supply- ing China with equipment on the moon. We do not want to put a blockade around the North Moon's main port, Mao City, but we may be forced to take this action. Furthermore, the Soviets have accused the United States of imperialism on the moon. The second year of the pro- gram features Comprehensive Education in Gym.

FOR HONEST SERVICE AND GOOD JEWELRY ~.~~-·- ~- --- ----------- MATHEMATICIANS: What Do You Know About nsa? The National Security Agency is a scien- tific and technological community unique in the United States, perhaps in the world. NSA is the Agency responsible for de- veloping \secure\ communications sys- tems and EDP devices to transmit and receive vital information. YOU AND NSA As a mathematician at NSA, you will define, formulate and solve communica- tions-related problems, many of major national significance. Statistical mathe- matics, matrix algebra, finite fields, probability, combinatorial analysis, pro- gramming and symbolic logic are but a few of the tools applied by Agency mathematicians. They enjoy the full sup- port of NSA's completely equipped com- puter laboratory where many of them become involved in both the hardware and software of advanced computing systems. Theoretical research is also a primary concern at NSA, owing to the fact that the present state of knowledge in certain fields of mathemat~s is not sufficiently advanced to satisfy NSA re- quirements. IMAGINATION ..• A REAL REQUIREMENT Mathematical problems at NSA will sel- dom l:le formulated and handed to you, the mathematician, for solution. Instead, you will help define the problem by <lb- servlng its origin and characteristics and the trends of data associated with it. You will then determine whether the problem and data are susceptible to mathematical treatment and, if so, h<Jw. As you grow in your appreciation of this approach to mathematical problems, and the relationship of your discipline to non-mathematical subject matter, both your personal satisfaction and your value to NSA will Increase, as will your responsibility. CON11NUING YOUR EDUCATION? NSA's graduate study program may per- mit you to pursue two semesters of full- time graduate study at full salary. Nearly all academic costs are borne by NSA, whose proximity to seven universities is an additional asset. SALARIES AND BENEFITS Starting salaries, depending on educa· tlon and experience, range from $7,729 to $12,873, and increases follow as you assume additional responsibility. Poli- cies relating to vacations, insurance and retirement are liberal, and you enjoy the advantages of Federal employment with- out the necessity of Civil Service certi- fication. Another benefit is the NSA location. be- tween Washington and Baltimore, which permits your choice of city, suburban or country living and allows easy access to the Chesapeake Bay, ocean beaches and other summer and winter recreation areas.

The Garnet must now win all four of their re- maining games for a .500 season. The Dutchmen parlayed a tight man-to-man detense and a new offense to battle arch-nval RPI down to the wire before succumbmg to eight straight En- gineer free throws in the hnal minute and a half on the Troy boards.

Jeff K1rkpatrick hoop- ed 13, Inciudmg 11 m the second half. The Garnet opened up a 17-12 lead midway through the first half but needed a five point spurt tn the final rnmute to gam a il0-26 halftime lead. The new Garnet offense, which used two forwards at the side of the lane, and a. third forward rotatmg around them worked well set- tmg up easy inside hoops. With Knight and Turner do- ing the bulk of the scoring the Garnet gained their largest lead of the night at 44-36 with 12 minutes remaining. However, wtth Tt!.rner benched on .four fouls and the Garnet commit- ting seven turnovers in the next four minutes, RPl gained the lead at 47-45· The margin was never more than that as both teams traded baskets for the next six minutes. The key play in the game occurred with 1 :50 rcmainmg when the Garnet gained an offensive rebound aft- er Jeff Kirkpatrick's free throw brought them within one at 57- 56. '1 he cagers committed their last and most costly turnover to set the stage for six straight free throws by RPl reserve Bob Opelia. His first two free throws foll<Jwed by a fast break basket gave the Engineers an insur- mountable five point lead with 50 seconds remaining. The Garnet enjoyed their best sho<Jting night of the year, hit- ting on 24 of 46 for 52S(, mak- ing 13 of 21 in the second half. In the second half however, the Dutchmen found it more diffi- cult to work the ball inside, as Feldman and Knight were able to get only five shots. Carlson and Kirkpatrick held RPI's high scoring guards to a total of 15 pointE but a 15 point perform- ance by reserve center Tom Nar- di saved the Engineers. RP I's superior ball-handling and f<lul shooting had to be con- sidered as the difference as they committed just nine turnovers in th-€ game and shot 19 of 23 from the charity stripe, compar- ed t(} 14 of 23 by the Garnet Saturday night the cagers overwhelmed a poor Stevens Tech team in Hoboken, N.

The center is 6-5 sen- ior Paul Tompkins, who is aver- aging 3-8 per game, and is the second leading rebounder. The other starters are 6-2 forward Darryl DiHenback and 5-8 guard Dave Snare. Middlebury would have to be classed as a \good 0-16 team,\ if such a classification is possi- b ·e. Since Christmas the Panth- ers have given a good account of themselves against strong competition, losing to Wesleyan S6-84, MIT 78-66, and St. Mich- ael's 70-66. The Panthers are h:d by 6-3 soph center Eugene Oliver. a fine jumper and two ~ood shooting guards: 5-8 Dave Vanier and 5-11 Kevin Ducey. lhe starting forwards are 6-1 senior Robert Reed and 6-2 Rich Minton. Middlebury is a good offensive ball club (e.g. 54 sec- ond half vs Hamilton) but a lack of defensive prowess has been their downfall. The Panthers have allowed 92.5 points per game including seven 100 point performances. Trinity is suffering from in- juries, and a lack of consistency. The Bantams lost several key perforrrers early in the season, and they have been rounding into shape slowly. Jim Stuhl- man has been the only steady performer thus far for Trinity, contributing near 20 points per j:;ame.

A!CC Discusses By GARY PREVOST In a surprise announcement this week George Flood was named to the position of chairman of the Depart- ment of Physical Education and Di- rector of Athletics. The appointment will be effective September 1, 1969 when Wilfred Ketz, the present di- rector, assumes the position of Direc- tor of Institutional Research. Earlier Promoted Coach Flood who earlier this month had been promoted from instructor to assistant professor, is expected to remain as football coach at least through the 1969 season. Combined Positions? His further continuation in the foot- ball position will depend upon en evaluation of his ability to combine the positions of athletic director and fotball coach. At that time a realign- ment of the coachlng staffs might allow Coach Flood to continue. Happy Surprise Concerning hls appointment, Flood stated that he \was pleased but sur- prised to achieve my goal so eaxly in life.\ He also said he felt he would like to be a football coach for several more years' and that he could handle both jobs.

A Union College Research Professor , ~ has discovered a major cache of orig- inal letters from George Washington l I '· and other important figures of the Revolutionary War period in a home in Dorset. Vt. Eleven of the Washington letters had never been published in any form, while others varied from previously published versions. . , 1 Th~ entire collection, which includes 51 letters from Washington among its 87 items~ is now in the Schaffer Li- brary at Union. The existence of the letters and b documents was discovered by Dr. Cod· man Hislop, Research Professor of American Civilization at Union. The -- 0\:V'l).er of the papers is John L. Hawkes of Dorset, Vt. Life Magazine, in its current (Feb. 23 ) - issue, calls the accidental dis\ covery \one of the great finds of the present century.\ •1. The bulk of the material, known as the W.

He died in 1786, at the age of 55. . The list of signatures of the le:tters in the Hawkes Collection is a _.erit- able who-was-who of the Revolutionary period.

Israel Putnam, Edmund Randolph, and Philip Schuyler, in addition to Washington. Hamilton is represented by a prev- iously unknown letter, the second earliest yet discovered. The letter, written while he was a student, apolo- gizes for Hamilton's failure to return some borrowed books, whlch had been stolen fr~m his room at King's Col- lege, now Columbia. The text of the letter reads: Dr. sir: It Is with the utmost chagrin I am obliged to inform you, that I am not able to return you all your pamph· lets; and what is still worse to most valuable of them is missing. - I beg you will11ot impute it to carelessness; for I assure you upon my honor the tr11e state of the case is this - I put yow· pamphlets in the case with my other books; and some person about the College got into my room through the window, broke open my case, & took out The friendly address, Bank~ rofts treatise, Two volumes of natural philosopby and a latin authors - I have procured another Friendly ad· dress t.:. replace the one lost; and have taken all possible pains to re· covet &ankroft's treatise or to get another in its stead; but my endeavors have heretofore been fruitless -- Mr. Abram J..ivingston thinks he can get Coatinued on Page 2 identification cards with photographs; and began an extended study of way-s in which the posture of the residence program might be improved. All de- cisions were handed down without a single formal vote by the ACC mem- bers. Although the Student Council voted unanimously last month to increase the Student Activities Fee from $11 to $15 beginning with the Spring term, the Administration planned to wait until the beginning of next year to initiate the increase, since the Col· lege policy has been not to change fees in the middle of the school year. Jim Rubenstein, chairman of the Tax Committee and member of the ACC, convinced the Council of the ~eed to break precident so that the madequate income of the Tax Com- mittee would not hinder the growth of new activitles such as the Political Forum, the North End, the Council for the Arts. \Our parking problem is one partly of habit and partly of the dispositi()n of the buildings,\ said President Mar- tin as he summed up the discussion of tl'affic congestion in the inner campus. Although the Council charged Dean Olton with drafting the new .parking regulations, they agreed that fines should be increased significantly and that regulations should be zeal- ously enforced. Lance Spallholz, President of the UIC, said that the Council feels {)b~ ligated to provide party entertain· ment if the iraternities close their parties to Independents. He explained, however, that at present the UIC account has only $250, its profits fr()m the operation of North College Hotel. President Martin replied that be would back the UIC through the rest of the year from his Contingency Fund; . until it makes enou.gh money from North College revenues to be self-supporting. Spallholz emphasized that these UIC functions would be run on a pay as you go basis.

Discovery of the papers brought to light a document oi:ten sought by his- torians but never found, the 1etter which gave Washington his first hint ui Benedict Arnold's treason. The letter, lost since 1780, was writ- ten by Lt. Col. John Jameson of the :.md Light Dragoons, following the capture of one \John Anderson\ near ·l'arrytown, N.Y., on Sept. 23, 1780. \Anderson\ was in reality Maj. John Andre, the British officer negotiating with Arnold. Jameson's letter transmitted a pack- et of papers found in Andre's stock- mg. Included in the papers were plans of the American fortifications at West Point, which perhaps prompted Jame- son's observation that the papers were ··of a most dangerous tendency.\ The text of the letter follows: North Castle Septr. 23d. 1780 Sir that about one half of the Meu are witho11t Blankets or. Cooking tJtensile for which reason I am obliged to quarter them at houses Col. Wells's Men have Tents and most of their Baggage which are rather difficult to move about. I am with regard & Esteem Your Excellenceys. most Obedt. Servant John Jameson The documents section of the New York State Police Laboratory assisted the Schaeffer Library in efforts to read some illegible portions of the Jameson letter. The letter, which is now being investigated by Prof. His- lop, apparently came into the Hawkes Collection via Lt. Col. John Lawrence, McDougall's son-in-law and the judge- advocate at Andre's military trial as a spy. Lawrence was the great-great- grandfather of John Lawrence Hawk- es, the present owner of the papers. Mr. Hawkes said he took possession of the papers in 1958, when his mother gave him a dilapidated suitcase fuU of \family papers\ from the Hawkes home on Long Island. He later sorted them and found, in addition to the usual family memorabilia, a number of pieces dating from the Revolution. Some had been catalogued by his grandfater, W. Wright Hawkes. who once planned to do a biography of Gen. McDougall. The grandfather had apparently held back a choice selection when he gave the New York Historial Society a collection of Gen. McDougall's pap- ers in 1870. Another gift of papers went to the society in 1940, upon the death of a son, R. Forbes Hawkes, the father of John L. Hawkes. Not included in this second gift were the items in a suitcase, thought to con- tain only business papers of another member of the family. That suitcase subsequently yielded the latest group of Revolutionary documents. .$,. •. .... ,$~'., , ' .. /;:·. • • · ~, \'~ .. ~'jtL< . •.· ,~ • ~ • • ·~-~ ...... .-<\ ~l )~ '';.,.' j} ,., .; This is thco original letter to Wash- ington revealing the treason of Bene- dict Arnold. SUNY Plans Viet Parlay A Conference on Viet-Nam posing the question \How Can We End the War?\ will be held on the new cam- pus of the State University at Albany on Friday evening, February 23 through Saturday evening, February 24. In examining alternative answers to this question, tne Conference will have an intensely practical emphasis, foc- using on toreign policy issues and on the debate over peace movement tactics. There will be panel discus- sions and audience participation at every session. In 1963, when Mr. and Mrs, Hawkes moved from Florida to Vermont, the collection was put in a cardboard box and stored in a Manchester, Vt., bank. There the .papers remained until 1964, when it occurred to M:r. Hawkes that his son's class at Dorset elementary school might like to see an actual Washington letter as part of its im- pending celebration of Washington's Birthday, He inquired at the Dorset Library for someone interested in American history who might be willing to talk with the class about the letter. The librarian referred him to Prof. Hislop, who lives in Dorset. \John called me,\ Prof. Hislop re- called later, \and asked if I'd be will- ing to look at his family papers. and perhaps talk to the children about them, I said I was very busy but that I'd look into it, so he delivered a cardboard box full of papers to r·v house. It sat on the couch for a week, until I finally got around to it one evening, \When I opened that box I went into a state of shock.\ Prof. Hislop called in Dr. Edwin K. Tolan, librarian of the Schaffer Library at Union, who took charge of the bibliographical study 1 authentica· tion, and evaluation of tne papers. The entire collection was moved to the Union College library in 1966. Under terms of the agreement. with Mr. Hawkes, Union will hold the pap- ers \for the purpose of scholarly re- search\ under the ~eneral supervision of Prof. Hislop unbl1976. Mr. Hawkes has willed the papers to the college upou his death. Local news media from the Capital District covering the story included: WTEN-TV, WRGB, WGY, WROW, the Knickerbocker News. and the Sche- nectady Gazette. A reporter from the New York Daily Times attended and publicity also went to the New York Times. Both the Associated Press and United P1ess International were ex- pected to give the story national pub- licity. ·rhe debaters spoke on the following topic - Resolved: That the United :3tates should follow a policy of isola- ti()nism. 1Jnion's affirmative teqm, consisting of Hal Ross and Rich Weiner came within a hair's breadth of winning tll.e entire tournament, as they won tll.ree and lost only one. The loss cil.me in the fourth and semi-final t()·Und to the team from Wesleyan University, by the close score of 49~43 out of a possible 50 points. The team from Wesleyan then continued on to become tournament champions, easily defeating the University of Western (i)ntario. Union finished in a tie for third, ,having defeated Sir George Williams University, McGill and the University of Pittsburg. Representing Union on the negative side of the issue were Bob Beitman and Ted Kreinik. This tournament marked the return of Union to winning ways in intercol- legiate debating. Hopefully, . the next few months will bring further vic- tories. Wine Tasting WRUC sponsored a wine testing ·!!lass in the Rathskeller on Wednes- day night.

LUIGI'S RESTAURANT SPECIALIZING IN Italian- American Food The Union Politi!!al Forum, long in- active, has been revitalized in the past month under new leadership and with altered goals and functions. Formerly, the Forum had simply serv- ed as a floor for debate between the Young Democrats and the Young Re- publicans, and had had little or no purpose in the college community. The Forum has been restructured, however, and now is an entirely non· partisan organization, open to any stu- dent interested hi political affairs whatever his affili~tions. The new president of the club is Ab Stillman ( 69) 1 who feels the For- um can and must become an import- ant part of Union's extra-curricular life. He and the present members plan to attack many tasks which have not been fulfilled sati$factorily i:n the past by other campus organizations. Specifically, the Forum intends to present nine or ten speakers a year, ranging from political theorists to United States Senators; to serve as a sponsor for faculty discussion of eur- TERM PAPERS TYPED 25<: per page SAL FALACE 1125 BARRETT ST.

This latter \ goal will be implemented by research projects on the part of club members who will be directly related to an internship program for Union stu- dents at Albany druiug the school ' year. Future plans call for Union spon· sorship of a Model Congress in the fall with representation of nearly all schools in the northeast being \ present on campus. The Forum is under the joint spon- sorship of Professors Underwood and Daniels of the Political Science De· ' partment, both of whim seem quite interested in filling the intellectual void which the Forum will seek to replace. The club is still recruiting, important positions are still open, such as committee membership and chairs, and welcomes anyone inter- este<j. in joining to call Ab Stillman at 372-9772.

Martin States Views At a special meeting held re- cently with the fraternity pres- idents, President Martin began to set forth his ideas concerning the relationship that should ex- ist between Union C<Jllege and the Greek letter societies. Communications GCip Dr. 1\llartin emphasized that in the past, communication be- tween the fraternities and him- self had been very indirect. There were ti«ually two inter- mediaries ~ the fraternities spoke to Dean Pollock, who spoke to Dean Lockwood, who relayed the message to Martin. The president hopes to estab- lish more direct lines of com- munications so as to pave the way for the arrival of the new Dean of Students next Fall. Mar- tin and Dean Olton are planning to hold small discussion groups with the fraternity presidents. during the first two weeks of March, following dinner at Dr. Martin's home. Following these meetings, .Dr. Martin will state his views on fraternities and Union, which wil.l appear as an article in this column. Topics The topics of discussion at the meetings !Ire Ukely to fol- low the general line established at the initial meeting: In what direction is the College rroving? -Are the fraternities helping or hindering this movement? Martin posed the question, \Do the fraternities. act in a manner that is incansistent or incom- patible with the aims of the Co'llege?\ Moving Ahead Dr. Martin feels that Union is moving ahead. ln the up- coming discussions he hopes to \establish some agreement as to what the fraternities can do to contribute not only to the individual, but also to the tone of life at Union.\ In the past he has said that \if fraternities die at Union, it will be suicide, not murder.\ He again empha- sized that the future of fraterni- ties lies in their own hands. For the second tirne in two years, a sclucluled Union Col- lege Winter- Week:end ·concert did not hapiPen. The S<llll Sur- vivors, contr-acted t() :perform at the Saturday night ·concert, did not appear: at the scheduted 8:30 performa11ce- in Metnori.ar Chap- el. The So11L.Survivors performed Saturday afternoon at the Uni- versity of Vermont as ,part of the \Cakewalk:\ beld there last week. TheY\ were rep()rledly ejected fr:orn the stage during their perf(Jr:lllance for removing their clothi!lg. The group arrived on <!atnpus at about ro:30 P.M. Saturday night and wen1; to President Martin's bouse. It is not known where the ;group 'We-nt from there. The Roosters, a rock group wh<> were playing at Psi Upsilon Fraternity, w.ere hired to play for o!le·half lto\UF to fill in time waiting for tile arrival of the Soul Survivo;rs. At 9:45 P.M. the concert -was officially cancelled. 1Jp until that mo- ment, it was ex:}leded that the group wo11ld .arrive and the con- cert would go on. Last year, the Winter Week- end concert was to have fea- tured Chad and Jeremy, popu- lar felk: duo. The concert was can~elled when Chad came down with a sore throat. Warner Fund Will Continue Brad Craig Tuesday told Concmdiensis that the Rock Warner Educational Fund Drive, originally scheduled to end Winter Weekend, will con- tinue for at least another week. Craig is treasurer of the drive to help bring Robert Warner, a Union junior injured last surnmer in an automobile acci- dent, back to school by spring, 1959. He said that more than $2,()00 has been raised in the past two week:s. Last week, Phi Gamma Delta pledged $150 and Delta Chi and Beta Theta Pi pledged whatever the individual members of the houses contribute. Flood Replaces Ketz • • • Among the activities planned to help the drive this week are a ~ar wash at the service sta- thn on the corner of State St. a11d Brandywine this Saturday from .!} a.m. to 5 p.m. Continued from Page 1 According to Dea11 Lockwood, the ehoice of Mr. Flood came about after the consideration of three questions. Should a re- placement be made in the de- partment at this time? If so, should the college stay within the athletic staff t() find a re- placement or if it deemed neces- sary should the college look to the outside for a new man? Thirdly, if the college decided to stay within the sta:ff who was best qualified to assume the position? Smooth Changeover Realizing that Ketz would be retiring in 1971 it was decided for two reasons to have him step down in September 1969. A new director taking the position two years before Mr. Ketz's departure from the college will be able to consult with Ketz's on administrative problems for that period, therefore expediting the changeover. Ketz stated that when he took <>ver in 1954 the lack of a changeover period made the task very difficult for him. New Post Ketz's new position, Director of Institutional Research, will be very important to the college. Though the exact details of his new position have not been an- nounced, it is expected that Ketz will set up a department to do research for the growing num- ber of federal and state ques- tionaires that the college must process. T~e work is currently carried out by Dean Lockwood's office. Having decided to make a replacement it was decided that the appointment would come from within the staff because administration and trustees be- lieved that a person of sufficient talent could be found within the department. Flood Number One The administration and the trustees reviewed the capacities of the moe:tlllllers of the st:aff and chose Mr. J.e'l()Od as .their number one candid:.ate. Dean L()ckwood stressed M:r, Flood'.;S ability to handle administrative work, to work with persons in aU lll'eas~ and to p•xesent a go~d image ot the colleg~. As far as could be learned, no one else b the de- partment ~as offered the job or was exclufed from thoe runnintt because of an imrnme:nt depart- ure from tile department. To date, more than $250 has been raised in donations from individuals, about half coming from freshmen and the other half from independents. The donations collected dur- ing the past week add to $1,000 pledged by Delta Phi fraternity, $Z50 .pledged by Chi Psi, $100 plus eontributions from broth- er-s of Phi Epsilon Pi and ap, of:fer by Phi Sigma Delta to match contributions of individ- ual members. Campus Ae1ion 'Group Greets Dow Union~s Dewly organized Cam- pus Action CommitteE planned a cool :reception t:his morning for Dow t!hemical Company. A group of more- than 25 students aild a professor met in Social S-cience 16 ~esday even- ing at 8:80 to discass setting up a picB:et line irt front of Wells House to protest Dow's productioll. of n~plan and its exclusiV-(l contract with the U.S. Governrneillt for use of the burn- ing jelly Ln VietnaDI. A corntnittee spokesman said the protes.t was originally to be in the form of questiolls put to the Dow represEtLtatives from noon to 2 p.m. tod.ay~ when the c~mpany is free from inter- views. The campus representatives decided to begin in the morn- ill.g when the interviews are scheduled to begin. The re- cruiter was booked solid with intexviews of Union's chemistry tnajors f<>r two hours. The protest was expected to involve signs with burnt babies and .the group planned to enter Wells House to disrupt the in- terviews. OrganiZed during the fall term last year, the committee is headed by Eugene Kokot, Alan Cohen, Richard Balagur, Alan Z:iegler and Peter Drotman. 3 R::>bert Frost as depicted in exhibit of 27 portrait photos of famous persons by world-famous photographer Yousuf Karsh. ,Exhibit, presented by Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Com- pany, is being displayed at the Music Room '.)f Schaeffer Library on the Union ·campus, February 22-28 .

Twenty-seven photographic portraits of famous persons by world-renowned photographer Yousuf Karsh will be exhibited at Union College, in the Music Room of Schaffer Library from February 22-28, sponsored by Northwestern Mutual Life In· surance Co. of Milwaukee, Wis. The series of r>hotos - selec- ted pers<>nally by Karsh for t!J.e exhibit - is entitled \portraits of greatness.\ Persons repre- sented include Sir Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, Pablo Casals, Ernest Hemingway, Mar- ian Anderson, Albert Schweit- zer Jawaharlal Nehru, Pope John XXIII, Pablo Picasso and Mary Martin. Among the highlights of the exhibit are a photo of Casals made in a Fl\ench abbey while he was playing his cello; a photo of Jean Paul Riopelle, French painter and sculptor, made in his studio, with dramatic light- ing and composition; and the famed portrait of Churchill which pictures him as the tow- ering figure he was, with his character showing in every light and shadow. Karsh not only photographs his subjects, but also interviews them as they sit for their por- traits. A report of his impres- sions of his subjects has been reprinted and will be distributed to visitors at the exhibit. latter research members CAMPUS MISCELLANY He said the relationship be- tween portrait photographer .an~ sitter must be a close and mti- mate one - not altogether un- like that of physician and pa- tient. For the photographer with sympathy, with the \right cam- era manner,\ the sitter will bare his soul, as a patient un- burdens his problems in a trust- ed doctor's consulting room.

Karsh was born in Mardin, Armenia-in-Turkey, on Decem- ber 23, 1908, and grew up un9-er the horrors of the Armeman massacres. He came to Canada in 1924, and after brief shf!ol- ing in Sherbrooke, Que., studied photography for three. years in Boston, Mass. 1 with the famed portraitist, Jonn H. Garo. In 1932, Karsh opened his present studio in Ottawa, Ont. As his work became better known, members of the govern- ment, visiting statesmen, and other dignitaries came to him to be photographed. In December, 1941, Winst<>n Churchill, then prime minister of Great Britain, spoke before the combined houses of the Canadian parlia- ment and was afterwards photo- graphed by Karsh. Publication of the Churchill portrait brought Kirsh into international prom- inence.

N ()rman J()}u.uon I nave been on the Council longer than any other current members so I have probably been disappointed more than any of the others. In my three years I have seen the Council fail to act on everything from adopting a Vietnamese war or- phan (this was felt to be \tak- ing a stand,\ although I could never f1gure out what \stand\ it would have been taking) to endorsing the secrecy and clos- ed meetmgs of the All College Council, (which even the All College Council eventually had the wisdom to seP. was wrong). I think the current adn' inis- tration of the Council, v. hich backed both proposals mentmn- ed earlier, is trying to move in the right direction.

The Council shov.re-d~ that it isa 't bias- ed only towav~ indifferenee to national issues. by also failing to take a position .of leadership on the important campus issue of convocations. Quite consist- ently, it deciclecl to endorse the ' status quo, wmds quite hoLy in Council circles. I agree most strongly with the Concordy editorial which suggested that the Council be disbanded if the IT.embers can't find a use for therr:selves. In- stead of the verbal wrestling that goes on in the Council con- cerning the annual constitu- tional revis:.ons, perhaps the Council can find it feasable to assume a position of leadership on campus.

Playing It Cool The visit to the campus last week of Allen Ginsberg brought the nationwide campus drug controversy into focus at Union. Ginsberg was outspoken in advocating the t:se of marijuana and psychedelic drugs here and through- Som11 ·say we s.!)ecialize in puwer ••• power 1or proplllsion ••• power for auxiliary systems . I. power ,for aircraft, missiles and spe~ce vehicles •• I power for mni11a and industrial applications ••• out society. Up to the present, little has been said of the use of c.lrugs on campus. We know it goes on, but as of yet, the ese is restricted to a rather small group of students, and they are careful enough not to advertise their usage of drugs. Within this context, Union h:;~ considered herse~f relatively free of the \drug problem. We hope that this distinction is not soon lost. The recent raids at Stony Brook point to what can . appen to Union if she goes for large s~ale a~tificial mind- 1 expanding. We deplore the gestapo tactics which were used, ~\t Stony Brook. Arriving on campus unannounced at 5:00' ~ ,.M and barging into students rooms is vaguely reminiscent cf the stories of Stalinist Russia. Nevertheless, students ;:.mst remember that this could happen here. The threat to the college student is greater than ever l.::efore. If he protests the draft to.o loudly, he is re-class- ified (with the help of a file on his protest activities com- l)iled by the FBI). If he smokes marijuana, he may be sent t:.) jail for thirty years (a clear case of excessiv.e punish-' ment). There is a distinct danger that colleges may soon Lecome police states, full of cowering students afraid to tluestion the law and society. When this happens, coll'eges of any value will have ceased to exist. To some extent the student today is sealing his own fo..te. Widespread lawlessness on campus or elsewhere can itOt be tolerated in any society for long. Students have an cbligation to society (and to future students) to leave society a little better than they found it. If we leave it paranoid, looking under every college rug for a marijuana joint or singed draft card, we do neither ourselves nor · iuture students a service. Moderation and patience are cften hardest for students to practice. We deplore the use of drugs on this campus by any member of the college community. This is a type of selfish- ness and irresponsibility which jeopardizes the freedom and quality education of the entire student body. One may argue that the laws are unjust and restrain freedom them- :..elves, but the greater threat to the college community comes from those who choose to flaunt the laws in the name of \college students'', than the laws themselves. b saying this, we support the coll€ge's stand forbidding tne use of drugs on campus. It may be a hard decision to swallow, but at least you won't be awakened by a fanatic \narco\ dragging you out of bed at 5 :00 AM. Dangerous Business Students should be aware of the dangers of doing business with the local Holiday Inn. If the Inn chooses to set personal moral codes for its c;uests, as it appears to be doing, it should set them for dl its guests and not a few select ones from Union College.

Independent Protest To the Editor: I walked into the Fox House Lounge Sunday morning, and saw several fraternity me[)_ asleep there, and the lounge ia a general state of disarray (broken lamp, bottles of beer, broken plants, and a good deal of plain old filth). I was qu,te angry with what I saw, and drew up the fol1owing letter: ·:-.: I circulated it personally .through Fox House for a period of two hours Sunday and Mon- day. It was signed by over 100 residents of Fox, including the Presidents (past and present) of the UIC, four resident ad- visors and members of six dif- ferent fl:aternities~ Some peo- ple did not agree with parts Continued on Page 5 It might be said, instead, that we specialize in people, for we believe that people are a most important reason for our company's success. We act on that belief. We select our engineers and scientists carefully. Motivate them well. Give them the equipment and facilities only a leader can provide. Offer them company-paid, graduate-education opportunities. Encourage them to push into fields that have not been e><plored before. Keep them reaching for a little bit more responsibility than they can manage. Reward them well wllen they do manage it.

Also, £or the f1rst time, a one-act play will be presented, \Krapp!s Last Tape,\ starring junior Jeff De- Munn. . ns unexpected popularity has presented at least. one major J..roblem for the North End, however'--that of space. Most evenings there have ·been stand- lug-room-only crowds at vari- ous pomts in the performances; an unaccomodab.e crowd of over 125 people lined the corri- dors and stairs during Gms- be.rg~s poetry readings. \We are hopmg we can fmd a larger room,\ '!'albert said. But he noted that, as long as space did not develop mto too acute a problem, he was ··very satis- ued'' w1th the present mcatwn. Foreign Students Another recently formed cam- ru;; group is the International Student Organization, already 18 Union students strom~ and still growing. Although its charter was ratified by the Student Council only two weeks ago, the group already has chosen officers, planned regu- lar activities, established head- quarters in Bronner House, and thrown a major party. \The purpose of our organi- zation is mostly of a social na- ture,\ stated Victor Hungerbuh- !er, a senior physics major from Switzerland who plans to attend graduate school here. \If you are an independent and at the same time a foreign student, you feel particularly alone,\ he explained.

He said that the half-century-old building would be extended and remodeled, with dining facilities, recreation halls, club rooms and other fea- tures available to Union stud- ents.

Burt Yankiver ; By GARY PREVOST Garnet cage· teams of the past three seasons have lacked con· sistency in almost every respect except one: The Dutchmen are a fak bet to win at home, but you had better get points if you bet on them away from home. The following figures show why: 1967-68 1966-67 1~65-66 Total Home Away 8-8 * 5;2. 3-6 9-11 8-3 1-8 7-11\' 5-4 2-7 ~'Tourney ex.cluded Tuesday he scored 25 points as Trinity dumped the Dutch- men, hitting on 11 of 17 from the floor. Tad Knight shattered the £rosh 200 free· style record, as he swam it . in 1:56.4. John Horwath, posted a record 1.0g.9 in the : 100 breaststroke. Union's Larry Ray won th.e 100-yard freesty:e in 54.9 after Bob Szatrowski captured the 100- yard fly in 59.2. :Bruce Gar- ber and Mike Gow placed , first and third respectively in the 200-yard individual med:ey. Mike Rone won the , diving, accumulating 170.85 points. The frosh relay teams took both the 200-yard rr.ed:ey and the 400-yard freestyle. The times were 1:50.5 and 3:41.2 respective· ly. Last year the discrepency was the most obvious. The only road victory came at RPI where I believe tnahy of the factors in road defeats are not preval· ent. On the road last year the Garnet managed to lose to five opponents who had losing records on the season, including two very poor teams-Drew and Harpur. Though only one of the teams the Garnet defeated in the Fieldhouse had a winning record, the Dutchmen defeated all of the teams which came in- to the Fie!dh.ouse with losing records. Basketball • • Continued from Page 8 Panthers worked for one shot but Knight blocked the attempt from the corner with two sec- left, and then b~ocked another at the buzzer after an in-bounds pass play nearly worked. The loss extended the anthers losing streak to 24. Jeff Kirkpatrick enjoyed the best night of his career, scoring 19 points on 9 of 16 from the floor. Turner added 15 and pulled down a game high of 13 rebounds. The Garnet had a good shooting night, making 14 ·of 24 in the second half and shooting 49% for the game. Horrible Shooting At Trinity the boo psters fell victim to a horrible shooting :night. Knight's 25 points on 11-17 from the floor was the only bright light for the Gar- net, who hit on only 23 of 64 from the field. Union played its slowdown game for the first six minutes, and led at that point 9-6. Trin- ity then ran off 18 points while the Garnet scored only four. The halftime tally was 32-23. One big problem was Fitz Turn· er's foul trouble, as he played · only about half the game, and still managed 17 rehounds. Union Rallies Early in the second half Un- • ion rallied to trail by only 35-31 ' with five minutes gon.e. They further cut the Bantam's lead until the Garnet trailed by 2, 45-43 with 8 :30 remaining. Trinity then hit their next five shots from the field to spurt to a 554:3 lead, and it was all over. The Garnet rallied once , more to trail by only four, but six of six foul shots by Trinity in the last minute put the lid on the victory, their third in 17 games. Jim Stlih.lman led • the victors with 27 }loints. Close at Rochester Saturday night the hoopsters travel to Rochester to take on a very formidable opponent in ' this year's finale. 'J!he Yellow- jackets stand at 11-5, with a schedule much more difficult than ours. , . .,--------------a SCOREBOARD & SCHEDULE THIS WEEK'S GAMES Wrestling Saturday: Union ~t Colgate Basketball Saturday: Union (V and· f.) at Roche~ter Swimming Friday: Union (V and F) at RPI Track Saturday: Union !Y and F) at Roches· ter LAST WEEK~S RESlJLTS Wrestling Union 29 St. Lawrence 6 Union 29 Clarson 5 .,.

In 1965-66 the Garnet's only road victories came against two of the Garnet's perenially weak- est <opponents, Middlebury and :::.tevens. Reason for such a pattern are not as easy to find. ·In college basketball the home court is said to be worth about ten points due to a combination of unruly hometown fans, \hom- er\ referees, unfamiliarity with the court, and the effect of travel.. I feel that the last two factors aL\\e the most important in explaining Garnet victories at home and losses on the road. The factor of hometown crowds is negligible in Union games because the crowd, though often abusive, is never really large enough to truly have an effect on the players as a crowd of 8,000 in the Palestra in Phila- delphia might have. Refereeing may have a slight .effect on the home and away discrepancy, but a study of total fouls one of the best indicators does not bear this out. At home this year the Garnet have been call- ed for 172 fouls against 147 for the opposition. On the road the Garnet have committed 141 with 122 by the opposition. Capital District referees, how- ever, are considered to call a looser game than in most areas, a definite help to the tough man to man which this year's Garnet employ. ........ The Memorial Fieldhouse · court works to the advantage of the Garnet because of its lack of firmness and its rela- tion to the rest of the building. The temporary floor, with its many \dead\ spots, can be very perplexing for the opposition as is th.e feeling created by the immenseness of the building compared to the size of the court. Away fFom home the Garnet encounter some odd gymnasiums including a cement floor at Alfred, one with wood- en backboards at Stevens, and a cozy fifty-foot court at St. Lawrence, which have at times affected Garnet play in one manner or· another. Like all schools at our level of competition the team travels by !bus to away games on the day of the game. The effect of the bus ride in cramping a player's legs, and tiring him out may be the greatest single fac- tor working against the travel- ing team. On road trips (more than one game) the normal practice of a night game follow- ed by an afternoon game us- ually doesn't have a good effect upon the players either. Buy a Plane One solution, if costs were not prohibitive, would be for the college to purchase a plane, since Coach Schmid is a regis- tered pilot. Since money rules this out, another solution will have to be found, or we will have to be satisfied with .500 basketball teams.

The unbeaten .frosh stretched thek streak ' to five by taking their Trin- ; ity op}:onents 61-33. · The Varsity meet on Sat urday was dominated by the Garnet. Union captured all 12 events while taking 5 run- nerup finishes. The Union effort was paced by three doub!e wins. Co-captains Dick Amesbury and Dick Corrigan contributed a pair · each, as did Dave Seward. Norm Dovberg won the 200- yard breaststroke, while Tom Flynn and Eric Chers\n fin i!'hed 1-2 in the 1000-yard freestyle. Harvey Richmond . took the diving with 163.4 points. The 400-yard med- ley relay team won in 4:11.3, while the 400-yard freestyle relay finished first in 4:05.4. The Varsity meet Wednes- day against Trinity proved to be a very difficult win for the Garnet, as Trinity ran up a 24-11 lead at the end of the first four events. How- . ever, Steve Werlin's record breaking 2:12.6 in the 200 fly and Corrigan's first place Continued on Page 7 '71 Overpowered; Lose 2 On Road The freshman basketball team staggered through a dismal week, dropping two games; losing 90-68 to Middlebury on Saturday and Trinity on Tuesday by a 92-61 count. Coach Garry Brown's q_uintet opened up the Middlebury con- test with solid basketball. At the end of five minutes of play the Garnet were even 11-11 with the aggressive Panthers. Middlebury then opened up a commanding 32-17 lead over the next four minutes, as their press bothered Union and their outside shooting was over the 50% mark. Dave Shames put in 11 points in the first half, but got into deep foul trouble, as did the Garnet's leading scorer, Barry Fitz- gerald. By the half the score was 51-33 and any hope of an upset was disipated when Shames left the game on fouls with 12 minutes left. Fitzgerald, despite the fact that he missed almost half of the game, was high for Union with 22, including 8-9 from the charity line. Shames added 15 from the floor in the first half. Middlebury was 17-34, and 17-24 from the foul line. The Panthers sat on their lead throughout the second half, forcing Union to foul, netting 15 of 20 free throow attempts. Garnet basketball fortunes for the Trinity game suffered a severe blow when four players were struck by illness, including three starters. Center Bob Berger, and guards Guy Bartle and Jay Joseph were the starters involved, the fourth player being Ed Starbuck who is Berger's backup man. Joseph came down with a mild case of mono while Bartle, who was injured in the Siena game is now also ill. The Garnet would have been heavy under- dogs at full strength, as they journeyed to Hartford to face a Trinity team which had lost only once this season, to A,mperst, the posses of a 13-1 mark including wins over Harvard and Yale. The final was 92-61 as the Bantams displayed an extremely effective fast break. The Garnet were crushed by 40-80 shooting and over- powered off of both boards; they were outrebounded by a 62-36 margin, With Berger sidelined the Ga,rnet were at a loss to cope with the 6'7\ Trinity center. Barry Fitzgerald led the Garnet at- tack with 19, and backcourt ace Shames collected 15.

They now stand at l:i-11, and close their season ::iatur<lay visiting power- tul ochester. The Garnet victories over Clarkson and Middlebury were quite similar as the cagers led tor a greater part of both ball games, but had to hang on for one point victories due to a poor effort at the charity stripe m the waning seconds. Against the Golden Knights of Clarkson the Garnet jumped to a 33-24 halftime lead behind Fitz Turner's 11 points and nine rebounds, and a poor all-around effort by Clarkson. However, Clarkson's good second half shooting ( 15 of 24) and the Gar- net's .poor ball-handling and shooting ( ~ of 23) made it a close contest. Clarkson never led but tied tlie Garnet twice at 46 and 48_ With five min- utes remaining a pair of key hoops by Tad Knight and three free throws by Barry Katzman gave the Gamet a seemingly t;vmfortab!e 56-51 lead with 42 seconds remaining. However, the Golden Knights got within one point with ten seconds left when the <Jarnet were unable to cash in on a pair of one and one attempts at the free throw line. Kirkpatrick also missed from the line with three sec- onds but Clarkson was unable to get off a last second shot. TurneF Shines Turner finished with 18 points and 18 rebounds, his best effort of the year, while Tad Knight added 16 points and seven rebounds. Jeff Kirkpat- rick did a fine· defensive job on Clarkson's 20 point average 1 man, Russ Hall, holding him to just two points in the first half a11d 16 in the game. At Middlebury Saturday night the Dutchmen fought a tough see-saw game with a Panther team which had lost 23 games in a row, 17 this season. Tad Knight's fine defensive efforts in the final seconds saved the game. The lead changed hands 10 times in the first half with the 11 Garnet grabbing a 32-31 lead on a driving layup by Kirkpat- rick at the buzzer. During the first half the cagers were es- pecially confounded by a com- bination defense which result- ed in many turnovers and forc- ed long shots. Bill Priscott came off the bench to score nine quick points with four long hoops to keep the Garnet in the running.

Matmen Unbeaten; Pin Colgate, 19-12 By HENRY FEIN Topping an outstanding season with a 19-12 triumph over Colgate Satur- day the Union College wrestling team became the first varsity squad to post an undefeated season record since 1955. The grapplers' 10-0 record also mru:ks the first unblemished season for a Garnet wrestling squad in the twelve years of varsity competition. The Colgate match, fought in front of a largely Garnet crowd at Hamil- ton, New York, lived up to forecasts as the grapplers' toughest challenge of the season. The Red Raiders are_ a perennial wrestling power, and despite a 6-6 season slate proved rough in all weight classes. . Perhaps the biggest surprises Sat- urday were the outstanding perform- ances in the 152 and 160 classes by Leigh Frye and Dick Rosener. :Both had been wrestling fairly well, but had nevertheless been the biggest question marks on the squad. Leigh took a key 10-2 decision at 152 to open up an 11-6 Garnet lead. Rosener W()n his match by a close 4-2 to put Union on the road to victory. Phone Co. Investigates Phonies As expected, Bill Munno got the Garnet . rolling, as he posted an easy 4-1 decision over Pete Achilles. Bill scored an escape in the second period and a takedown in the third to put the match away. Frank D' Antuono, who was unbeat- en going into Saturday's contest, lost a 7-2 decision to Colgate's Bob Raiber. The Red Raider grappler finished the season with only one loss against such competition as Princeton, Springfield, and Rutgers. D'Antuono's loss made the score 3-3, and hurt the aforemen- tioned Garnet plans. Ron Iannotti pulled Union ahead with an important 137 pin in 6:15. Leading all the way, Ron near,pinned his Colgate foe early in the third- period before scoring the pin. Tom Tripp put his three-year un- defeated skein on the line against Mike Shapiro, one of the Red Raider's toughest competitors. Fighting a con- sistently strong match, Shapiro wore down Tripp in all three periods to score a 6-0 decision. The total score tightened to 8-6, the closest Colgate came to the Garnet afteJ.\ Iannotti's triumph. Frye's 152 victory came over Mike Shapiro's twin brother Mark. Leigh took a commanding lead, as he scored an early predicament, and a reversal and near-pin in the second stanza to .move to a 9-1 bulge. Rosener's 160 contest was tight most of the way. The score at the end of the second period was 2-1 in Dick's favor. He had also ammassed a 2:37 riding time lead over Colgate's AI De Jong. This was almost all dissi- pated in the final stanza, however' Continued on Page 6 Martin Joins Educators In Protesting Grad Draft Gy RICIIAU.D PATTERSON President Harold C. I\iartin l:as joined otrer University pres- idents across tre country in a telegram and letter campaign to Congress strongly suggesting it act to \prevent the seriously damaging effects that wil:l ensue from tre graduate deferment plan recently announced py tl-:.e Selective Service System. The telegrams and letters were addressed to Rep. Edith Green, D-Oregon, Chairman of the House Committee on Special Ed- ucation. The object of their com- munications was the recent an- nouncement by the national se- curity council that draft defer- ments for an graduate students except those in medicine, will no longer be granted. Martin said that a large num- ber of University Presidents from a:ll over the country sent similar telegrams and letters asking Rep. Green to argue in the House for a different defer- ment plan that would distribute draft calls over all age groups available for the draft in propor- tion to the number in each age group, and to the total draft call at the time. This would be a change from the present system which. takes all the available old- est students first and works down tt e age gro1:1ps. ''This system,\ Martin said, \will save the nation's needs ~ts well as any other system, and it will prevent damaging evacua- tioa of graduate and professional school entering classes. Univer- sities can operate with the re- ductions such a pooling system would prodw.:c but they will suf- fer unneccessary hardships if en- rollments in entering classes for next year (and who knows how many more?) drop to a quarter or even half the size for which they are staffed and on which they rely for present and future professional services.\ Discipline Committee Acts Before Protest Protest Guideline Developed In response to the threat of student demonstrations against the Dow Chem- ical recruiter last Thursday, the Dis- cipline Committee met Wednesday night, February 21, to establish guide- lines for protecting academic freedom on campus. The committee decided that the only \freedom\ worth defending on the campus is academic freenom. In the words of Dean of Students Char- les S. Olton this means, a \free flow of ideas, dialogue and debate, or dis- course.\ These things can only take place, Olton said, in an atmosphere of freedom. Anyone who prevents an interchange of ideas violates academic freedom, Olton said. Olton stated that the discipline committee felt that academic freedom protected both the students' right to talk with the Dow recruiter, and to protest his presence, but \if any stu- dent had prevented access or egress to the building, he would be violating academic freedom.\ The Discipline Committee's decision was to give students maximum free- dom to express themselves. If, how- ever, students violate the principle of academic freedom, three steps will then be taken. First an officer of the college would request that the stu- dent stop his action. Next, he would be told that if he refuses to stop, he would be subject to action by the Discipline Committee. If the student still refuses to stop, he will be told to leave or be suspended. 30 Students P:icket Dow Recrui.ter The Campus Action Committee ex- pressed is displeasure at the presence of a recruiter from Dow Chemical on campus Thursday. Roughly 30 stu- dents gathered behind Wells House at 10 a.m. with signs and plans for a sit-in demonstration in Wells House. Three campus police, Dean of Stu- dents Charles S. Olton and the regu- lar occupants of Wells House man- ned the locked doors and success- kept C>ut the quiet and orderly dem- onstrators. For tile first time in Union's recent history counter pickets appeared to applaud the effects of Napalm. Eight pickets appeared from the direction of Psi Upsilon carrying signs applaud- ing Napalm as \Neat and Efficient.\ Fifteen counter pickets appeared in the afternoon against the five pro- testers who came to question the Dow representative. The demonstrators made no at- tempts to block students with inter- views inside from entering the build- ing. Earlier leaders of the demonstra~ Continued on Page 4 Parents Will Sponsor Landscaping Drive· A major program of landscaping will refurbish the inner campus as part of a project sponsored by the Parents Association. The parents association has assumed responsibility for raising the funds necessary to finance the project be- cause as Martin S. Coleman, chair- man said, \The new program will pro- vide far more than just frills or convenience. It is an important part of the necessary long-range develop- ment of the college which, by nature, involves changing the face of the camp11s.\ Twenty eight telephone bills from phones in Richmond House and West College made . out to fictitious names were received yesterday at Student A.:tivities. Dean of Students Charles S. Olton said he is sending the bills back to the New York Telep)wne Company so that their special investigators can deal with them. Olton said the investi- gators generally call the number list- ed on the bill and attempt to find out the name of the person who called that number at the time the fictitious name was given. He said investigators are quite effici,ent in tracking down people who do this. Giving a fictitious name to the phQne company for the purpose of evading payment of a bill is :fraud, and .punishable by law. Aaron, Levin Criticize Utopianism Beginning this spring the central campus will be planted with a variety of trees and shrubs in a carefully designed fashion. The plans call for a leveling of the entire area, in the hope that it may be used as an out- door theater for such events as com- mencement. Broad plantings of yew will anchor the colonnades against a background of flowering trees. Im- mediately in front of the library, beds of annuals will provide summer color around a broad plaza. Dr. C. William Huntley, chairman of the fac- ulty committee in charge of the plant- ing, noted that \there will be benches on which people can relax and enjoy the view. They can also stand on them and make speechs.\ Total cost of the plan is presently estimated at $15,000 for planting and $35,000 for grading, walks .and bench- es. The project will be dedicated dur- ing parents weekend on May 3-5. Coleman emphasized that the project was expensive - $40,000 is needed this year - and this means the sup- port ·of every parent is necessary. Al- ready, he said checks have been re- ceived varying in size from $10 to over $1,000. The local office of the New \York TElephone <::ompany tried to calm .stu- dE)nt fears this week that lar~e scale wire·tapping of phones was bemg con- ducted on campus. Rumors and accusations of Vtire- tapping have been circulating on cam- PilS for some time. The New York Telephone Company sent a special in- vestigator to campus to check all sus- PEcted phones, at the request of Dean of Students Cbaries S. Olton. No evidence of wire-tapping was found. Olton said he is certain that the pllone company itself is not tapping. It is a violation of the state penal C()de for any employee of the phone cClmpany to divulge to anyone infor- mation gain~d from telephone con- VErsations. Olton said he did n<>t be- lieve the phone company would run the risks involved in such art action. Less than 60 students, along with about as many townspeople, attended the Founder's Day Convocation Tues- day. The students were enthusiastic; their enthusiasm, however, was not directed so much toward the program as it was toward receiving convoca- tion cards at its conclusie>n. Following the Entrance of the Fac- ulty in their academic robes and the welcoming address by President Mar- tin, Albert P. Bantham, Secretary of the Board. of Trustees, presented bon· orary Doctor of Letters degrees to the two guest speakers, Daniel Aaron and Harry Levin. Daniel Aaron, Jordan Professor of English Language and Literature at Smith College, spoke on Conservative Utopianism. Mr. Aaron's major point was that American projections of the future have repeatedly been .descrip· tio:ns of the present with its unde- sirable qualities removed. Re also stated that the practical implications proposed by utopianists were most important in attracting followers. Harry Levin, Irving Babbit Pro- fessor of Comparative Literature at Harvard University, followed Mr. Aaron with an address on tlle Para· doxes of Utopia. In his address, Mr. Levin substantiated his opening state- ment: \Authority keeps ideal com- monwealths from coming into exist- ence, or existing commonwealths from becoming ideal.\ Before the end of Mr. Levin's ad- dress, several students attempted to leave. They were persuaded to stay to the conclusion of the convocation, however, by the Delphic Society mem- bers, who refused to distribute tickets until that time. Union Faculty in academic procession on way to Founders Day convocation. Since 1961 Union has had a land- scaping program, but this new drive supported by the efforts of the par- ents committee will accelerate the program and make it possible for more to be done. According to Dr. Huntley, \It has to do with pride in the College. Anything. we can do to make it. a more beautiful place has implications that go far beyond the landscaping itself.\ The colle~e's present planting pro- gram had. 1ts origin in less happy events, chiefly the advent of the nor- torious Dutch elm disease in the years immediately after World War II. The disease, arriving at a time when some of Union's elms were al· ready nead the end of their normal life span 1 posed a serious threat to the ph.ys1cal beauty of a campus on which the elms provided natural beauty.

Freedotn For All Concordiensis wishes to commend the Discipline Com- mittee and the Administration for the calm, well considered positi()n taken in regard to student demonstrations on campus. Academic freedom is the one principle on which a college or university stands or falls. ''V'ithout academic fre~dom, there is no debate, no dialogue, no exchange of new, differ- ent, and sometimes upsetting views. Acade~ic freedom is similar to freedom in general. It has two s1des : freedom and responsibility. When students exercise their freedom to spend two days listening to Allen Ginsberg preach the use of LSD (a hotly debated topic), they must also be willing to allow other. students :-vith different views. to carry on a dialogue with a recru1ter from Dow Chemical Co. ·ro refuse to allow students this right is to deny them academic freedom to dissent from your position, and to say, in effect, that no one else deserves academic freedom but you. This position is quite juvenile, and unbecoming to any college stude~t. We recognize t~e right of ~~udents to ex- press their d1ssent from the actions or pos1twns taken by Dow Chemical, but when students of any persuasion at- tempt to disrupt or prevent dialogue, especially with vio- lence they are attacking the foundation on which the college stands, they undermine everyone's right to dissent, and in effect, threaten their own freedom. Thursday, February 29, LETTERS T.helastTraneRun Congrats To the Ed1tor: In regard to Union's recent drive to achieve mediocrity, the administration has just scored another stunning suc- cess with the appointment of George Flood as the school's new athletic director. They shou~d be eongratulated on their wise choice, especially when other well-qualified indi- viduals were available to ac- cept the position. A Disgusted Student Perfect To the Editor: Congratulations to the Ad- ministration for finding the per- fect replacement for Dr. Ketz, a task thought impossible by many. Dick Corrigan '68. Petition To the Editor: The following letter was cir- culated among upper classmen in the past day and a half. Dear Coach Allison, We wish to voice our re- gret that you were not chosen Athletic Director of Union College. We feel your exten· sive experience and inspira· tional leadership have gained you the admiration of the en· tire stadent body. Sincerely yours, 473 Union College Students I feel it is necessary to ac- company this letter with an ex- ,planation of its purpose, so that it will not be misinterpret- ed. Please take it at its face value. Nothing was meant to be read between the lines. It is not a beLittlement of Coach Flood's ability to fill the posi- tion. It is only our attempt to show we feel Coach Allison is the student's choice for the po- sition of Athletic Director. Con· sidering his experience, senior· ity, and other general qualifi- cations, we feel it was rather unjust not to have offered him the job. In any event, we ap- preciate the work Coach Alli- son has done at Union, and we hope he will remain here, Larry Gillette '68. Council maw Replies To the Editor : make other recommendations concerning convocations; its function is not limited to a mere discussion of the requirement. I am sure decisive Council ac- tion will follow the committee's report. Perhaps Mr. Ziegler felt his resignation was justified. But he can do little to improve the Student Council from where he is now. Ed Rundell '71. Dissent! To the Editor: I must take the strongest ob- jection to your most recent edi- torial \Playing It Cool.\ To say · that the college student faces the distinct danger that the col- lege may soon became a police state is no idle chatter. If, how- ever, a student is to be intimi- dated by the fear of being awak- ened at 5 a.m. by a \narco\ rather than inuenced to act in what is the proper manner by rational thought,. this must be considered in the realm of pow- er politics rather than academic freedom. While moderation and patience are fine virtues, per- haps t}le courage to stand for one's rights and beliefs is more important. I cannot in good conscience support any policy that can only justify itself in terms of fear. Richard Balagur, '69.

UYou know that isothermal recrystallization process Dick Klophaus· worked out~ . We have made clear our position previously. Concord- iensis condemns tte use of violence in campus demonstra- tions, and we commend the students for thus far refraining from its use. There is not enough protest and demonstration on this campus. There are many national and campus issues which deserve heated campus debate, but attempts at obstructing debate have no place at Union. As a member of the Student Council, I cannot let Alan Zieg- 'er's letter in last week's Con- cordy go unanswered. While i Mr. Ziegler no doubt regarded his resignation from the Coun- cil as his only honorable altern- ative, I object to his reasoning and feel he has not stated the facts. ,I ' Furthermore, the college has an obligation to protect itself and the right of all students to academic freedom. It is unpleasant to suspend or expel any student, but when a student attacks t.he principle of academic freedom, there is no other choice. The position of the college on this matter will no doubt be a hard one to for some students to swallow, but we hope that they will view it in the context of accepting the responsibility to others that goes with freedom for oneself. What To Do? We regret that some students have chosen to circulate a petition which despite its innocuous wording, serves main- ly to embarrass Coach Flood. It is unfortunate that only by embarrassing Flood after his appointment is final, can ·students voice their opinion of this important decision. If in the futuret students have some opportunity to offer their opinion on such matters, as they have with regard to the appointment of the new Dean of Students, such a situation may be avoided. Mr. Ziegler's primary cr-iti- cism was \the Council's abhor- rent refusal to take a stand on the Vietnamese War.\ Few Council members felt a stand should be taken on this issue within the Council without its debate and consideration by the student body. It is my hope that the Council will sponsor such a campus discussion and then take appropriate action. I can- not help feeling that Mr. Zieg- ler was disappointed because the Student Council did not take a stand which reflected his personal views. He also voiced disagreement with the Council's decision re- , garding convocations. 'the mo- tion passed by the Student Council continues the convoca- tion requirement temporarily, .but established a committee to study the entire convocation system at Union College. There · are now overwhelming indica- tions that the student body fav- ors the dropping of the convo- cation requirement. As a mem- ber of this committee; I plan to advise that such action be tak- en. The group also plans to Mama Bianchi's Fine Italian & American Food Open Sunday Special Tues. & Thurs: A main concern of the students signing the petition is that all efforts be made to assur.e that Coach Allison will not soon be lost to the college. He has proved his value to Union in the time he has been here. We hope that the col\ lege will take. definite stepG soon to assur~ that Allison will· find satisfaction in being at Union for many years more.

While awaiting a reply from RPI, Wood and his crew have been round- ing up materials to build a four by 16-foot plywood :flattop on a frame 6f four-by~fours o-ver eight or ten oil barrels.

He will be on campus Monday and Tuesday as a Danforth Visiting Lec- turer. The topic of his convocation address wHl be \Poetry Now: Tra- dition and Breakthrough.\ The pro- gram is open to the public. The visiting lectt:trers program un- der which Brinnin comes here was initiated in 1957 by the Arts Program of the Association of American Col- leges, and is supported by a grant from the Danforth Foundation. Its purpose is to assist colleges in their efforts to strengthen liberal educa- timJ.. Each year several men and women of outstanding intellectual stature from this country and abroad are made available to colleges and uni- versities. They remain on campus from two days to a week. Gold Medafist MISCELLANY Brinnin was born in Nova Scotia, and was educated at the University of Michigan and Harvard University. Before moving to Bost()n University, where he is professor ()f English, he taught at Vassar College and the University of Connecticut. In 1948 he was a visiting lecturer in California, and poet-in-residence at Stephens College. He was director of the Poetry Center in New York from 1949 to 1956, and received the Gold Medal of the Poetry Society of Amer- ica for \Distinguished Service to Po- etry\.

4 DowDe~no A Call For Action: It!Js Up To Us By PETER J. WEINGOLD The recent attacks by North Vietnamese regular troops and Vietcong guerillas against ma- jor strongholds of the Saigon- Washington go v e r n men t of South Vietnam have served to illustrate a major point of this conflict too often overlooked. The Vietcong forces could not 1 have taken, and held for so 1 long, so many South Vietnamese and American strongholds if there weren't a strong, able, and willing part of the people of South Vietnamese helping them at every step. PFesident Johnson has claim· ed for months now that the population in the cities is over- whelmingly Joyal to the Saigon government. This clearly isn't so. If this is a civil war (and it ' certainly appears to bel and the large majority of South· Viet· namese favor a government rad- ically difl'erent from the present one, what are we, the young people of America doing losing our lives there'? Why are we fighting such a senseless battle that can lead only to more fight· ing on a far greater scale? The answer is that it must be r up to us, as the most involved and the best informed portion of our nation, to let our elected representatives know that our involvement in Vietnam must end. That this cruel and stupid war of American imperialism cannot continue, because we are no longer willing to fight it. Either through a partial with- drawal leading to a negotiated. settlement, or the complete re- moval of all our boys from Viet· nam, it is time the United States gave Vietnam back to the Viet- namese. But what can be done to let the leaders in Washington know how we feel? There are actual- ly three things we can do. The first is to apply electoral pres- sure. This means is completely ~legal and is the best way to get .Jasting changes. It is a s 1 ow process, however, and under the present circumstances, mere elections will bring in new faces but not new actions. Also, al- though those under twenty-one constitute the largest single age group in the armed forces, few states permit them to vote. The second and third means of action are constitutional, though, occasionally not legal through today's interpretation of the Constitution. They are non-violent direct action and civil disobedience. Although the two actions may sometimes turn out to be the same thing, the difference is that non-vio- lent direct action involves us- ually legal means, like marches and rallies, while civil disobed- ience must. by its nature. in- volve the breaking of civil laws while obeying moral ones. The Nuremburg War Crimes Tribunal after World War II established the precedent that individuals are responsible for their actions with respect to the action of their government. The excuse of \just following ord- ers\ is no excuse at all for in- humanity. It is up to us, as the rnorallly right minority, to do what our consciences tell us is right. It is human nature to be afraid of change and to be un- willing to institute actions con- trary to what the majority seemingly wants. Here at Union it is no longer necessary to pro- test alone. With the successful operation of the Campuc; Action Committee now assured Union students have been given the opportunity and the means to voice their displeasure over our government's policy in Vietnam. It is a group of your fellow students who will not sit by and watch genocide being commit- ted without, at least, raising their voices in protest. If your conscience is bothering you be- cause you know something should be done, join us, before it's too late. • • • Sports Shorts \I wanted to work for a small company. It may sound crazy, but that's why I went with IBM!' \When I was in school, I dreaded the th()ught of working for some huge company where I'd be just another number,\ says IBM's Jim Hamil- ton.

In the b()wling finals, the Independ- ents (32-0) will take on D Chi (231f2. 4%). \At the same time, I knew there were definite ad- vantages in working for a large firm. So as. I interviewed each company, I checked in to the degreeof individuality I could expect there. \One of the main reasons I picked IBM was their decentral- ization. They've got over 300 locations throughout the country. Which to me means a big company with. a small-company atmosphere.\ IBM's small team concept \Actually there's plenty of decentralization even within each location. For instance, in science and eJ.1lgineering, they use a small team concept. It means, no matter how large the project, you work individually or as part of a small team-about four or five people. \In marketing, I was pretty much my own boss even before I became a manager. As a systems engineer, it's up to you to find the solution to a customer's problem, and then see it's carried out in the optimum way.

Allison Deserves Sotnething Too An appeal is being made to the students and friends of the Union College wrestling team to raise funds to send wrestlers to the 4-I's tournament at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio March 8-9; As of last week, two mem- bers of the Union College ath- letic department deserved rec- ognition for accomplishments in intercollegiate competition. Both George Flood and Bruce Allison have been successiul to some degree at bettering Un- ion's standing in the hierarchy of college sports. By virtue of his appointment as Director of Athletics, Flood has been recog- nized for his achievements; Al- lison, however, has not. George Flood's biggest con- tribution to Union Co.lege ath- . 1 letics has been in the field of recruiting. He has brought a I significantly higher calibre of football players to campus, and by virtue of this he achieved a 4-4 season with only one senior seeing considerab'e action this past season. All signs point to- ward an outstanding season next fall, possibly even a much desired victory over Williams. success here. Second, he has shown the coaching a~ility to teach the sport to relative new- comers, as each year several key varsity operatives are stu- dents who had never played the game before entering lJ nion. Beyond this, Allison has gained the respect of :nearly everyone with whom he has worked. One could say, with- cut reservation, that he is the most popular member of the ath'.etic department with the student body in general. Ath- letes who have worked with him in lacrosse and freshman foot- ball hold him in the highest esteem. Also, he has wen the respect of his fellow lacrosse coaches, as is indicated by his rosition as a member of the na- tional rules committee, and his recent election to the presidency of the Lacrosse Coaches' AssoCi· ation of America. One cannot take issue wlth the choice of Flood as Director of Athletics. As indicated, Un- ion college athletics shou\d prosper under his control. How- ever, Bruce Allison is now in a position where promotion in the not-too-distant future is unlike- ly. It seems that he too should get some form of recognition for his contributien,s. Possib 1 y this cou1d come in the form of a reemphasis on lacrosse, with the addition of one or more coaches, and an attempt to reach real national prominence, as other small schools such as Johns Hopkins have done. The recognition cou1d also ('Ome in the form of an intermediate po- sition in the athletic depart- ment, below Mr. Flood, but above the role of merely a coach. Bruce Allison deserves this recognition, and without it may be forced to look for an institution Vlhere room for ad- vancement is greater, which would indeed be a great loss to the college. Originally, consideration was given to sending wrestlers to the NCAA small-college cham- pionships in Minnesota, but this was ruled out by Mr. Ketz and it has been decided that the grapplers must go to Ohio, where the Garnet have traveled in the past. Mr. Ketz has stated that it will cost approximately $120 per wrestler for the meet. The Ad- ministration will definitely send one WTestler to Ohio. Between $200 and $250 must be raised to send a second wrestler and around $450 must be raised to send three men. It appears evident that with this sort of recruiting success repeated, the very near future will show the Garnet to be dom- inating their present gridiron rivals, and possibly schedu 1 e \ changes will be made to inc\ude , I more powerful foes, the likes of Wil 1 iams and King's Point, which had previous:y been out of our class. Mermen Tie RPI, Finish 5-3-1 Promising Frosh Close Unbeaten Coach Coleman has said that if one wrestler is sent, it will be senior co-captain Ron Ian- notti, who has been undefeated since losing his first match this year. The second wrestler to make the trip would be sopho- more Bill Munno, who is 8-1 on the season and finished third at the strong C. W. Post tour- nament in December. Naysim Simon, the Garnet's only un- beaten grappler, would be the third representative. The Concordy feels that Union College is shirking its respon- sibilities and overlooking a good chance to give recognition to the school's most improved sport. Understandably, the cost is significant, but it is less than we paid for the privilege of losing three games in the Christ- mas basketball tourney. This attitude of stepped·U:J recruiting has permeated the entire ath!etic staff, and the long-term trend is toward win- ning teams-especially in swim- ming, wrestling, track, and soc- cer. George Flood, as the man at the top, will build Union into what many of us wou~d Uke to see; that is, a school well repre- sented in all sports, and out- standing in at least a few. Bruce Allison has also made his mark in Union College ath- letics, but on a broader base. He has built lacrosse into a power- ' ful sport, and the Garnet now have to be ranked as one of the top eastern powers in the sport. This has, been accomplished in several ways. First, Allison also recruits well. He has brought outstanding high school lacrosse players to Union, and they have contributed much to the sport's Announcements All varsity baseball candid' dates should be present at a general meeting on 1\londay, March 4. at 2:30 in the Field House.

The unde- feated Union freshmen remain- ed that way by deaHng the R.P.I. frosh a ctushing 65 to 26 defeat. W erlin, swam the 200 yard butterfly in the new Union yard course in the new Union College and R.P.I. pool record of 2:10.4. This was a full 1.6 seconds under the Union school record he set at Williams on January 27, and 2.6 seconds un- der the Foote pool record he established against Trinity last weekend. However, this time may not be good enough to en· able Werlin to go to the Na- tionals in March. According to coach Bob Benson Werlin must get his time down to at least 2:08 this upcoming Saturday in the New York State champion- shirs at Hobart, otherwise it wouldn't be economicai'y rea- sonable for the school to sup- port him at the Nationals. Werlin was not the only Gar- net record breaker against R.P.I. Tom Flynn set a new Union school record in the 1000 yard freestyle in the time of 12:10.2. Following Flynn's win, co-cap- tain Dick Amesbury scored a douh'e win in the 200 and 500 yd. freestyles. Dick Corrigan, FERRO PHARMACY 575 Nott Street Schenectady, N. Y.

The Freshman meet was again dominated by Union. Frosh stalwart Burt Yankiver paced the young Garnet's by setting two new Union College fresh- man records in the 200 yard freestyle 1:56.2 and the 100 yard freestyle 52.8 events. Union's Bruce Garber gave an all out effort to win the individ- ual medley event in 2:18.6.

After two games, the team's tallest two players, Jim Derrick and Rich Heiden were declared academically in- eligible. Joe James, a star of the fresh- man team two years ago, joined the varsity for the Christmas tournament, and seemed' to be rc unding into form, ;J>ut he with- drew from further competition at the beginning of the new semest~r. for personal reasons. Bill Neidel, the Garnet's only double .figure score!' after four- teen games, suffered a cracked shoulder bone while skiing and missed the season's final six games. The varsity's prol>lems cent- ered around the team's lack of outside shooting, and lack of overall team speed. The back- court took almost half the shots, but scored only about one-third of the points. The guards cum- ulatively hit 337r from the field. Of the guards who played sig- nificantly on 1 y Jeff Kirkl)atrick, with 43'lr- hit consistently from the field. Unable to play run-and-shoot basketball, the Garnet had to rely on deliberate defensive game to keep the score close, and hope to win the close games, as they did in six of their eight victories. Kirkpatrick, Craig Carlson and Tad Knight must be commended for their consist- ently .fine defensive efforts. The cagers managed to hold several hig!). scoring individuals well be- low their seasonal averages. Neidel led the scoring with 13.3 per game, and provided the Garnet with its best outside shooting. Knight, earning a starting position in the fifth game, finished second in scoring and in rebounding. He averaged 9.4 points per game and shot a phenomenal 59:2\/r from the fio()r, to lead the team in that department for the second sea- son in a row. Senior Fitz Turner led the team in rebounding with 10.5 per game, and played especially well in the final six games of the season.

With only six seconds left in the contest, Dick finally man- aged to reverse the Red Raider and put the match away. Once again, Naysim Simon scored the clincher for the Gar- net by .pinning a tough foe in dramatic fashion. Colgate's Len Berkey carne close to taking Naysim down in the first period, but Simon managed to fight his way out of bounds. Starting the second per-iod \down Simon fought to 1:everse Berkey for the first half-Ininute of the stanza. Once he succeeded, Naysim made it look easy. Before put- ting Ber.keY\' away for good, Nay- sim scored a near-pin, and quick- ly ended tile match. The time was 3:43. Barry <JC>rnwall lost a heart- breaking 3-0 decision at 177. Reversed midway through the second per-iod, Barry was un- able to regain control, and lost an additional point on riding time. Frank Fusick came out on the short ·end of a 8-2 decision to Colgate's heavyweight, Gene Detweiler. The Red Raider led all the wa:y, and totalled 5:48 in riding time.

By (lAR.Y PREVOST Dropping a hard fought 69-61 decision at the hands of strong University of Rochester team Saturday, the Gar~e~ cagers fin- ished a d.isappomtmg season with an 8-12 mark. . The Dutchmen used a delib- erate offense and a rough mar.- to-man .in an attempt to stay with the 12·5 Rochester squad, which had already accepted a bid to tile NCAA small college tourney, With some good first half shooting Union trailed by only five, 36-31 at the half, but a late spurt by 6-3 Yellowjacket guard Pierce Baker (9 of 11 from the floor) sent Rochester into a lead it never relinquished. With the Garnet extremely cold from the floor in the sec- ond half Rochester raced to a 63-46 lead v:ith five minutes re- rr.aining before a spirited Gar- net rally cut the margin to 67- 61. The Garnet ran out of time however, and a disappointin\ seas?n ended on a losing note.\ . Chff Feldman, who s:umped m ~he second half of the season, fi_mshed strong scoring 20, hit- h!lg on 9 of 15 from the tloor. F1tz Turner turned in a fine effort, scoring 13, pulling down 19 rebounds, and doing a com- mendable defensive job on the 6-7 Yellowjacket center Dave Taylor. The Garnet cagers started with a squad that could have been expected to finish better than .500, but several develop- ments turned the season around. Pete Garrison, leading scorer on last year's frosh squad, con- tracted mononucleosis late in Continued on Page 5 152 llnd 160 look to be trouble sopts for the Garnet, but Nay- sim Simon is an overwhelming favorite to take the 167 class. His toughest competition will probably come from RPI's AI Hald, whom Simon pinned to c 1 inch the Garnet victory in dual competition. The 177's look wide open, with three gran- piers in the running.

Ten of those seasons were coached by R. Bruce Allison, who stepped down after last season to devote more time to his lacrosse duties. Ron Coleman, Allison's successor, finally solved the Colgate jinx, which foiled the 1967 .squad's bid for an unblemished slate. Wrestling began on a more or les~ informal basis in 1957, as the Garnet posted a 3-1 record under John Mulligan. Allison took the reins in 1958, the first full varsity seasen. Plagued by a lack of depth, the squad finished the year with a 3-7 mark, but looked promising. Coach Allison wisely limited his sg,uad to sop!J.ornores and juniors that first se~son; he felt that his JOb was to ,give the squad as much experience as possible. The policy paid off in the 1959 season, as the Garnet won their last six matches on the way to a 7-3 mark. 1960 was mort! of the same. After a slow start, the grapplers took their last four to finish at 5-4. Coach Allison's squads did not fare as well in the early 1960's, as the level of competition increased. 1961 .saw the wrestlers take only one of eight contests. They bounced back the following year, \.· however, and posted a 5-3 mark./ 1963 was more of the same; though, as the. grapplers again postea a 1-7 mark. 1964. was somewhat better, as the team ended with a 3-6 record. The ICAC tournament began in 1965, and the grapplers showed the power that has been pl\evelant in recent years. Despite, a 2.7 season slate, the Garnet took second to RP'I in the tourney. The 1966 squad returned t() winning ways, losing only two of seven season matches, and once again taking second in !kle ICAC. i. Tourney champs for the Garnet were 'Ron Iannotti at 130 and Barry Cornwall at 167. Last year's wrestling squad was second only to the 196B edition in its performance. GC>ing into the Colgate match with an 8-0 record, the Garnet lost a heartbreaking 18-9 meet. The grapplers bounced back the next week, however, and easily captured the ICAG title from RPI. Tom Tripp, Ron Iannotti and Frank D'Antu- ono all took titles, while four other grapplers made the finals.
