T HE senior class has at last. passed out from the tender care of tutors and is now being in- structed by real, bona-fide professors. .The fact that '86 has had a tutor for seven out of nine terms, and that the new professors have already becot-ne popular, does away with much grumb- ling, and leads us to think that there is sotne '\balm in Gilead\ after all. A COMMITT,EE has been appointed fro111 the Faculty to revise the curriculun1 with a view to abolish n1athernatics after Sophomore year, and to pr~vide a number of electives for Junior and Senior year.. This is a sign of progress and will, without doubt, receive the approval of Alumni and students. Senior year has had a few eleCtives, but in the whole tnatter of elec- tives LT n ion has been behind her sister college~ a nurnber of years. W E ask the indulgence of our subscribers for this· issue on account of the delay and the atnount of stale news W'e chronicle. Much of the material was handed in· sotne time ago, so that in some. cases events anticipated when the material was handed in have happened before the paper appeared. We promise no delay in the future, and will try to present recent news and to avoid anticipation of events which shall take place before the number is issued. W E desire to call the attention of out readers to a subjeCt too apt to be overlooked. The financial support of_our paper comes quite largely from our advertising columns, ne_arly if not quite as much being derived from that source as from the students. Those. advertising with us, no doubt, expect a part at least of our patronage, and as all are worthy of confidence, it is but just that tl1ey should receive it. For it is quite evident that without their aid the paper could not be published ·but at a considerably greater expense to its readers. What we would ask, then, of our students, is this: that they look cat·efully over the names of our advertisers and t-nake it a point to patronize the1n. In faCt, use our advertising columns as a directory, and make our advertisers feel _that in helping us they have not thro,vn away their money. T HE late issue q~ the first nutnber of the CoN- CORDIENSIS every year is due tnostly to the defeCtive syste1n of eleCting editors. The term of office of the board of editors expires with the collegiate year. This necessitates a settle1nent after the comn1encement number has been issued, and consequently all advertisetnents run out then. These must be obtained again in the fol- lowing fall before the first number can be issued, and in addition to this the volume must begin

What we would propose as a retnedy is that the term of office of the editoriaL board expire with the second term of the collegiate year. This would give the · board the experience necessary to produce the first issue of the next volutne ·protnptly, and as all advertisements would begin the year with the · April number there would be no cause for: delay in the following September. All conttaCts should expire and a settlen1ent for the year be tnade at the expiration of the term of office of the board, s.o that the managetnent of one board should not interfere with that of another. Cer- tainly it is, as the 1natter stands now, itnpossible to issue a Septetnber number; indeed, it is usually late in OCtober before the first nutnber can be issued. , this, only six men in the whole college cared enough for the paper to hand in articles for pub- lication. Now, we can get along without ~on­ tributions in the literary line, but we tnust have the subscriptions ; .and while we solicit both, we ask the students ·to re1netnber· that the paper can not subsist on promises, and that ~it is the ''almighty dollar,\ .so to speak, that ''n1akes the tnare go.\ ]\ S an ilnprovement on the tnake-up of last 1:!1_ year's CoNCORDIENSIS, the paper this year vvill be printed with new and smaller type, ordered specially for the purpose, and two pages of reading matter have been substituted for the satne amount of advertisn1ents, thus increasing the amout of reading 1natter by about four pages. Both of these changes are a disadvantage to the editors, and for this reason alone we feel justified in asking for 1nore liberal support. While every- one will allow that we should have a college paper, and will require that paper to b~ a true . exponent of life and spirit at Union, there is little cotnpetition for a position on the board and no attempt to raise the standard of the paper, either by contributing n1atter or by a judicious seleCtion of editors. Now, as there is little or no honor in holding a position on the paper, and as an editor's work is extra and done gratuitiously, it is but a stnall favor to ask every one to give his support by subscribing, and to pay his subscrip- tion in pron1ptly. Perhaps a few faCts on the subjeCt of support given by the undergraduates rna y shed a little light on the subjeCt and answer the purpose of this annual harangue. Last year only two-thirds of the students in college took the paper, and only about two-thirds of this number paid their subscriptions; the rest either refusing to pay at all or claitning that the paper OUR NEW PROF·ESSORS~ U NION has received three very valu~ble addi- tions to her fa·culty this fall. . · . Pr.of~ T. W. Wright has been called to the chair of Physics ( tnade vacant by the resignation of Prof. Chaplin, who has accepted a sitnilar po- sition at Harvard). Prof. Wright is a graduate of the University of Toronto, where he received the degree of A. B. While there he dis- tinguished hin1self in the study of mathetnatics and physics, leading a class of sixty in these ·branches, and receiving a gold tnedal for the highest excellence in thetn. He finished his·ed- ucation at the Sheffield Scientific school in r872, where he re~eived the degree of C. E. For the ten years following he was conneCted with the survey of the western a:nd northwestern lakes, • and at the end of that titne was called to a chair at Lehigh, whence he catne to Union. He has been a valuable contributor to many scientific journals, but his principle work is \A Treatise on the Adjustlnent of Observations with Application to Geodetic Work and Other Meth- ods of Precision.\ This work has received the highest cotntnendation from both English and A1nerican Scientific n1agazines, and has been adopted as a text-book by Colu1nhia College, although intended rather for use in the field. It is a neat octavo volurne of 437 pages, and refleCts great credit on its publishers, ·VanNos- trand & Co. ·Prof. Wright's tnethod. of condu&ing his classes gives the greatest satisfaCtion to the stu- dents under hitn, his particular excellence con- sisting in his exaCtness, his thoroughness and his sitnplification of the difficult.

A Night of Horrors. M. L. P. D URING the winter of 18- I was engaged, in cotnpany with Dr. B . , in preparing tna- . terial for the anatomical rnuseutn of the Y-- Medical College. I was a student of the college, and for the reason that I had shown some .little skill in dissecting, and was an intimate friend of Dr. B , was engaged in this special work. My chum, whom I shall call Steve, was a grad-· uate of the college and an expert in anatotnical work. The work in which we were engaged required a great deal of time. Consequently we had to , work far into the night, and ghastly, ghostly work it was. We had a little room about 10 x 12, situated on the second floor and facing the street. At one end of the room was a door · opening into the main dissecting room and se- cured by a bolt on the inside. As the door shut tight in the jamb the ·bolt was seldom used except when we wished to keep the students from in- truding. At the· other end of the rootn was a door opening into the museum. In order to t~each our rootn it was necessary to pass through the museum, and at night it was ·no easy tnatter for one to find his way through the long, narrow, crooked passage which separated the specimen cases. The main dissecting room was a long, narrow, semi-circular room and was the space direCtly beneath the atnpitheatre or pit where the lec- tures were delivered. The building was on a corner, and consequently faced two streets. At one end of the room was an immense old-fash- ioned wood stove, the pipe of which extended the whole lengt~ of the room and was fastened to the ceiling with wires at intervals of eight or ten feet. My reason for thus describing the room will be seen later on. And now for the · story. One cold storrny night in midwinter tny chutn and I were engaged in our usual wor,k. It was late Sunday night ; in faCt about 1nidnight. We were obliged to finish our work for the next day that night, and we still had several hours to ·work. Just then Steve stopped work, and look- ing up, said : ''Jack, I've got to 1nake a visit -a sick call-and I guess I'll attend to it now. I won't be gone over three-quarters of an hour. You won't be aftaid to stay here, will you?\ Although the latter part of his remarks were ad- dressed to .me in a laughing way, still they net- tled Ine, and 1 ans\\\rered boldly that I was not afraid and that he '1night stay as long as he wished. After he had gone I began to feel a little like Bob Acres; tny courage began to ooze out o( the ends of 1:ny fingers. I had never been left alone at night before, .and although I had had considerable experience and was not inclined to be timid, it occurred to me just then, vvith a chilling effeCt, that there were pleasanter places to spend a winter's evening than the disseCting room of a medical college. It is no wonder that I arrived at this conclusion so quickly, for right ... on the table in front of tne was the body of a _man -the si1bjed on which we \\-Tere working. On 'a board placed across the stove and supported by wooden hot·ses was stretched the body of a negro woman, frozen stiff. The janitor had placed . her in this protninent position \to thaw her out.\ On the floaT in front of, the stove was another body in a· similar condition, and placed there for the same purpose. With this description of my little I ox I 2 room my readers will see that while I had plenty of company it wasn't exactly what you would call lively there. Well, after a few morrrents of refleCtion I shook off my: uneasiness and settled down to work. I was at V\-~ork on the axillary artery in the ann-pit, and as there is an ab!;lndance of muscles in this locality it- requires much care arid attention. The work had a great fascination for tne, and growing more and rnore interested in my work was soon oblivious of my surroundings.

'THE CONCORDIENSIS. 5 I had been at work perhaps half an hour when as I was. in a long calico gown which reached I thought I heard a groan outside in the disseCting from my neck to my heels, skull cap on, a dis- room. I stopped work suddenly, and in an un- seB:ing knife in my hand and a look highly in- easy state of mind listened to see if it would be dicative of terror on my face, there is little won- repeated.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. As I said before, the stovepipe was wired to the ceiling. The windows were pulled down ti·on1 the top, and the wind blowing tnaiuly fron1 the north would veer around once in a while and blow through the open windows across these wires, producing the n1ysterious sound that had so frightened n1e.

The Castle Old. ([ :J'ANDING lone in grandeur's mould, A9 A monument to men of old, A ruined castle, on yonder rock, Boldly fronts the storm king's shock. Trailing ivy o'er its walls, While the suQlight on it falls, Tendrils fondly clinging there, Scenting all the summer's air. Joyous birds, with plumage fair, In the balmy morning air, Rest themselves and gaily sing, Ere they wander on the wing. Leaflets browned by autumn sigh, All about the ruin lie- Scattered at its feet around, On the chill and frozen ground. Round about each nook and cranny, Flitting bats, in hundreds many, Build their nests in places where Man was wont his ho1ne to share. ----------·--·---- ------ ·--- --------·· --- And the ow let flaps his wings, Through the vale the echo rings Of his hootings, far and near, In the moonliight soft and dear. Through those ruins, cold and grim, Creeps, with S;tealth, a reptile sHrn; · Hissing, whiilst each lesser dweller ··Seeks by flight its life to shelter. Snows of win.tet falling fast, Blown by inany a chilling blast, Through each crack and crevice pa~s, Softly sink t0 rest at last. When the spri~g-time comes again, When the gentle April rain Falls upon the sleepjng earth~ And the flowers anew have birth; Then come lo'\'ers sighing sadly., Bright-eyed 1naidens singing gladly, Winsome chHdren tripping shyly' Round about its walls so slyly. Seasons come and seasons go, Summer, Autumn,.., Winter flow., Bringing to some hearts a spring Where loved birds no longer sing. And those walls so still and old Many a story could unfold, II Crumbling now with times decay For painters' brush and poets' lay. COMMUNICATION. Gymnasium Work. The sentitnent in colleges gener·ally is in favor of gymnastic exercises sufficient to tnake and keep the body healthy. Especially is this so at Union. If you ask a professor or a student what he thinks of gyn1nastic exercise, he praises it. The equiptnent necessary to plenty of exercise is a rootn, and a body equal to exertion. The novice is surprised to find how quickly he be- cotnes tired in going through si In ple calisthenic exercises, which require no tools, or at most a pair of wooden dumb-bells. In such a gytn- nasiutn a persevering 1nan can obtain sufficient exercise. Few students, howeve1·, will do this for tnany weeks. It is not pleasure, it is work.
