Y. He was grad- uated from the State Normal School there at the age of 19 and entered Columbia College of Co- lumbia University with the class of 11:\11. During this period he be- gan his career as educator by teaching as principal of the Union district scho.ol at Sherman Park, now Thornwood, in Westchester County. Upon applying for this position, h<:o was told that some of the older pupils had \discouraged\ a pro- cession of previous teachers through their \roughness.\ A member of the school board ca.u- tioned young Mr. Fox that he stood a good chance of being thrown bodily out of school the first day he tried to teach. His reply was: \If anybody gets thrown out, it won't be I.\ The 19-year-old teacher's determined jaw and ath- letic frame apparently stood him. in good stead, for he accepted the job, and nobody was thrown out. Doctor's Dl.'gree in 1917 He received his Master of Arts degree from Columbia in 1912 and the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1917. During his college career, he be- came prominent in literary and forensic activities at Columbia as president of the Philolexian So- ciety and editor of the \Columbia University Monthly,\ a literary magazine. He won the Lincoln Medal, the Chandler historical prize, the Curtis oratorical gold medal, the Philolexian prizes for public speaking and for essays, and the McClymonds scholarship. He joined Alpha Chi Rho fraternity. <Later, he served seven years as national councillor of Alpha Chi Rho, and was its president in 1927 and 1928.) He was elected to membership' in Phi Beta Kappa, national hon- m·ary scholastic fr!lternity, while at Columbia. Starting as an assistant in 1911, he became a lecturer at Columbia and later, as a member of the his- tory department, rose in rank to a fuii professorship in 1927, serv- ing for a time as chairman of the department. In 1929 and 1930 he was visiting professor at Yale Uni- versity. In 1927 and 1928, Dr. Fox was director of the American Uni- versity Union in London and, as Carnegie visiting professor, he de- livered lectures upon the history of American society in nearly all the universities and colleges in the British Isles, as well as the annual address before the Royal Scottish Society of Arts. For a time, he served as editor .of the \Columbia University Quar- terly.\ Amerlcan History Specialist Dr. Fox specialized in American social history, particularly of the early ner!ods. From 1918 to 1920 he had been a research associate of the Carnegie lnstitute, working to prepare for publication Prof. T. L. Osgood's four volumes, \American Colonies in the 18th Century.\ His contributions to historical scholarship came about chiefly in papers read before learned societies at colleges and universi~ies in many of the United States, and in addresses rather than in books. But, as co-editor with Prof. Arthur M. Schlesinger DR. DIXON RYAN of Harvard University of the 12- volume series entitled \A History of American Life,\ he achieved wide recognition, for the series was termed the most significant under- taking in American history in the past two decades. Dr. Fox, with Prof. John Allen Krout of Colum- bia, authored Vol. 5 of the series. \The Completion of Independ- ence: 1790-1830.\ Published Wor]{s Numbered among his other pub- lished works are: Aristocracy in the Politics of New York\ (1919), \An Outline of Early American History\ <1922), \Herbert L. Os- good, An American Schola'r\' (1923), \Caleb Heathcote, Gentle- man Colonist\ (1926), and as joint-author, \Aspects of Social History\ (1931) besides about 50 articles. He edited the \Westchester Court Minister, 1657-1696\ (1924) together with other publications of the Westchester County His- torical Society, J. Fenimore Coop- er's \New York\ <1930), \A Quar- ter Century of Learning\ <1931); \Ideas in Motion\ in 1935; \Yan- kees and Yorkers\ in 1940. He was editor for, am.ong others, \Cavalcade of America\ <DuPont radio program) from 1935 to 1938: eight volumes of the New York State Histol'ical .Association series; six volumes of Croft's American History series; and 10 volumes of the \History of the State of New York.\ In addition, he had been contributing editor of \New York History,\ qtLarterly magazine of the New Yor-k State Historical As- sociation since 1919; and wrote the forward for numerous other books. He was eTect:ed president of Union College Feb. 21, 1934, and a::<sumed his duties July 1 that year. Three months later, on Oct. 12, he was inaugurated as presi- dent of the coil ege and as chan- cellor of Union Uaiversity, which includes the gradt;~te departments represented by Albany Medical College, All>any Law School, Al- bany Colleg€ of Pharmacy and Dudley Observatory. His accmnpllsbments in the de- cade of associatiun with Union were manifold, He inaugurated the Mohawk Drama Festival, with Charles Coburn and his wife, the late Ivan Wills Coburn, to make Union the first American college to carry uu t a cuoperative enter- prise with the pt·ofessional stage. He inaugurated a system of gov- ernment vvork apprenticeships which gave selected students the opportunity to .co.ordinate their studies with practical experience in federal, state and civic jobs. ·city and Campus Mourn Untimely Death of Leader Outstanding Educator Was Great Humanitarian; Noted Liberal, and Civil Servant The death of Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, 12th President of Union Col- lege, and a leader in American Educa.tion, on TuE.>sday night has shocked the college communit'' and leaders in education all over the world. Dr. Fox was stricken in a build- ing of the General Electl'ic Com- pany while arranging for a sched- ule of specially planned courses to be given at Union during the next summer session. Rushed to Ellis Hospital, Dr. Fox subsided at 5:55, a little over an hour after he was stricken. Before he died, however, Mrs. Fox had reached his bedside. State Ftmerat This afternoon at 4 o'clock a state funeral was held in the Memorial Chapel. Representatives were pres- ent from all walks of J.ife to pay tribute to Union's bf'Joved presi- dent. After a complete cessation of all college exercises, the doors of the Memorial Chapel were opened to the college community at 3:00. The general public was admitted at 3:30. The large group of civilian stu- dents present were seated in the center section in the rear of the balcony. The V-12 Unit entered the Chapel en masse and were seated in the remainder of the seats in the balcony. The Trustees of the Col- lege, appointed honorary pall bear- ers, and their families, were es- corted to the first three rows in the center section of the auditorium, after an assemblage in Hale House at 3:45. Seats in the center section were reserved for members of the faculty of Union College, of Union University, the Commissioned of- ficers of the V-12 Unit, the staff of the college, and members of their families, together with members of delegations of alumni and civic organizations, until 3:45.

Atwood, minister of the First Re- formed Church in Schenectady, FOX~1887-1945 and H. Victor Frelick, minister of the State Street Presbyterian Church. The Union College Choir, under the leadership of Dr. Elmer Tidmarsh, sang \The Lord's Prayer\ and the \Battle Hymn of the Re- public.\ He improved the C{)llege plant, taised the level of faculty salaries and made the college a cultural center for the community.

Fot· CONCORDY'S FRI'END A great man always receives h.is greatest honors after he has gone. This IS evident from. the scores of tributes paid to D1·. Fox in the few days since his death. To these we would humbly add our own. We have been proud and honored by the knowledge that the .Concdrdiensis was dem· to the heart of our late Prexy. We have known that for many months, and we have unsuccessfully striven to achieve the heights of quality that he would have had us !'each.

He was, to the individuals of the Board, a genuine friend and a great inspiration.

The president gets blamed for a few things that really shouldn't be laid at his door; but he gets credit for very, very many things ac- c.omplished by other people.

This special session is in addition to the regular full summer term that will run from the first week in July to the end of October. The special summer session will be attended by forty Fellows, all men who are experienced teachers of science in high schools. They are to be chosen ft•om among candi- dates presented by the school su- perintendents in 140 cities of over 25,000 population throughout the Middle Atiantic States and New England, each superintendent to file onP nomination. Each fellow- ship will cover the cost of tuition, I maintenance and travel expense. The Fellow must be under forty years of age, and hold at least a bachelor's degree which represents substantial undergraduate courses in mathematics and physics. Two courses will be given in the Physics Building on the campus by Professors Peter I. Wold, Vla- dimir Rojansky and Everett W. Thatcher--one in Electronics (Va- cuum Tubes-Theory and Pheno- menal. and one in Modern Physical Theory and Phenomena. General Electric scientists and eng.ineers will give some of the lectures in these two courses in supplement to those by the Union College pro- fessors. The most novel departure is in the course on Modern Application of Physical Measurements. These thirty-two lectures and conferences, with problem assignments, will be given at the General Electric Com- pany's research and engineering labratories, largely by General Electl'ic personnel but under the academic Wold. cha1·ge of Professor It is probable that many of the science teachers in attendance will want to apply their sum- mer's experience toward the resi- dence requirements of post-grad- uate work in Union College or in some university. The College has estimated the residence value of the session as a quarter -of a year, or eight semester hours, which may be used toward the master's or the doctor's degree. The program has been designed, not immediately to influence peda- gogical methods, but to enlarge each Fellow's grasp of t•ecent de- velopments in physical science. \There is no doubt,\ say those in charge, \as to the ultimate bene- fits to the schools. When the Fel- low returns to his classroom at the end of the summer, freshly aware of the directions which the scientific adventure into the un- known is now taking, he will un- doubtedly enrich his teaching with new understanding and inspire scientific ambition in the minds of his students.\ Saturday, FPb. 3 BaskPtball: Union vs. Wesleyan Univ. at Middletown.

It is but a small sense of comfort to know that he laid down his labors while actively engaged in the work of the College which he loved so much.

During his ten years at Union he has thoroughly established himself as one of the great college presidents of the country. He possessed the imagination and energy essential to leaderehip. He was not swayed by all the various shibboleths that have developed in educational fields in recent years. He was sound and practical in his administration-an outstanding scholar in the field of history; sympathetic with the undergraduates; and fair in faculty relation5hips. The city of Schenectady will miss him as one of its outstanding citizens. -LeRoy J. Weed, SecretaJ·y, Board of Trustees of Union ,College No greater shock could have been sustained by the College in these difficult times than the Joss of President Fox. During the more than five years that I have been intimately a:;-eociated with him in the adminis- tration of the College, I have marvelled at his kindly consideration of others, at the depth of his wisdom and the breadth of his knowledge, at his poise and self-control in the face of perplexing p1·oblems, and, above all, at his unGparing devotion and tireless exertion in the work of the College. There is no one of us who does not feel the strongest urge to contribute everything we can to the cause for which he gave so much-the building of an even greater Union. -Benjamin P.

The old college with its traditions and its many distinguished men, the im- portant part it has played and is continuing to play, the beauty and age of its grounds and buildings in the midst old Schenectady, all this ap- pealed to him and he evid<ently liked to feel himGelf a part in ito; history. The other trait-a personal one-was his frank cordiality toward those who disagreed with him. He had clear, positive ideas upon many subjects, but when some principle was involved he was without insist- ence. He met opposition with a smile and with a perfect willingnes.;; to give in.

March, Professor EmPritus of Psychology President Fox always took a fri-endly interest in student activities. He was almost always pre•3ent at athletic contests, dances, concerts, Mountebanks performances or any other student event. He was par- ticularly interested in student publications and always read them from cover to cover. A remarkable thing was the total absence of any attempt on hi·3 part to control or censor the activities. Through his interest and encourage- ment, and etpecially through his own example of good taste. he PXerted an important influence on the quality and tone of all student affairs. It is notable that one of his !aGt official activities was in connection with the Conference on Student Affairs which was held on the campus on January 26 and 27. He participated actively in the conference and it was quite evident that he was vitally interested in the po£>t-war development of the student affairs. Undergraduate life is, and will continue to be, enriched as a reGult of his administration and all those who have been connected with stu- dent life will feel n deep personal loss as a result of his death. -William W. Bennett, Professor of Economics, Coordinator of Student ActivitiPS. When he came to Union in 1934, I was greatly impreS~sed by the courage and directnes» with which he attacked the preoJsing problems of the College, Then, Imposing upon himself a Spartan work schedule, he went on to develop his plan for its growth. Dr. Fox treated his callers with courtesy and restraint even under the most trying circumstances. A keen memory for facts and figures was of great assistance to the President in his budget conferences. He was, I believe, particularly interested in projects for improving student Jiving conditions and followed the construction of Hale House and the remodeling of the North Section of South College quite closely. The several projects which Dr. Fox carried out for improving the facilities of the library gave him a great deal of pleasure. His active mind was always planning for the College and he held its interests deeply at heart. The lo.-s of a leader with his foresight and imagination is indeed a great blow. -Anthony Hoadley, Proff'ssor of Civil EnginPPring, Former Comptroller.

On January 30th, 1945 that star disappeared and I'm floating again in space. -KingslPy W. Given, Director of Announcements In the acadE'miG worl<l Dr. Fox was. I think, a perfectionist, always striving to bring Union's contribution to its fullest measure. He would not s.pare himself. Hac! he been inclined to regard his duties more casually, had his interests been more restricted, had he considered his responsibilities to be less urgent, he might have partially escaped the heavy onus of his poGition, but he would not have been Dr. Fox. He fulfilled his role, and we the faculty will now realize more invisively than ever the quality of his leadership. He was always ready to listen to the problems of others and his suggeetions were invariably helpful because he had skill in analyzing difficulties. At the top of the stairway in the Administration building his office door was always open, and there one would find him at work, never so abGorbed that he would not be instantly and generously attentice to one's own troubles. His career gave true meaning to the phrase \a gentleman and a scholar,\ and, more than that, he was a true friend. -Harold W. Blodgett, Field of English The Faculty of the Albany Medical College was shocked to hear of the sudden death of Chancellor Fox. To us in Albany, Dr. Fox was peculiarly clc•:se. He came frequently to the Medical College, attended and presided at Faculty meetings, and endeared himself to all because of his devoted interest in medical education and medical affairs. No problem was too difficult and no administrative matter too remote. Wise, scrupu- lously fair, judicious, and kind, he wa\3 an ideal administrator.

But pleaee be sure that all of us at Yale and university people all over the country are sharing in your sorrow.

Friday night Wi!J.iam G. Avkett, Education EdHor of the New York Herald Tribune, delivered the key- note address opening the confer- ence. He discussed athletics, aca- demic guidance and ct·edit ior stu- d~nt activities, control of fratern- itie:;, and postwar masculine stu- dent life in the libeml American colleges. Mr. Avirett predicted that a better college will emerge from the pre»ent ferment and travail. He is certain that a healthy evolution and not an academic revolution is forthcoming. He believes that uni- versal compulsory peacetime mili- tary training will be offset by the growing tendency to complete high scho.ol a year earlier than in the past. He believes that veterans will be special cases generously and wisely handled but that by 1950 they will form a disappeal\ing ele- ment in campus population. Mr. Avirett called for a new unity be- tween the campus and the class- t·oom. He believes the time is at hand fol' educators to stop thinking about cun icula as separate from other phases of student life . Among the pt·oblems discussed at Saturday's ses~ions were fra- ternity-college relationships, stan- dat·dization of fraternity costs, financing student activities, grant- ing of college credit for participa- tion in extracurricular activities, athletics activities as an educa- tional process, without reference to alumni enthusiasm, inter-collegiate prestige, or income from public ex- hibitions.

LAST ISSUE OF TERM Vol. LXIX. No. 14 i Whitaker TO ALL: SMOOTH SAILING The Student Newspaper a:nd Wa,rti1me l.og of Union College SCHENECTADY, N.Y., FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1945 Price 10c Trustees At a meeting of the Delphic ciety on Monday, February 5, following men were elected membership: So- the to \This spirit of amiability led Dr. Fox to take a warm personal in- terest in the students. He knew an extraordinary number of them by name and the students readily un- derstood that in the president they had a friend and counsellor who could always be relied upon to see their difficulties and sympathize with them. \Dr. Fox's life was one of hard study, intense application, and a prodigal expenditure of energy. He viewed his task with seriousness and labored incessantly at the multitude of duties that beset the busy man of .affairs. The demands on his time were many, but he answered them fully and freely without hesitation. His constant amiability and cheerfulness under the great pressure of his office might well serve ae an example to others. \The faculty of Union College have experienced a deep sorrow at the pas::;ing of Dr. Fox. This statement has tnerefore been pre- pared to give expression to their appredation of his services at 'union College, and to their sense of the heavy loss that they have sustained. \For the faculty \Harold W. Bibber \D.a vld S. Morse \Benjamin !3. Whltalter \Harrison C.

At this same meeting election of officers was held. The new officers are William Baker, President, and Frank Greenwoo!'l, Secretary. The society's plans for i;he next term include all its previous func- tions such as ushering and helping with Freshman Orientation as well as some additional ones to be an- nounced at .a future date. Robert Potter, the president in- cumbent, also told of the society having elected Professor Bennett as advisor, and that he had accept- ed the position. ----0•---- Rev. David E.

Next wee\( many Union men will bid their ahna 1nater fa1·ewel1. We of the Concord~· wish them a full and happy life. We have made many mistakes, and we havt' been accused of many things where we have been innocent. V.f e have tried-we have tried very hard. PAY YOUR DEBT This term we have seen the passing oi our lJeloved President, and the appointment of an acting P1·esident. \Ve have seen stu- dent actiYities continue undet· the most stl'ained conditions that have ever existed at Union. We have seen the \'-12 unit cut to a small fntction of its former number. ThesP and many other experiences we have en- countered, and now the term draws to a close. We must say goodby. Next week Union will house many empty buildings as Union men empty their minds and take the first train home. Those homed are widespread a11d for this reaso11 this etli- turial appears. Not for this reason alorw however-fol' you owe a debt. Cnfortunatel.v, more than half of the staff of the Conco1·diensis is leaving. Yout· editors will miss them for they have done a \von- derful job. \\'ithout them, the student IJod~· would have had no organ of self-expression. \Nithout them the Concordiensis could not have existed. By this, we do not mean to infer that the Concord~- has been the paper that we wanted it to be. EveQ· staff, ever,\· yem· has allusions of grandeur, and we can- not say that we have achieved our ultimate goal. We have tried, however, and the men have worked together, thus easing the strain from the backs of the few guiding indi- viduals. Union has been your home :·or many months, and we hope that it can contimH:' as such for many more. Regardless of whether or not this is the case, we trust that ~·ou have found Union a pleasant and hospitable home. H you have, you have com•.: to realize that Union would be the ideal col- lege to sugg-est to your high school or vet- eran friends. It has l'ecently been computed that the college contributes from $1,000 to $1,400 to every student who spends his four colleg-e years within these walls. The yearly tuition of $-!00 does not nearly cover the college cust. Through the abundant endowment fund, provided by gracious alumni and friends, Union men have the advantage of low college costs. The strength of a college lies in the strength of the student body, and th•~ strength of the student body lies in the strength of the students themselves, and the alumni. You can help. By suggesting to logi- cal candidates for admission to Bill Ketz, Uirecto1· of Admissions, you can repa;r, at le~t!'t pnrtiallr, the debt that ~;ou owe.

AR~ AHEAD HEAVY HEADWORK T HE B-29 has an \electric brain\. And it's pretty comforting and assuring for a gunner to toss some of the heavy headwork over to it when a Jap Zero is pumping shells at him and flying as fast as he is, or faster. The .. brain\ or computer, is con- tinuously solving an equation and making a continuous adjustment of his gun's aim. There are many elements in that equation-temper- ature, plane speed, windage, for ex- ample. And his bullet is :fired, not at the eneQJy plane, but at where it's go- ing to he a fraction of a second later. The computer supplements and cor· rects human judgment in the factors conditioning that aim, takes over that part of the gunner's responsibility. The \brain\ has electronic tubes- plus other electrical and mechanical elements-to help with its important thinking. The corrections are relayed to the guns continuously and auto- matically. And the gunner is free to concentrate on the business of keep- ing the J ap plane framed in his sights. General ElectricCo,, Schenectady 5, N.Y.
