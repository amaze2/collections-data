Prof. Bray's Lecture ~ r, ' 1 ( 1 (Continued from page 1) :tinued substitution: of , \wise-crack- ing\ for basic reasaning. He hoped :that scientists would cast aside tl:'le desire far popularity, llilld begin to think af how to place the theory o! evolution on a scientific basis, and come to consider \whether we have moved toward the solution of the central problem of' biology\-the finding out of the \real significance . of \life.\ Biologists have been misguided in their efforts, Professor Bray held, by building th.eir foundations on the axiems of pll.ysical science. ·Too much dependence has been placed on pure mathematics. Matll- ematics works on assumptions, and makes deductions based on these assumptions, while philosophy is today \simply one branch of hl!· man enterprise that makes ·asser- tions of the actual world in which we live.\ Referring to Halda:ne, Wallace, Lillie, Sherrington, and Starling as .\insurgents i:n the .study of Professor Bray, nevertheless, ··~·-ft·-'~\ 1 . that caution be USed in the eX](>U~naL•] tion of life. Not a()cepting either the mechanistic of\ the vitalistic views of life, Professor Bray ex:- pressed the hope that the time come when chemists, physicists, and biologists will ·come tO\\'·t.h., ..... to discuss \first principles,\ and then there will be c•a new science' with a different basis.\ When he· casts mechanism aside, one wonders whether Professor Bray is merely afraid that a me- chanistic conception of ·human be- ·havior wou'ld impair the high plane <>n which we have !)laced the ideas about the human spirit. Careful, consideration leads one te think that such a conception, although 1 it will not explain \the infinite o11:t' of life,\ will make one appreciate more fully those phenomena which constitute the inanimate. But one must agree with Professor Bray that by showing the relations, life to the universe as a whole, a deeper sense of the \uncontrollable substance,\ the spirit of life, is ob- tained. Prof. Bray closed his lecture with an attempt at defining life. And admitting the inadequacy of his definition, stated in part, that is \a unity of relations existing be- tween functional activities of .organism and its structural parts, and between the organism as a, whole and its environment,\ aU so coordinated as to maintain the un- ity of the organism. Rad·io Club May Have -Transmitting A meeting of the Union Radio club was held on WedJilesJda,y 1 night in Silliman hall for the pur- pose of reorganizing and discussing plans for the future. After consid- erable discussion it was decided not to elect permanent officers or prepare a constitution until later as the club is still growing. Geor&e Tracy, '34, was elected as tempor- ary chairman, and W. B. Plummer, '86, is temporary secretary. The goal of the club for the next few months is the setting up of an amateur radio station in the Elec- trical Engineering building. F<ot' the present, a portaole transmitter belanging to one of i:he students is to be used, so it is IJoped that tlle <:lub can have a small amateur code, 2tation on the air within a week. Dr. Thatcher of the Physics De-, :Partment is the faculty sponsor of the club. He has had extensiv:e ex- Perience both as an amateur oper- ator and as director of a club in :Previous years. Dean Berg is also ~o-operating with the club,. provid- lng the space for the station.

McGee BEER The ·defeat of th1! vote for repeal in th.e House of Representatives yesterday obl:i.viates the Dem- ocratic pre-election promise of \Beer For Christ- mas.\ Th.e vote of 271 to 144 was however, only ~ix . votes short of the necessary two-thirds for passage. The vote was decidedly wet, and the passage of the bill is practically assured in the next session of the House. We, as college men, should weigh this question thoroughly in our minds and attempt to arrive at some conclusion as to its benefit or harm, if beer were to ·become a legal beverage. There is no question but that beer is being sold at the present time, in spite of laws to the contrary. There are innumerable places in this city, as in every other city, where beer may be purchased. What would happen if beer were to become le- ~alized? Would any catastrophe descend upon us, causing the ruination of the nation and all of its inhabitants? There are many people who share this belief, and many others sincerely be- lieve that the country would be relieved of the present economic strain which threatens · the breakup of the country, as a result of the increas- ed revenue. The revenue from beer, if it were made a legal product, would bring huge sums of money into our national treasury. Various people have said that many men are unable to buy food, let alone beer. The fact remains, nevertheless, that im- mense quantities of beer and other intoxicating beverages are being bought by the American peo- ple. Instead of the federal government's receiving revenue from this sale; .bootleggers are reaping huge profits. If beer were legalized the federal treasury would receive this money which is now going to rack- eteers. A better quality of beer would be assured by government supervision and the millions now spent for the enforcement of the eighteenth amendment could be spent for emergency relief. THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO Editor's Note: This is the second and concluding part of the editol\ial which appeared in Friday's issue. The marking system used at Chicago is quite unlike that used in most colleges. Instead .of the numerical system,, a three letter plan is used.

I was merely trying to help him out i for, although he means weU and tries hard, living : i in the \Barracks\ is beghmin:g to ten on him. :lit is pathetic how a couple years of careless asso- i ciations will influence the· character of a man. The i Betas. offered Ricky in exchange for him but hi's brother11 had taken a Hiking to the kid and ref\used- , to let him go although they •knew that H would be for his own :good as we'll as theirs. Ricky '. surely .is a fine .dog, i:f yoti· are .in ·douht ask .... --~ .. ---~ \Bunny\' Ryon. , :Many of u·s who were fortunate enough to at- i: tend the Mountebanks perfol'Illance last 'Satur- day night returned home with the feeling that for once we had spent a really enjoyable even- , . in•g, as 'weU as a very profitruble one. For once :! we could look forward to having breakfast in the :: morning rather than combining it with Sunday dinner, and for once we would not feel conn>ell'- ed to put on the usual dark brown suit, which in itself is a great relief. It is a strange thing that it should take over three years to bring some .of us to the re~lization that there are other func- :tions besides athletic and social affairs· that_ are well werth our time and for which we should show more appreciatien. Our first two years· are spent in becoming acquainted with the college i; and our fellow students, eur next year is spent in , , rest·ing ·on our laurels after having accomplished ' 1 the above task, and then finally in our last year . , we realize how much we have missed and how ' much better we could do if we had it all to live over again. It is a very ·cruel' world and well do we know that \many wiU be ·called but few will be chosen!\ In the last few days we have noticed' that many ef the more prominent men of the campus are . ; sporting new blazers. As yet we have not .been ' able to get close enough to these fortunate yeung i men to see if the blazers are a;ppropriately in- scribed but we trust that this detail has been satisfactorily taken care of. In our ignorance i we wonder if, together witlJ. many other recent innovations and improvements, the college has decided to organize a fire. brigade in erder to af- ford us fire as well as .police protection. If this is the case the more timid souls may new rest assured that no harm can possibly befall them and that all wiU be taken care of by Tom and his force, ably assisted by Mitch and his fellow firemen. . In our desire to C()operate we might sqggest that fire hats could be secured from Ed Wynn and possibly \Sleepy\ Gillette could be in- duced to convert his new plaything into a w.ell equipped fire truck. And now we are forced to turn to the inevita;ble personal touches. Professor Waldron's pride and joy,. William, recently complained to me concern- ing the omission of his name from the ranks of the prominent alumni of Tafes 'School for Back- wa~d Bo~s. Not wishing to. hurt anyone's feelings I 1mmed1ately conducted an investigatien and found that, although his marks were not such to advance him into the ·Summer School Division led by his friend James, he gained distinction i~ his own field. Even now the Masters use his name to scare the younger boys and force them to study, We ar.e informed th.at by this method the average ef the school has been raised a num- ber of points, and that. in. the near future a bust is to be unveiled bearing the: ·very appropriate inscription: \In Memory of Our Will-May His Tribe Increase.\ We congratulate Bill on hi>! singular success. We feel that we have done enough for one dav so we will close and turn to the cultivation of ou;. intellects. M.G. isfactory work and the student must repeat or drop the course.

The normal program for a full-time stu(lent in the college is four courses each quarter.

No known method of joining sections of vitrified clay . conduit effected a seepage-tight joint. With scientific thoroughness, telephone men made many tests under service conditions. They devised a bandage of cheese-doth, waterproof pa.per and mortar. Easily made and applied, this mcn·tar bandage is tight against silt and sand.

Featherstonhaugh ON IMPROVING OUR DANCES Once again the subject of fraternity dances, a.nd the way in which, they are conducted, b~ a.l'lsen. Every year something is said about the management of social activities on the c~pus, • ·but very little is actually done to improve the conditions. In the past three year:;;, with the ex- ception of one, or possibly two instances, no disci- plinary measures have been taken to improve the con:duct at social functions. Until last year, the administration had full charge of aH such disciplinary measures. The Student Council, upon its inauguration, appointf)d a Dance Committee to handle such matters. The committee proceeded to draw up a set of regula- tions governing social functions, sent ~opies to the fMtern'ity houses, and published tlle:!ll ·in Tile Concordiensis. What was the result of all this? · · The Sti:J.dent body paid little or na attention to m.ost of the rules,. the Council forgot al:><mt them, aad the dances have ·cGntinued to be condl.Jcted in much the same manner as in former years. Now the Dance Committee is going to make another effort. The rules are to be amended,. and strict o-bservance of the law will be required. Per- haps so, but it does not seem to us that the Coun- cil.should resort to \strong arm\ methods to ac .. c<>mpUsh its purpofle. \' The main problem that confronts the Dance ' Committee is the drinking done by students at dance.(3. It is all right for the Council to. insist :;. that tbere be no drinking, and th.reaten severe· • penalties for those who break the rules; but such procedure will never stamp the evil out. There always has and always will be drinking at dances, and no set of regulations is going to stop it. It ca:n be cut down to a minimum, however, and• thus - cease to be an evil, or even a problem. The only way to solve the problem is for the Council to secure the whole-hearted cooperation of t]le fraternities. Should a person a-ttend while under the influence of liquor, he should be asked to leave by one of the members of the house giv- ing the dance. It should be the responsibility of the fraternity to keep out those who are unable to conduct themselves in a gentlemanly fashion. The Cbuncil should deal with this matter through the fraternity:, not through the individual. If' disorderly persons were not permitted to enter a dance, the trouble would be eliminated befor.e it began, provided that the members of the frater- nity giving the dance did their part toward keep- ing the affaii· well regulated. By placing the responsibility on the fraternity, ancd ·not the 'individl.Jal, the kind of social' func- tions desired by the administration and the Coun- c'n wiil probably result. Very often a man may be willing to disgrace himself, but will think many times before bringing unfavorable publiGity upon hie f1•aternity. IF! A great deal of the unpopularity of the pre~ ent rule!'! is caused by the unreasonable restriction· .. ot invitation\ for semi-closec dances, The thirty invitations al~owed a h,ouse are worse than l).Qne at all 'because it results in. some friends ot mem- bers of the fraternity not Being invited, therefore considering this neglect unreasonable. This prob- lem~ however, has already been partially solved THE ·CONCORDIENSfS, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1932 Just to be different we~:re not even going to try to pick an .All\American tootball team this· f~l. La.st :year we found tbat so ~any sJ>orts write:r;s and football authorities disagreed with our selec-- tions that we have come to the conclusien that anyone'S guess is as good ·as the· next mythical eleven. At ·least .if fifty thousand Frenchmen can't be wrong, a like number of football author- ities not only can be but are wrong when it is a qpesf:i()n of picking an .All-American team. We humbly offer the suggestion that intercollegiate· football follow the example 'Of professional base- ball or the cinema iudustry ln appointing a czar such as Judge. Landis or Wm Hays. Such a :grid- iron mogUl would be the logical person to name· an authoritative AJl•Ameriean eleven. Or better still let's' give up the futile custom of choosing a m·ythical superior team. Far •be it f\rom our intentions to defile th.e edd- torial page ef the Concordy with sparts comment, but our ad·viee is to watch Notre Dame's ha1fback, ~ay l;3rancbeau, in tomouow's game against Southern CaUiiornia. He is reported by the Asso- ciated Press to be suffering from a severe attack; o:f induenza, the same malady that laid low Hunk Anderson's Ramblers the week that Army suc- cumbed to a team that arose fram sick beds to score touchdowns at will. 1:;1)· ·fact we pick Notre Dame to overwhelm their opponents fJ;\oin U.

We noticed in tJt,e. coll!lm:Ncs' of aur fav<!.l.'ite evening newspap'er that none other than our own Greg Lippitt will see action with the Cooperstown quintet tomorrow evening :against the· G. ~. A. A. basketball team. Our sympathies should rest witll. the home town :five, hut consideri·ng that Greg is .playing and remembering several occa- sions w))en a couple of test men spoiled the eve- ning for us, we find ourselves heartily supporting Cooper,!Jtown. The word has gone round the campus that with the end of the football season the band has la~d away in mothballs \Under the Double Eagle'\ and actually has mastered a new piece. Of course we refuse to lend our suppa-rt to this radical en- terprise. As part of the traditions of the dear old Garnet, we insist upon the retention of \Under the Double Eagle.\ It is. true· that once during our sophomore year the Male Musicians burst forth with some strains of Victor Herbert, but the old march was not neglected. Let us advance a few suggestions that might very well be incorporated into Prexy's Eight-Year- Plan: 1. Our graduation. Much as we love the dear old walls of Union, we hope to be numbered among her alumni by 1940. 2. A football team as .successful as the eleven we had this fall, so our friends. won't have to say \0 .

A!sk us· to pay too high a price when they ask us · · : to suBstitute this for football in: our colleges. Such i · exchang,e would on:Jy break up our undergraduates into wa:rring factions without having given them a chance to be united about anything. Football is our means of keeping our undergraduates united.\. Are the students of American colleges seek- • JJ;!g higlr~r edueli.tion or are they in college t()· play • · t\ot>tball? It is true that football unites its play- ers, but dCleS it Unite the undergraduate body SO qrat in later life they will be qualified to unite in consideration of worldly affairs? In. Earopean universities the undergraduates , ai:e students of government. They· are preparing tlle:~nselve::s fo1· service to their country. It is only natural that factions with different opinions arise as there Is always more than one view on all sub- jects, especially in the affairs of goveL'nment. Does t:he football of our American colleges of- fer a ·student a chance to ekpress any ,opinions of his own? Do football teams settle national .politicar problems? The only way football keeps unity among the undergraduates of American col- leges is by drawing a large audience to sit to- gether in the grandstands and in a unit cheer for one team. Warring factions still arise, but the difference cf ideas rests with that team which one prefers to see score the most touchdowns. Factions with different opinions should be en- couraged in American colleges. Students should \' 'have· , ide!Uf ebncernirig th:eir governm~nt, and sli'0Uld dl:ltiite' t'o e\'If£~r 'pl'>litics When they graduate. fi· 'J.l'lle 'Cou'btio/ d'ep'erid'S: on \Ci>Tieg'Ef men. to take the places of its offJ~:tlS' wh:en•'tlie· latter pass away .. Problems of the country shoul<l be uppermost to the undergraduate. They are the ones who someday may desire successors themselves. They should be qualified to take over the affairs of the nation. W'e want unity, but unity is a theoretical cer- tainty that will never be accomplished in affairs of State. Training men to aet as a unit in foot- ·ball means that these men will' only be followers when they ar.e able to v.ote, There must be lead- ers who can step ahead of the ' 1 white collar bri- gade\ and demand improvements in the nation. It is tb.e man who' can get away from training in any activity that makes a robot that is needed in America today. He who is co·ntent to act with a machine like group i~ only- preparing him~elf for that ldnd of life. It indicates that his part in politics will be that ef the man who acts . as a machine and follows the poHtical demagogue. The undergraduate who is• interested in his country will be a real citizen when he becomes •of: age. U'pon film wi11 rest: the policies of a nation. The student who bas gone through four years of <~ollege with the idea of maintaining old conser- position. For the past week tpe Bishop has been sleeping at the Y. W; C. A., oeing responsible for · · •'the' welf.are of all the assembled sistern. We hav~ it . from very good authority that he did a very commendable job and every 01re is' very happy in the feeling of absolut-e security. We thought that Tom Gi>uld and Ash Mitcnell; together with their respective forces, were tBking charge of these protective features· b'Ut apparently we are mis- taken. . During the footbalii season w:e all thought that Chippy Dain· was a v:er)'! brave· boy for, in spite of his small si2:e h'e gave some very stellar perform- ances. We ria.ine to the conclusion that what he lacked in size he mad~ up in courage but during the past week-en·d our ila:ith in• the boy was rude- ly shakened. Imagine our disappointment in see- ing this brave gridiron hero run away from. ''Hock of the North country,\- frightened to the extent that absolutely nothing· coull:f colD!: him from the safety of his room• orr the· sE!e'orid floor where, quite naturally, the female foot is never ,permit- ted to tread. Many pr.edict!i.ons were made by the onlookers as to the possible result if he had been caught by this sweet: young· thing but we leave our gentle readers· with· on:Iy the bare facts and will let them draw their own conclusions. About every other morning we notice Senator J. Peter .Judge, R. K., (Rich Kid) riding to class in the big open job, too tired to drive himself, even that short distanc·e. :Mariy of' us can remember way back when the Sena:tor's slim 1 athletic figure could be seen dashing about the campus defying wind and weather. But times have changed, and so has the Senator's figure. We implore him to get mor-e exer~ise and return to his normal shape, unless of course, he is int~nding to become a typ- ical school teacher. · ' · · · As this is my last coi'u':mn before the holiday,9 I take this opportunity of- wishing all my readers, gentle and otherw.i$e,e a v:ery pleasant v.acation to- gether with a Mercy Qhr.istmas and a Happy New Year. ::·.. . · · >' ·· -M.G. ~- .-, . . 'v~f:lye rules will still follow those rules later. 'NaturaJly this ty.pe of student is pleasing to the ' allege that is willing to sta.y in the background. But will this man.pr,o.ve his wm•th in- later y-ears? He will be content to follow others for the rest of his life, never having the ability to think for himself. The only contact a fbotba;ll team has· with the outside world is ·the ·trip~- it takes to play oth-er colleges. Does this in· any way bring the student outside the shell of his eoUege '? Does he i·n an¥ Way acquaint himself witq the outside world;? It is onlY through political discussions and debating so·cieties that the undergraduate can prepare him- self for future service to his fellow man. Of course Dean EJ.lery does not mean that footb~ll is the only reason a man should come to college, but football does not enat>le a student. to become that type of man which we need ln the world today. Does America desi!I'e football players· or states- men? A. :r. F. .---~~------------------ - i. (U.i .~·1.~ n·,···ut. ,·h-r fu ... ra ... ·II.

Accord- · ing to this clipping, \The great Handel, while in England, was de- prived of his audience because the performance of the 'Beggar's Op- era' was being held at the same time at the King's Theater.\ Like the Gilbert and Sullivan light operas; ·the \Beggar's Opera\ became popular because of its de- lightful contagious melodies and its strong satire, in the case of Gay directed against the Italian opera. The opera brought him money, fame, and scandal, and, although . he was later buried in Westminster Abbey, he was considered \the terror of ministers and one of the obstructions to the :peace of Eur- ope.\ At the MacDowell Colony me- morial concert broadcast last week the famous Mendelssohn Glee Club, which Ma<JDowell at one time di- rected, gave a splendid execution of his \Dance of the Gnomes,\ one of the most popular and difficult numbers on our Glee Club's rep- ortory last year.

Stewart, Jr. . ~ ; . \CRITICISM AND IMPROVEMENTS The modem college student is justified in the . critical and 'c:YDi()al ' attitude. which he assumes toward his· colleg-'e curricula and toward modern ' society. This idea was expressed by Dean Hawkes ' of Columbia who believes that this attitude is in ···a measure responsible for the genera:l rise in the · intellectual level ()t' the college man and, the im- provement of the collegiate curricula.. 011e might ex:pect that at a time when our whole .economic .order is being critically examined, that the college man should be in a questioning and djsturbed state of mind. The trend of pres- ·ent day thought seems to be an examination of the. forethought and judgment of the :preceding generation, and it is not surprising that \youth ·s·bould go on a mild debauch of criticism of every- thing in sight.'\ The presence ()f such a. flood of criticism will ,Oif necessity dern~:md much :patien.ce and good judgment ·by those who control' student aifairs. Last year marked several departures from the regular rolltille of student government a.t Union.. The formation of the Student Council o<icasioned. many new ideas which necessitated a eareful sAlection- With the presentation of the new·· plan of gotre:rnment the radical element of the eollege brought up many annoying criticisms · whicli''h'ad \to be Clealt with in as patient a man- ner as possible. Intelligent criticism is an indication of a su- perior student bod:y. The student proves that he possesses an ability greater than of mere assimi- lation. He demomstrates the ability to weigh critically. and to .advan<:e constructive suggestions o,f his own. Too often tEi.e student is completely indifferent or content· witb. ex::pressing his dissatisfaction 6y g-.tumbling to his fellow classmates. · . ~o measure bow much criticism has benefit- ted ~he curricula a:t Union is impossible, but it is safe to assume that some improvement has been made in this respe()t a.s a result of student opin- ion. . AJ3 a. result ()f the Improvement of the intel- lectual· .standards, which Dean Hawkes also be- llteves is an outgro-wth of the critical attitude of . the, modern student, we find many new depar- . tq.res in educati<>n. Examples of. these are the : ·many courses, which are being offered this year fo:r the fi,rj;jt ti~~ at many universities. The modern .college is -no longer content with presenting the student mere facts. Information is taught with reference to other information so that the stuqent understands the implications involved. With the rise .in level of the intellectual Ie.vel the arts college is becoming more and more complex. As the unou11t of knowledge increases, better relations. between the various fields of !earning are unea:rtlled and the student must have :a wider knowledge in order that he zp.ay really understand the iiLterrelation of facts. The ability :and intelligence {)f the student are taxed now n:tore than ever bef()re. We at Union have an excellent opportunity to pa.:r;tielpate in this :new attitude of criticism and stliggestion. Unioll has at present a relatively new administration which has proved itself Will· ing to eooperate with the. \'tudent . body in im- pr-ovement and in lleW' departures in the -curricula.. Fox the faculty t<> he antagonistic would be to dei'eat its own ends. But it must be remembered that such Improvement depends upon the iniative ,of the student. <'. w. it. Dear M.G.

Some object to his walking down the· middle aisle, -scooting- in and out of the pews ·and totally ignor- ing the p:eals of the organ. Saw Wiley try in vain to cl;tase Rick away this morning. The box- faced pup realized however that he only had one more bolt left and that the doors were closing. Ah, ha, .the Alpha Delts nearly caused Pro- fessor J'agu's heart to stop beating last week. It seems that tll.e boys have a new microphone at- tached to their radio. This contraption is located in the cellar of the house. Can you imagine any- thing nicer, when one speaks into the microphone the program coming in on the radio is halted? It seems that ()ne of the boys announced that the President of France had been assassinated. Pro- fessor .Tagu must hav:e done a triple somer,sault for in an in:;~tant he was right up tQ the loud speaker. One would think that he was going to go in and explore he was so near. Well you ean imagine the blood curdling moments of anxiety the gentleman must have gone through. EarUer in the week some of the boys in the know, had Bill Waldron, J'im Loomis and Crane in tears. (all, oh, I'll bet th.at was a pathetic sight) when they heard the announcement that T.a.ft 'School had burned down. In a few cays one can expect to see a persor:. parading aro11nd 'the streets of Schenectady under the disguise of a Santa Clause out-fit. Then of course Den Moulton might be surrounded by a. happy group of youngsters all hoping that Don (alias good old Santa) will hear their requests. Say Don if you need a few reindeers I know sev- eral prancers who are trying to horn-in at the \Northern Institution.\ · Here is some serious news you might' be inter- ested in. The D. U's had a very serious and grave session in their chapter room this week. The :purpose was to receive all suggestions- as to the manner by which they could: possibly .clear the horizon of the \OLD DILAPIDATED BARN\ lo- cated at the end of the red brick walk dire(Jtly in back of their ch(Y)ter house. You can't imagine just how serious the situation has beep made by the protests .Of a third house-the Phi Gamins. tt seems that tl)e latter house stores their roosters and cabbage heads in THE OLD BARN. May I suggest that both the D. U's and the Phi Gamms saunter up to the Barracks on the hill and seek aid. I'm sure those so-called military men could bring in to use the \Big Berthes\ and in about five minutes the dispute could be settled. Just received a :prize bit of news. It is sup- posed to be very confidential but since it con- cerns so conspicuous a personage as William George, I know most of you w:ill relish its con- tent. It seems that the moment Bi11 arrives at the Bums Ball tomorrow night a committee under -the supervision of Bill Mark will watch his every move. As I understand it Willie will hold the multitude s:pell bound from his perch at the top of the stairs using as his theme the following lines from Tennyson's \Lotos-Eaters\- A land of streams some, like a. downward smoke Slow-dropJ)ing veils of thinnest lawn, did go; And some thr{)' wavering lights and shadows broke, · Rolling a slumberous .sheet of foam below.
