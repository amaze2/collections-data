PROF. LOISETTE'S MEMORY DISCOVERY. Prof. Loisette's new system of memory training, taught by correspondence at 2!37 Fifth .Avenue, New York, see1ns to supply a general want.

R. Harper, of Yale, etc., place the claim of Prof. Loisette upon the highest ground.

Putnan1's Sons have lately begun under the . name of \:Knickerbocker Nuggets.\ The titJe of this book is at first misleading. Not only the fables of Rome, but those of nearly every ancient country as well,. contribute their share in the formation of this singular collection. The source and progress of fic- tion.. and other kindred subjects, are discussed by thrre imaginary lit<3rati. At intervals throughout the discussion the fables, which never fail in pointing a moral, are introduced. ''The Trials of Eustace,\ '·The Three Caskets,\ to which a portion of the ''Merchant of Venice'' bears a striking resemblance, and '~J ovinian, the Proud Emperor,\ are some of the best and most pleasing of the legends. Other \nug- gets\ soon to appear are ''Gulliver's Travels,'' ''Tales from Irving,\ and the \Vicar of Wakefield.\
