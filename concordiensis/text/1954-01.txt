The Gaudie' of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland seems to have the same .problem that is so known throughout our own college.

And such was the high standard of manhood that one only needed to participate in a single rag during one':, undergraduate career-there were always more individualists fol- lowing immediately 1 behind.\ \What have varsity rags to do with this? Thinlt deeply and the answer is-everything. The people who carry out these apparently mad .pranks are not the harum- scarum, scatterbrained individuals they are usually considered to be. They are men and women who are not afraid to use thei-r brainil, whose thougi)_ts ar.e not confined to the commonly accepted rut, but are capable of conceiving original ideas, and what is more important, of putting these ideas into practice. They instill what can only l;>e de- scribed as \pep\ into their thoughts and actions.\ ment by \proper quiet, methodical Dewey called on American Uni- means.\ Although he did not men- varsities to \do battle for the cause tion names, the Governor openly of free inquii:y;\ He said the hunt refuted the methods, and morals fOJ; Communists at hom.e need of Wisconsin Senator Joseph Me- never damage the reputation of the earthy and his compatriots calling innocent, or hinder \untra attention to a \small but vocal exploration of intellectual ·or sci- group who Would sacrifice liberty enti.fic inquiry and teacl}ing.\ in order to defeat its enemies.\ ·The gove!)nor's stand -comes on A Great Step Forward vVhy do people talk about \servicP-men\, \men-in-indus- try'', and then glibly refer to males of the same age as \col- lege-boys'?\ One reason is that we have not convinced the community that we can conduct ourselves as adults. The cause of this rnay be that our administrators do not treat us like men, and what they expect, they get. \To-day what do we find? In stu- dent life the word \apathy\ has be- come almost hackneyed with over- use, And that dreadful word ap- plies to every single aspect of our existence at University.

Some say this condition is a vicious circle. Our admin- istxation has proved they ·will go half \vay with the students of this college toward the solution of common problems. The ()range Juice committee was an outstanding success in this 1·ealm. Now, \\·e are on the verge of submitting to the Trus- tees a proposal to improve what has been perhaps the most vexing and yet most delicate college 1·estriction-the liquor rule. If the HPC and the Student Council succeed in having the regulations liberalized it will be a sensational step for- ward-for the administration. It will demonstrate that they are willing to allow us adult social privileges. That will give us more freedom than most American Colleges. \Now in 1954, Aberdeen Univer- sity has within its walls some 2,000 student's not one of whom has real vitality and personality. A small number cram furiously for exams years ahead, the majority merely drift aimlessly from class to class and chatter idly over endless cups of coffee. There is only one word which adequately describes the life we are leading-stagnation! \And don't 'sit smugly agrPPing with everything you read.

Readers of thi.;; article myst realize that the success of the \Two-Way Trust\ will depend entirely upon our individ- ual self-restraint in social conduct. We must realize that the effect of alcohol does not terminate when Fraternity doors close and you open a car door to drive your escort bacl{ to Skidmore. The Concordiensis firmly believes that the overwhelm- ing majority of l!nion men are ready to regulate their own social behavior, observing the rules of good taste rather than arbitrary restrictions which satisfy no one. If, however, a few babies cannot resist the urge to get so drunk as to become obnoxious, we will lose our privileges, the Trustees will lose confidence, the Administration will lose patience, and all chance for progress will be lost for a ·long time to come. ''T\ Is for Tulip Bowl We trust there will be no heart-rending disappointment if we announce officially: \There is no Tulip Bowl.\ We must C'Onfess that it all started when certain members of the staff, inspired by New Year football fever; thought it would be good fun to see if Union could take a joke. · Reactions seemed to be exceedingly normal. l\Ian v im- med~ate~y recognized it could be nothing but a prepost.erous fabncatwn. Some were about to leave for Knoxville but re- read the article and reconsidered. A few thought the paper had carried things too far and were disturbed. Almost every- one had a good laugh. Such criticism as was voiced was serious, well founded, and probably correct. We are glad you look for 100 pei'cent truth and honesty in a newspaper, that you expect it to fight for what it considers right. While you may be a bit disappointed with :vour local paper after graduation, you may safely rely upo~ the Con- cordiensis to maintain, henceforth, its traditionally high standards of news coverage, student representation, integ- rity, and moral honesty. Please do not expect perfection. No newspaper, profes- sor, college, church, government, or political party can offer you that. But, do demand a high standard and let us know if we do not come up to it. If everyone now is conscious of what a newspaper should be, then we \von the Tulip Bowl. -H. L. S. * * . We ca~not state too strongly that this paper stands squarely he- hmd the nght of tts members to express the~r opinions in print. We ar·e prepared to take the consequences for what eYer appears on these pages, both individually and as a body. The pBrsons that sl'e fit to take unauthorized action to demonstrate their disapproval must also be ready to take the consequences. Officially, the newspaper reserves judgement on last night's scalp- ing incident until the proper authorities have had their say. -THE EDITORS Letters to the Editor from the Faculty CONCORDIENSIS, Editor, CONCORDIENSIS Editor, Dear Sir: Dear Sir: The Union College Campus Chest should represent for our students a counterpart of what the Com- munity Chest means for .Schenec- tady or any of the other hundreds of towns and cities of America which combine their philanthropic- charitable campaigns into one united drive. Putting \all their eggs in one basket\ saves time and energy for the organizations rais- ing funds, and at the sarr:e time saves time and money for the donorS'. I have seen cities find a new community of spJrit, a new sense of living and working to- gether for common goals, as a re- sult of a Community Chest cam- paign; I have also seen college campuses similarly ingpired. The control committee provides the guarantee that funds given will not be -poured down ratholes such as the \racket charities\ recently publicized in the papers. To me, giving to charitable ac- tivities is one of the great privileges of a democracy, It is im- portant that rr:any of our organiza- tions should be maintained by funds not collected in the form of taxes~ if we are to avoid totali- tarianism. Even undergraduate college students have some money which is not committed to abso- lute necessities, and it is wise to start the habit of charitable con- tribut.ions as an educational pre- paratten for full participation as a citizen. Remember, there are no campus -chests behind the iron Curtain. -Carter Davidson I feel compelled to comment on the complaint aired at the Tippe- canoe Co·nference that engineering laboratories run overtime. All laboratory experiments at UNION are carefully designed ex- perimentS' and the time aspect is a part -of the design. There is no need for a group to be overtime if they come to the laboratory prop- erly prepared and if they work carefully in the laboratory. Difficulty arises for the few (or many) students who al'rive at the laboratory half asleep, completely unfamiliar with 'the work to -be done. Further difficulty arises for the few who feel th!J.t the labora- tory experiment is too difficult if they are required to thlnk while in laboratory. Poor choice of in- struments, poor application of in- struments, poor sej,ection of data points, incorrect assumptions, and· vague records of data taken are all causes of wasted time in the laboratory. Take a look around you in laboratory. You'll find that the students who come prepared and worlt carefully in laboratory are leaving early.
