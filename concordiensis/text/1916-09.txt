Men From Actively Infested Districts Barred. WILL NOT ENTER UNTIL OCTOBER 2 . Expected That Ruling Will Af- fect About Fifty-Five Men. Because of the poliomyelitis epidemics in several localities from which Union men come, and of the earnest efforts the Sche- nectady Health Department has been making to keep the city free from the plague, many of the col- lege authorities were much in favor of postponing the opening of college until October 4th. It was only after the matter had been taken up with the city and state officials that it was de- rided to open on the original date. The condition was made, how- ever, that men from actively in- fected districts were not to be ad- mitted until October 2nd. According-ly the following letter was addressed to each stu- dent and sub-freshman by Presi- dent Richmond : UNION COLLEGE: In view of the inquiries re- p-arding a possible chang-e of date for the opening of Union College because of th~ epid- emic of infantile paralysis in the st\te the authorities of the college desire to announce that the college will open, as sched- uled in the catalogue, on Sep- tember 18. This action is taken with the sanction of the New York State Board of Health and the Board of Health of the city of Sche- nectady. It is understood ' however, that students coming from communities actively in- fected will not be allowed to reg-ister until 'two weeks later. In such cases the colleg-e will arranP\e for special instruction that these students may not suffer seriously by the delay. At the suggestion of the local Board of Health it is required that every student furnish a cer- tificate of health signed by some reputabl~ physician. Special notice will he sent to students coming from infected districts. If no further notice is received they may assume that no objection will be raised to their registration. The city of Schenectady has enjoyed remarkable immunity from the epidemic and parents may be. assured of the utmost (Continued on page 5) Top Row-Whitner, DeLaplante, L. Bowman, P.

It is understood that about 55 men v:rill fall under this ruling and wlll not enter college· until October . . President Richmond, interview- ed by a CON CORDI EN SIS rep- resentative at the conclusion of the faculty meeting Friday night, said that the college is taking this stand in the matter in order to comply with the wishes of the State Board of Health. He em- phasized the fact that students al- ready in Schenectady do not necessarily have to leave the city, but simply remain off the campus until two weeks' time has expired since they left their infected dis- tricts. Thus, men who have been in the city a week need only ab- sent themselves from classes dur- ing this week to fulfill the require- ments of the ruling. Condition examinations for those who were unable to take them at the regular time· will be held on Friday and Saturd~y. October 5 and 6. It is understood that the class work lost by these men during their absence will be made up through personal ar- rangement with their several pro- fessors. * ..

FIFTEEN MEN R.EGISTER FOR ADVANCE DEGREES .. Three Union Graduates Are in': · List. ·• Freshman Class Given Advice in First Chapel Service. President Richmond gave his usual welcome to the freshmen in chapel service Thursday, althou~h he failed to tell them that they were the best prepared class thus far. He warned them not to judge the whole college bv the sopho- more class. He told them, how- eYer, that in the course .of time they might even develop into such as they. He advised them not to shirk their work but put first things first. The faculty, he said, were their friends and not their enemies and were only too willing to help them in all difficulties. \A real man is not afraid to stand up for his ideals,\ and he asked them not to change their former ideals too readily, but to be acclimated and then to decide on some good course. \Don't follow the crowd because they are different, for thev may be wrong,\ was his conciud- i ng Warning.

He is reputed one of the best centers in the smaller col- leges this season. The team's of- fensive power lies in the three regular backfield men, Parker at left-half, Pollard at right-half, and Randall at fullback. Whitney · and Dower are also good g•round gainers, and both may be seen at right-half before the game is over. Bresnahan, a fast, heady player will lead the team at quart- er.
