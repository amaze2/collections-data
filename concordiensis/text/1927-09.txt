It is a field of endeavor, of constant striving f01· knowledge and wisdom. In it YO'l must play the lmgest part. No one can edu- cate you but yout·selL You will only get out of colleg-e what you put into it. Union Col- lege, in adn1itting you, believes that you are of the calibre wol'thy of what it has to offer: its equipme11t, its instt·uctors, its traditions, its name. You, alone, cttn prove that you merit such a p1·ivilege. Since you started fot· college yo.u have doubtless h.ad much advice thrust upon you. We will briefly add om bit. You have begun four years that will probably have a greater influence upon your life than any other equal period of time. Of yom p1·esent number, many will no longer be with you when you gradu- ate. The \vay is hard aml long-. We have but one word of advice: use yom· ea1·s and your eyes and yout· mind, tuko fast hold of every bit of information you can get while adjusting yourselves to your life here. Use your ears and your mind during yom· college years. And when you have gone nut into the world, use your ears and yom· eyes and you1· mind. BIGGER, PERHAPS BETTER Radical ~changes nmrk the beg-inning of the 51st year of The Concordiensis. The former size has, afie1· five Yl'al·s, been discarded for the p1·escnt sheet. It was the belief in 1922 that there was suffici~nt nE:'ws in the college to warrant a six page semi-weekly paper with five columns to the pag-e. A careful ~heck shows that such a condition has never existed. It has, however been found that in the past two years increased news and .advet·tising was making necessary an average of ten pages a week. It is the opinion of the Board that the present pape1· of six 17-inch cohH1111S to the page, which falls in size between the former four and six page issues, will be adequate to cover complete- ly the news of the campus. The history of publications at Union is ex- ceedingly inte1·esting. Started in 1876 as a literary magazine, The Concordiensis has since that time g-one throug-h continual changes. With any advancement it is often necessary to disregard a 11 1 ruthlessly cast off old forms. Thus small <tttention will now be given to sym- metry of make-up, but on the other hand strict typographical standanls will ue attempted, new heads will be used and an effort will be made to publish mm·e pictures. There are many \\:ho deplm·e the apparent degeneration of the colleg.e paper from a liter- ary magazrne into a semi-weekly tabloid. We, too, often reg-1·et the chang-e but have been im- pressed all too vividly in the past with the almost utter lack of student writings possess- ing real Uterary merit. We shall, however. attempt to J~etain in some part this heritag-e of The Concordiensis by running various feature THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, :SEPTEMBER 20, 1927 (\(\Let the Grecian Dream \ * * * * According to the Fresh Bible, the :Grecian has been: dreaming since 1856 and as yet few of his pleasantries or disillusionments have found expression. As. F.L.S. woul<l say \What Of It\ but F.L.S. is not here, his \W Of It\ h~s deserted the C 0 ncordy columns, and tlte Grecian dreams on. Perhap~ his :dreams will be pleasant; perha)ils they will not .but whatever they ma:y be, ·trtay they find concrete expression here. \Let the Grecian Dream.'' * * * * And we, too, arc supposed to say something ahout a perfectly normal opening of college. Of course wc'l\c glad you're all here. And we're glad to be here ourselves. Now we'¥c said everything there is to say . * * * * PersonaHy, we find this business of freshman rushing most amusing. Yesterday and today and tomorrow we observe the mighty upperclassmen and the almost- mighty sophomores fa,lling over each other in their efforts to make the dear freshies think they are little kings. But any throne .is at best a tottering structure. 'l'hree weeks from now the mighty upper-classmen and the almost-mighty sophomores will be fa:!ling O\'er each <:>ther in thrir efforts to sock the daylights out of the littlt digits. * * * * We dread to think of the vociferous roar that will go up from the student body when they cast their l111mps over the new Concordy. It may bo summarized tersely in \Grape-Nuts.\ Perhaps it isn't \Graft\ af.ter all. 1laybe the Board imagines it can publish a news- paper, * * * * Some statistician should see a golden opportunity before him now. We have as yet ·had no statistics on the number of words of gratis advice handed out to the freshmen. \Von't some kind-hearted soul favor us with his estimate?· * * * * We note that the telephone m1mbers of Skidmore Russell Sage, State Teacher's and the Albany Busines~ College have been deleted from the new College Blotter. The matter should be investigated immediately. We are sure there is some great motive behind this far-reaching act. 'vVas the marriage rate too high at Union last year? Is this a subtle retaliation upon the Schenectady Rotten Transit for raising its rates? Is there an attempt on foot to make all Unionists celibates? Does the BP II Telephone want its books used up sooner? Is diss a system? Or did whoever concocted the Blotter make a slight oversight? * * * * Really, we must say something about the opening of co liege, or at least about the freshmen who have just witnessed their first opening. What is there to say about the frosh? They are normal, too. But there are a lot of them. 297 to be exact. Lean on<>s; small ones, fat ones, tall onrs . Light ones, dark ones, and red-heads. Californians, New Yorkers, Porto Ricans, Schenec- tadians, and Engineers. * * * * Speaking of numbers, the Skidmore emollment has been increased, according to reports, to 544, to meet the corresponding increases at Cnion. This is certainly intercollegiate cooperation and the dating prospects to the north are again returning to normalcy. * * * * The football squad is to be congratulated on winning the cane rush for the Sophomores. Cheer up, frosh! They'll win it fot you next year. * * * * \!; Now that the Idol Fight is over, the Dempsey fight is the nex:t one.

A. introduced: , :Mr. Otis and Mr . .Nb ell, :gradua.tes of, :last J.une who are now -members of' the faculty of the college. These two, ··spoke to the .frosh on \Scholarship :Standards\ the former speaking from , the engineering point of ¥iew and the :latter from the academic. M·r. Otis, ·:showed that a definite set of standa-rds . .was necessary in engineering because ·of ·the technicality invol-ved, and pointed out that the en-gineer -tnust be 'on the job steadily. He stressed the \mportance of hard work and .study' . early in the course because the ad- '· vanced steps a-re aU dependent on . ·'the prima-ry ones, Whil'e the succeed- ;' ing phases all interlock very closely. Mr. Abell said that an academic • 'education allowed one to associate :, with people endowed with ·the utmost . learning. Although the benefits ob' · tained from the arts .course are slight· ly more superficial, a nwre solid foundation for later -life is obtained by the student. It is u.p to the A. B. to set his own standards, which wili 'Vary with the individual. Everyone 'should take a few homs at some time during one's college career and think over ideals and scholarship standards for one'sself. They are not alreauy . '>et as in the case of an engineer, Mr. ·Abell pointed out. Dean Ellery addressed the new men Saturday mor-ning on \Campus Manners\ reading scvel'al passages , from the \Laws of l 1 nion College'', a book published by the faculty in r8o2 on manners prescribed for stu- .· dents ·and the punishments for -the violations of these custonis. Although ·many of the points seem very ridicu- lous now, one d.nrlot escape the im- . pression that 125 years ago certain· :manners were requi~ed as important to be cultivated .by college men. Dean Ellery also spoke of manners in the English Universities and showed that manners are just as important to the . :well-bred man now as they ever were.

Hosannas to the Highest! The cus- tomary foolishness is put away for another year save fo1· the feeble ~nd sickly remnants that hang on through the first months, consist- ing of innumemble thnmts of haircuts and a few spiritless snowballings. One of the troubles with traditions is that they may be outgrown. The haditional scrapf> are based }Jrimarily on the id€a that college men are \hm·d guys\ and must take the baby- ishness out of the new men. In the old days it was a sort <>f initiation into the ranks of col- lege toughs who guz_zled much beer, yodelled sentimental s()ngs, and affected scraggly mus- taches. Also, to be sure, the soph01nores must show their su:pel'iority while showing the fresh- men they are 11ot so hot. But it is to be doubted that a sock: on the beezer will make a fresh- man think mw Lhe better of the sophomoreR who do the socking·, in a timid manner, or of the .iuniors .and seniors who stand off to one side and ye 1l for blood and gore.

Ii:~ntlall TI:ESDAY, S!·:l''l'E:.I-IBEH 27, 1927 Saturday maxked something more than the successful opening of the football season. The St. Lawre11ce game was the first athletic con- test to which applied the new rule concerning passes approved by the Athletic Board in its spring meeting. No passes were given to the members of the football squad. To a certain few, perhaps, this may appear to have been carrying matters too far, to be depriving members of the team of theil· right- ful dues. That idea has become current met·ely because it has been customary for so long- to g-ive passes to the membet·s of the squad that we have come to accept it as the natural and right thing· to d.o. 'l'he Athletic Board seems to us to have bee11 acting in the right direction. Athletics have become such a large part of the activities of every college, have been criticized so much, have occupied to such a degree the attention of the public, that it has been necesf;ary slowly to build up some code of conduct. One of the tenets of this code is that professionalism in colleges is to be frowned upon. We ourselves do not like to play colleges who have the slight- est tinge of \buying\ their athletes. There are other fai ntet· suspicions of what is considered professionalism. The practice of giving pa::;ses to the players is one of them. We all know that many pla;vers in the past sold their pas'H~::<. They were thus receiving what really amountl'd to money for playing. B.v abolishing the p<tss fm· players the Athletic Bom·d has stopped one of the surviving ele- ments of professionalism at Union. It is fol- · lowing the steps of Harvard, Yale and Prince- ton. Incidentally, with fe·wer free admissions the gate receipts should be larger ·and we must keep : in mind that it costs money to put a team of aBy kind on the field. The request fl'Dm a member of the adminis- tration that the students refrain from walking on the g-rass is well taken. But against it W€' , make a .request of our own. It is well enough to ask the undergTaduates to keep off the grass, providing 01!1~· that there is some other place = :: ::. - - = - - -· - ~Let the Grecian Dream·~ ~· -~ ~~ ... - -- - -- - -- In s.pitr of the fact that the No-DPa·l :\grerment \\'as not n·<ed at the first Student Body Hl<'L'ting, the <lea\s got well nnd<>rway without its aitl and the po]:itkal pot has lll'etl boiJ.i.ng- merrily t-hrm1g·h tht• class t•lt•ctions. * * * !\}\'·aking of electim1s, a noye>Jty .has crept int0 our lllidst.

Let us Lake an example. We m·e all pleased more or less :with Bailey I Iall. There is, however, one fault that all of us find with its location, it is built in a cui de sac as fm· as reaching it from other parts of tne campus is concerned. There is no dil'ect pathway fl'o)n it to the l\Iemorial chapel. In selecting a route from the one building to the other, one has the choice of going along South lane Ol' North lane. But we are aU prone to · take the shortest way, which lies across the • sacred grass and the so-called faculty tennis . COUTts.
