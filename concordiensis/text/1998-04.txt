The team now enters anew stage in their devel9pment al- though they continue to row in the same waters that brought them success as a club. This past Saturday morning with a strong breeze blowing off the familiar river, the Union Crew team launched off into uncharted waters as it began its first season as a varsity sport. To coincide with the momentous occasion, the team officially unveiled its new state-ofthe-,art boathouse located about three quarters of a mile away from the campus in the his- torical Stockade District of Schenectady. _ \The idea of the boathouse has been kicked around for six or seven years, it came about as a result of President Hull's support, vision, and determination to get it done,\ said head coach Tom White. The boathouse has become much more than a vision for this growing team. For over a year, the crew team had to lay their boats on a field, and before that the was where called hom e.

Patrik Union College Faculty \Nobody talks about race on this campus.\ Have you heard this comment before? This ob- servation about Union's curtain of silence about race has been made by both blacks and whites, for example, by Dean Williams, who is African-American, by Rachel Sheriff, who is one of the white Peer Facilitators, and by Dean Lundquist, who is white and head of the Admissions Office. Why don't we talk about race? Are we afraid? Are we indiffer- ent? Are we happy with the way things are at Union? Some people are not happy. At a faculty meeting last fall, Dean Alford reported that one of the main reasons why students trans- fer out of Union is \lack of diver .. sity.\ They find the campus too homogeneous and too comfort- able in its homogeneity.

Campus News (!hmcnxhi~n!fllis • April 9, 1998 • Page 3 A Smoky, Sobering Saturday by FrankRossi Staff Writer Yes, this is another story which involves trips to Ellis Hospital, but the events leading up to it could. have happened to anyone. At I 0:56PM on Saturday night, room 227 in West College caught fire from a malfunctioning Phillips/ Magnavox CD\box\ and caused a small amount ·of SI!loke and soot damage to the northern wing ofthe floor. Freshmen residents David Weiner and John Van Wormer, who both were away from the building, were asked to sleep elsewhere for the weekend, as were residents of three surrounding .rooms. Had it not been for the heroics of Campus Safety, the damage would have been much worse. Campus Safety officer Robert Tomack was one ofthe first tore· spond to the incident While at· tempting to evacuate the building, Tomack said, \By the time I came around the comer .[of the northern wing], the smoke was over waist high. I have never seen anything like it.\ Fellow officer Ed Teller, who also arrived early on the scene, had trouble seeing anything in the smoke-laden ha11, but that did not stop him from lending a big hand. \I heard popping and crackling to the right ofthe door, so I grabbed a fire extinguisher andput out the flames.\ Teller, who was visibly overcome and sickened by the smoke after he exited the building, was later taken to Ellis Hospital, as wasTemack. On November 1, a next-door room, West 229, also experienced a fire in a portable fan. According te the fire report, the fan's motor apparently overheated, leading to some are that the two events are somehow linked, Campus Operations' David Grzybowski said they are likely unrelated, although the exact cause of Saturday's fire is still un- known. \It is tough to pinpoint. All of the electrical systems. are up to code, but to go the extra mile, we are getting a piece of equipment to test the circuits in the buHd- ings.\ Campus Safety rep()fted that students inside the building coop- erated fully in escaping harm's way. Second-floor resident Sloan Miller, who was in the building during the alarm, said, \When we heard the alarm, we thought it was a drill and were joking that we hoped it wouldn't take long. As we walked by, we went out ofthe exit near the came quiet and realized it was a real fire.\ The first and second floors were visibly smoky from the outside of the building, but the true damage of the fire was not realized until the Deputy Fire Chiefbrought the ste- reo outside. The stereo was badly warped with compact disc cases melted on top of it. Students out- side the scene were allowed tore- turn around 11 :45 PM after watch- ing a fire hose and large fans get transported to and from West. The· northern wing of the floor was fiHed wi1h soot, and room 227 looked extremely charred. Its ceil- ing tiles and walls were mostly blackened, but because of Taylor's fast action, Weiner and Van Wormer were a:ble to sa:lvage some clothing and electronic equipment as the fire bose did not have to be used. Residents of the third and fourth floors still complained about the charred smell well into Sunday, but most residents did sleep in West the same night. Professional cleaners were scheduled to help remove the soot and the lingering smell from the northern wing on Monday afternoon following an insurance inspection. The resi- dents of the three other rooms were expected to reoccupy their rooms on Tuesday night. West 227 will be vacated for the remainder of the term, and the roommates have been offered liv- ing arrangements in West or Fox basement by Residence Life. Fire inspectors immediately focused their investigation on the stereo and collected pertinent information from it. Campus officials have stated that all parties involved will be com- pensated for any losses, although the exact insurance report was not available at press time. Rose Ousted ccntinued from page 1 \not going to discuss personnel issues.\ Although the Dean's office is · not releasing details concerning the decision, Alford a~d Rose have a history of disagreement, and ac- cording to Rose, in an interview with 1he Concordiensis, \The Dean and I have never agreed philo- sophically on the place of a Stu- dent Activities Program in a liberal arts environment.\ Also, when Rose was asked if he worked better with the adminis- tration or with the students, he quickly replied \the students.\ It is no secret that there is a past his- tory of tension between Rose and the administration, so his dismissal comes as no great shock to those in the know. However, Rose him- self was \surprised at the timing of this, coming as it does six weeks after the birth of our second child.\ Th'e reasons behind Alford's decision not to renew Rose's con- tract cannot be confirmed by either side, but at the end of the Fall 1997 term, three members of the Student Forum went to Alford's office to complain about Rose. Student Forum President Christopher Brantigan, Senior Class Vice Presi- dent Frank Rossi, and Junior Class President Tom Marino expressed -----------------.......,..--....------.----------------------------1 their concern about many issues Schaffer Library Ope1,1 For Business by Shaun Montana Staff Write/.' With the start of Spring Term, the new, expansion portion of Schaffer Library is open to the cam- pus community. The old building, which is now undergoing renova- tion, has been closed off and is ex- pected to be ready by Fall Term 1998. The new building is an im- pressive structure; as one student commented, \Now it looks like Union has a 21st Century library.\ The building has been designed to offer the best functionality to t11e College. A11 evidence indicates it wi11 serve this purpose well. Even though the new building is complete, Schaffer Library itself will not be finished until the old building's renovation is done. As such, the current setup and use of tlte new building is temporary. For example, the door currently being used as the entrance is only tem- porary, and the old entrance will be in use in the Fall. The location cfthe circulation desk, directly in- side the door, is also temporary. The electronic reference worksta- tions, now located- in the atrium, will also be moved to the front of the library when the renovation is completed. According to Cara Molyneaux, Head of Administra- tive Services, the o]d building is virtually gutted. The construction of office spaces on the old fourth floor (which will corre~pond to the new third floor) has already be- gun. The mezzanine in the old building is scheduled to be re- moved in the next few weeks. This wilJ keepequallevels between the old building and the new expan- sion. With the new expansion open comes many questions. Locations of library materials can be found af,::cording to printed directories available at the circulation desk. The basement is the same as it was before Spring Break, and contains many books and periodicals. Spe- cial Collections, which was unavail· able throughout Winter Term, is open again on the new building's third floor. The periodical reading room currently contains no periodi\ cals, but these will be added in the next few weeks. As the whole li- brary is not complete, nothing has been taken out of storage. Students and faculty must continue to re· quest materials as they did during Winter Term until the library is com- plete in the Fall. The new expansion is the per· feet place on campus to get work done. The furniture, chosen by the architect, matches the interior of the expansion very well. About 70 study desks are currently in the new expansion. There are also numerous chairs and tables avail- able for studying. According to Molyneaux, not alJ of the furniture has arrived yet.

Included in these issues were the amount of time that Rose spent in the office, the atmosphere in the Student Activities Office, and an alleged misappropriation of.funds in association with the purclmse of a Macintosh Pov, erBook 1400 lap-top computer. After Brantigan, Rossi, and Marino's initial visit to Alford, Alford met with many members of the Student Forum and Program Assistants, to \research the valid- ity of the allegations\ against Rose, said Program Assistant and Vice President of Academic Affairs Andy Markowski. Program Assis- tants are students hired by Student Activities to help run events put on the office. Alford met with a good base of the Student Forum and discussed the issues brought before him. One can only assume the impact that these meetings had on Alford's decision not to rehire Rose, as neither Alford nor any students that Concordiensis con- tacted would speak concerning what actually was said in these dis- cussions. As soon as Rose learned ·Of the allegations against him, he imme- diately appeared before the Stu- dent Forum to address the con- cerns of Brantigan, Rossi, and Marino. At this meeting, Rose \wanted to know, worried about the concerns, and attempted to solve the problems,\ said Michael Winn, Program Assistant and Vice Presi- dent of the Sophomore Class. Rose, as a father of two children and an active adjl.lnct professor here, said that he had a tight sched- ule, hut, according to Winn, would try to \spend much more time in the office.\ Another allegation brought for- Contit~ued on page 5

(A calendadisting these discussions will be distributed r1extweek.) The Student Fo- rum Kick-offthis past Tuesday in Old Chapel began the Dialogues on Race with recita- tions of the n-arratives describing racial ex- periences a11d incidents on campus. These narrati·ves were submitted anonymously by students, fac11l ty and staff. These narra- tives were rncea.nt to provide the inspiration and topics for the student-led discussions to be held around campus during the first two weeks ufthe Dialogues. The Athletic Department coaches have already beg;u11 meeting with their teams to discuss race. Because of the special cama- raderie am()n~team members and the guid- ance of coaches, these discussions can ex- plore issues ,C>f race honestly by virtue of the trust an<! commitment the athletes and coaches have created over months and years ofwolrk_iag closely together.

They will' contrast the stereotyped im- ages that the white majority have of them with the truth about themselves and their lives. The seco11dl half of the four-week series of Dialogues en Race will be organized by faculty, administrators and staff. Many fac- ulty will be discussing race in their classes, and some fa<eulty will be holding discussion sessions out!ii<le of class. For example, sev- eral of the Fresh man Preceptorial professors will devote class sessions to race and ask their students to write their own narratives about race. O.ne or two Biology professors will discuss the biological aspects of race in their classes. One of the Political Science professors is teaching a whole course on race. One .of the Geology professors iswork- illg on a class session concerning climate Dialogues on Race Committee. and race. Examples of out-of-class discus- sions include two Economics professors leading a discussion on wage differentials related to race, a History professor leading a discussion on Union's social scene as it is related to race, and another History profes- sor leading a discussion on the definition of race. Other faculty-led discussions are cur- rently being organized. The faculty-led discussions that are open to all members of the Union community- staff, students, administrat~rs, faculty and alumni-will be listed on a schedule for the last two weeks of the Dialogues on Race. This schedule will be posted on the college's web page and it will be distributed to all stu- dents and employees next week. Members Paul D'Annibale I TC of the staff will be able to attend these dis- cussions and still receive their pay, thanks to an agreement worked out with President Hull. The closing activity of the Dialogues on Race will be organized by the Peer Facilita- tors.

THE NOn MEMORIAL ·::>· A MINERVA LECTURE been given voice,. once the curtain of silence about race has been lifted at Union. Many student leaders have been working hard on organizing and advertising the vari- ous discussions that are part of the Dia- logues on Race. Beth Wierzbieniec and Umang ·Desai from Student Forum have planned the schedule, organized the Kick- offrecitation of narratives, and created most of the publicity for the Dialogues. Karena Cronin, Rachel Sheriff, and Jen: Chick from Pe.er Facilitators have organized the first two weeks of student-led discussions with twenty-one student gl'oups on campus, ar- ranged for the training ofthe students who wiH lead these discussions, and also worked on publicity. Peggy Sarnedi has worked on organizing the \Speak Out\with ALAS and CELA. JonZandmanand Ibrahim Adamu, along with other members.oftheisraeli Cui~ tme Club and Alpha Phi Alpha, have worked on ways to model how ethnically diverse groups can come together for honest dis- cussion about race. Many students from MAG (Multi-cultnral Advisory Group) and other student groups have been actively involved in creating these Dialogues on Race and in publicizing them. No more silence. Get involved. Discus- sion is a powerful agent for change. Talking and listening penetrate the mind and affect the mind morethan chemicals can, especially when it comes to long-tenn changes. Racial attitudes are mental; they won't be changed by taking a pill or a drink. Racist behavior,. or even indifferent behavior, springs from our attitudes; such behavior won't he changed by continuing to be silent about what we have been doing. Before we can make Union more diverse, we need to talk about race- about the problems, the ten- sions and the opportunities we have here concerning race.

Latino Heritage Month, like Black History Month, is an opportunity for the organizations on campus to join together. African.and Latino AUiance of Students and Circulo Estudiantil Latino Americano have teamed11p for their secolld annual celebration of Latino Heritage Month at Union College. This month will give the C()l]ege com- munity an opportunity to learn 1n ore al>o ut us and see wit at things we cherish and hold dear. What tltoughts does one have on Latino Heritage?

Each Latino culture is vastly differtnt from the next an(J each group immensely proud o.f its own roots,. Despite the cultural differences, \Ve Latinos do have many things itl common, the first being we all belong from a colonial past. Our countries have been \invaded\ by others and that is an integral part of who we are. The road for Latifios to self dis- cover themselves has been long. The pain of progress is culturally and economically distressing for many Latinos around the world. Latinos are also bound by a common language, Spanish, the language of the invaders. But like American English, we have left an imprint on the language all our own. If you listen closely, you can tell a Cuban or Dominican from a Puerto Rican, a Mexican from an Argentinian and so on. It's all in the accent. Latinos are also bound by their unity and care for each other. Spanislt-speaking people love to read and hear about other Spanish-speaking people and cul- tures. As Latinos we have become a very proud culture which has been around for hundred of years before EngHsh was spoken in . America. One can assure that Latinos will be around ·for hun-· dreds of years to come .. This is just a brief overview of who we are. I hope the college community is enlightened and will \ participate in at least one or two events throughout the month. We sincerely hope that many will at- tend the l'ectute by the keynote speaker of the month, .Felipe Luciano.

Inci- . dentally, when Rose went on pa- tetnity leave in February, he left the 'lap-top in the office. Regardless of the actions by Brantigan, Rossi, Marino, or any member of Student Forum, over the nine years Rose served as Student Activities Director, there existed tension between the administration and Rose. Alford refused comment wl1en asked how influential the visit by Brantigan, Rossi, and Marino and the consequent meetings with the Student Body were in his deci- sion not to renew Rose's contract. Mike Winn, when asked about Rose's performance as Student Activities Director, said that he thought \Lee did good things,\ but had no experience dealing with any other environment and had \noth- ing to compare\ Rose's perfor- mance to. He said that Rose \al:lo- cated a great deal of power\ to the stttdents, but noted that some people who \disagreed with the running of the office.\ When con- ta<:ted by Concordiensis, Mike Fergllson '97 refused comment on Rose's tenure and dismissal from the position of Student Activities Director. Brantigan, Rossi, and Marino also all refused comment when asked to comment on Rose's performance. Andy Markowski also refused to speak with Concordiensis regarding Rose's performance. Mike DeMicco, former general manager ofWRUC, the Union College radio station, said that he worked with Rose fre- quently and commented, \When- ever I had to work with Lee, heal- ways did everything to ensure your needs and the station's needs were met.

Campus News Womyn's Union Crew Team Opens New Boathouse \Minerva's Daughters\ continuedfrumpage 1 by Brooke BaryUck Contributing Writer The Union College Womyn's Union and \Minerva's Daugh- ters,\ supported by 1he Women's Studies Program, produced a won- derful program called \Stories of Women Significant in Our Lives,\ acknowledging Women's History Month. Although March is the actual month, these. groups de- cidedto extend the celebration into April to allow the Union College population to attend without the preoccupation of final exams. The program was held in Old Chapel on April yct and 4 111 at 7:30 PM. To add to the atmosphere of recollection and celebration, \Re- membrance A I tars\ were set up around Old Chapel, each prepared very specially by a different orga- nization. Those who took part in the celebration were Thurston House, Womyn'sUnion, Alliance of Latino and Afro-American Stu- dents, Minerva's Daughters and Shakti. The decorations of these altars included interesting art work, items of traditional dress, plants and pil- lows. At the beginning of the per- formance Gail George, the director of Minerva's Daughters, invited the audience to announce the names of the women who had sig- nificant importance to them. The spectators showed obvious reluc- tance at first but the room then became filled with so many names that it was difficult to distinguish one from another. The presentation involved eight women aged 1 7-77 who told, in nar- rative, movement and music, the story of a woman or women who have been significant in their life. This woma1~ was someone she knew personally or, in other cases, a woman from history, their tradi- tion, or family legend. The perfor- mance was an integrated work with some of the stories interweaving with another. Each segment was unique and moving. All actvesses demonstrated much emotion and tenderness when describing the im- portant women in their lives. Two outstanding musicians supported and enhanced these stories. Their music filled the room and added to the drama and beauty of the performances. Judy Fitzner-Atchinson played the pi- ano. She is a composer and accom- panist for dance companies and classes. She is also a member of the Skidmore faculty. Barry Hyman has played classical, band, ami cof- fee house music throughout the United States. He played the gui- tar, piano, and sitar as well as Afri- can and South American instru- ments. The program concluded with an opportunity to share stories with other audience members while en- joying the refreshments that were provided. Itnportant Infortnation for Catnpus~ to Note I.E.F.

Now ~hat we have our own place we can do things more efficiently and that will make our end product a whole lot better,\ said Papanickolas. Things have already been look- ing bright for Union Crew how- ever. Kenley Smith, the second co- captain, recognized the efforts of all members of the team and com- mented on how much they have aU improved. \People have worked so efficiently over this winter that I think they will take that mental Hannah Blum 1 TC toughness that they've gained _ ___;;T..,;.;h.;;.e..;.n;..;;e..;.;w_b;;.... o;;.,.a;..;;t.;.;..h.;..oz;;;.;;is;.;;e __ w.;..l.;..'fl'-'p:;..;r...;;o..;.v.;;.;id.;;;e;..;a;.;.;.m.;.;..pt;;.;l;;;.;;e..;.r..;;o..;;;.o;..;;m.;..,/i~o;.;..r...;;b;..;o;..;.a;;;;.t..;;;.s.;.;;to;.;..r.;;;agQ.e.;.;;. __ and bring it onto the water,\ Smith said. While the teams' races are lim- ited, the training is vigorous for this group. The team practices nearly a full school year for their short season with a hope of an appear- ance at States and Nationals. \You train all fall, winter, and spring, for four regular season races. You do a year's worth of work for 32 minutes on the water,\ Smith stated. Those 32 minutes will be critical forthe Dutchmen however, as they have their best shot ever at mak- ing Nationals. Although winning would mean a lot to the entire 4-5 member crew, the eight seniors have a special attachmer.t to the team. Kenley Smith, Katie Ott, Margaret Sullivan, Aileen Quigley, Jen Brady, Nicho- las Papanickolas, Brian Serrell, and Jason Monnell, have all been through the ups and downs of the program for four years and realize just how far the program has pro- gressed. The boathouse is one .ex.ample ofthat progression. Under the strong leadership of coach White and the assistant coach Shannon Daley the team has been able to focus on a regimented training schedule and the adjust- ment to a Varsity program at Union. \[Daley] has been a very strong presence for the women on the team because before she came we had two male coaches,\ said Smith \Sh.e has been a very effective leader.\ Smith went on to comment on the role and dedication of coach White as well. \Tom pushed so hard for the boat house and overall has really helped to mold the team,\ said Smith.

ORLD by Allison Ciolino, Shana Dangelo, and Kelly Johnson Contributing Writers So where did you go for your Spring Break? Cancun? Florida? Europe? Or maybe you spent the week at home watching Jerry Springer and Days of Our Lives? Well, instead of opting for the usual Spring Break destination, eight students headed to Chicago for an \Urban Plunge\ to spend their vacation volunteering in vari- ous communities ofsouth Chicago. The eight of us, Allie Ciolino, Jen Stratton, Michelle Sanchez, Jessica Chappell, Dart VanSlyke, Kelly Johnson, Shana Dangelo, and Jay \The Claw\ Turi, along with Union College Catholic Chap- lain Tom Frieberg, boarded thevan at 5 AM Saturday morning in a treacherous snowstonn. After a long 14 hour van ride which re- quired about 30 reststops, we fi- nally arrived in the \windy city'~. We found the place where we were staying, .a house owned by Ottr Lady ofGuadalupeparish in South Chicago. After settling in, we went for a quick tour ·Of downtown, fol- lowed by a taste of \the best stuffed pizza in Chicago.\ The next couple of days, we fo- cused our energy on getting to know the diverse culture and prob- lems that afflicted the people ofthe inner city. Our first stop involved a visitto Saint Sabina's, a predomi- nantly African-American Church. There we were immediately ex- posed to a different way of religioltS worship that incLuded a four hottr mass wherepeoplefreely expressed their beliefs by singing, clapping, and dancing. The most profound momentofthe massoccun·ed when we stood amund the altar holding hands with people of all ethnk groups and the priest declared, \This is what heaven looks like.\ The following day, we received a tour ofthe South Chicago steel mills which were once a major fi- nancial contribution to the economy, providing employment for many loca !residents. Presently, these steel mills are no longer op- erational and are thus a major cause .of the pove1ty found in this area.

Forecasters: Five Atlantic Hurricanes in 1998 1977 Alumnus Gains Promotion HOUSTON (Rellters)- The I 998 Atlantic hurricane season is likely to brew up eight tropical storms, five of which will become hurricanes, a weather forecasting group said Friday. Courtesy ofSouthwall Inc. Press Release On March 3'd, Southwall Tech- nologies Inc. anllounced the ap- pointment of Thomas G. Hood, class .of 1977, to the position of President and CEO.

A decision regarding a permanent replacement for the po- sition is expected within six months. Chairman of the Board, J. Larry Smart, commented on the change in management by saying, \Since Tom is a very strong candidate, we have decided to give him an imme- diate interim appointment to the position. The Board agrees that Tom has a record of providing strong leadership within the com- pany, espeoially in the area ofmar- keting sales and business devel- opment. The company will con- tinue to benefit from Tom's leader- ship and we are confident that Tom will actively lead the company's business actiwities to the achieve- ment of its cmrporate goals.\ Hood joi11ed Southwall in July of 1981.

I am C()nfident that we have a great team at Southwall to meet the challenges ahead,\ said Hood. Hood, wh() is 42, holds a Master · ofScience degree in mechanical en- gineering from New Mexico State University, and a Bachelor of Sci- ence degree in mechanical engi- neeringfrom Union. He currently Lives in Portola VaHey, California, with his wife, Judy, and their two · children. The Houston-based Weather Research Center said there was a 45 percent chance that one of the hurricanes would be a major storm with . winds above 114 miles perfuour(180 kph). The group predicted a parti<:ularly active year in the Gulf of Mexico. It said there was a 90 percent chance the West ·coast of Florida would be struck by a storm, up from the usual 60 to 70 percent. Other areas likely to be hi.t included the East coast ()fFlorida, with a 70 percent probability, Mexico also at 70 percent and Texas 60 percent. Jill Hasting, a meteorologist with the group, said a normal Atlantic hurricane season would br[ng nine tropical storms. \We're predicting a near-normalseason, but it will really depend on the effects of El Nino and whether it will continue to suppress storm formation,\ she said. Beijing Police Detain Leading Dissident BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese security police on Friday raided the Beijing home ofleading dissi<lent Xu Wen li, taking him away and carting offh is computer, letters and photographs, Xu's wife said. \More than 10 people came into the house this m()rning and took him away,\ He Xintong said by telephone. \They confiscated our computer, a fax machine, photo.s he took with frie.nds, letters and almost anything with words. \The house is in a C()mplete mess,\ she said.

Over the next eight issues it is the goal of the staff to right some of the past wrongs and change your minds about this paper. 121 years ago the Concordiensis was established to be the voice of the student body; it has lost that journalistic integrity by the fault of no one party. This paper was not designed to be the personal vehicle of a few special interest parties. Tile following is a list of goals, and a pledge to our readers that at least 90% of these goals will be met by the end of the term: -Provide concise articles that detail how issues could affect the students. ~Provide timely articles to the reader. -Discontinue all writers who feel it necessary to car1y out personal vendettas. -Return the talented writers who left this publication, or were forced out by social politics. -Provide a newspaper that welcomes and encourages intelligent submissions. -Keep readers informed of news in tlze local area surrounding the campus. -Start providing front-page stories on our web site. -More feature stories about students and professors. -More photographs and fewer pull quotes. -No longer suppressing information which the student body has a right to know. Tit is paper is called the Concordiensis, which translated means \Union's.\ It is a paper for and about all of the students, the faculty, and the issues that make up this college. We are sorry for the past but cannot change it. We can only ask for another chance, because this term things will get better. OP/ED Pointless Observations by David Kavegrati Opinions Editor My God, I've been finding it so hard to write th.is stuff now that my Attention Deficit Disorder is cured. You can't honestly understand, ln tile past, when I wrote these articles every week., I could just zone out like I usually do in class or when I'm reading and ideas would just come to me like that. Now that my \disorder\ is gone, I seriously don't know how I'm going to keep up writing this article. Plus, if you haven't noticed, there are new Editors-in-Chief this term, and I guess that they have this whole initiative thing where they're trying to somehow dean up the paper. So, I am guessing that it's only a matter of time before they throw me out What do youthink-two, three weeks? Maybe even less-ifyou want to take bets, the line is 2 l/2 weeks plus or minus a week. They says that they want to \discontinue all writers who feel it necessary to carry out personal vendettas.\ What fun is writing if that option isn't available anymore? Why don't we just cancel Christmas too while we're at it? Oh well, maybe I'll try to amuse myself by writing for News or something like that. I can see my end at this paper just like Jesus could see His own death. I guess I'll just have to find some way to enjoy my last few issues while I still can. I don't know how long I am going to la:st. Well, I don't want to bore you, but I lega11y changed my name over break (from David Kay to David Kavegrati .... See the byline). Actu- ally, I didn't change it, but I just changed it back to its original form. Ycm see, my grandfather changed his name during the early 1900's . because Italians were discriminated against wllen looking for jobs. I . never really liked the name, though, and I guess that now I don't have . to worry about it anymore. The only problem is that now I'll have to keep repeating it and spelling it to people who are completely retarded : and don't know how to spell. Wait, now that's an attack on retarded people. Excuse me, Editors. Now that hockey season is over, I don't really have all that much to write about, to tell you the truth. What is there to fill the hollow gut that created so many laughs last term? I guess I could write about all the ; problems that happen here in the newspaper office. First of all, I'd like · to say that things have been a lot smoother this week then they have ' been in the last 20 weeks. We're getting things done a lot faster than ' usual, and it's a lot more efficient. Yes, we can attribute this to our new Editors-in-Chief. However, it's not exactly like things are fun around here- it's always a constant : shouting match and successive arguments. For a minute I thought I was back at home again. Oh, it's horrible- one person leaves the , room, and all they do is jump to start talking behind his back. Then you • wouldn't believe it, but a former Editor-in-Chief quit again .... What's · going to happen next, are we going to keep expanding the Sports section · until it turns into the Union Sporting News? How about a full color pboto of Trevor Koenig on every page instead .of just the last one? Well, at least we can be glad that we have been blessed with a new library. Maybe we can start working on the rest of the school now. I know that we wouldn't want our lawn grass to grow over a quarter of an inch long or anything, but maybe we should start thinking about our overcrowded classrooms and the overabundance of teaching assistants · and research students- wait, sorry. I thought th.at I was accepted at . Binghamton for a minute. Sometimes I lapse like that once in a while. Well, now forthe letters section. I know it's been piling up over spring break ...

I\ 1 thetic.\ Over the past two tenus there have been rumors and worries about changes in the alcohol policy, and the students complained. A year ago, there were rumors that Achilles Rink might be replaced, and once agaill the students complained. A few years back, before most of Hs were here, there was a change in the meal plan that have some alumni still refusing to ma:ke donations. The amount of bickering and Whining that happens due to any pos- sible change that might occ1:lr or has occurred on this campus is pa- thetic.

However, when it is time to work ontl10se policies, it is very rare to find the students who complain at- tending important meetings. It is great to put on a show for one's friends, one's parents 1 or the faculty. It is another thing to make a substantial time commitment to a . cause. Those who wish for gifts to be handed out in life are blind to the past. If you look briefly at the history ofthis nation you will see that our freedoms and liberties were not just handed out. They were earned. Yes, many men and women complained; however, tltey were around to back up their words. This term at Union, similar to many past springs, will be pivotal for the future of this institution. Elections will he held for student forum and for other student;.run committees.

For the past seven months, I've refused to let go and I've been miserable.

The majority of the students here are way too label conscious and nouveau riche.

Doctors believe a combination of drug therapy ~nd behavior therapy is most sue- cessful in treating OCD. Most of the medi- cations are known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRI's. Some of the most popular medications include Prozac, Paxil, Luvox, and Zoloft. Behavior therapy encourages people to recognize their fears without acting out on them in compulsive behaviors. Research has shown that the symptoms decrease in forty to ninety-five percent of treat~d patients. Doctors feel determination is key to re~overy. Many people mistakenly believe that people with OCD should and can simply stop their compulsive behaviors. Most ob- sessive compulsive pe0ple can recognize their behaviors are unnecessary, bat they still can not stop performing them. \With a compulsion, the anxiety rises to unbearable and terrifying levels if the compulsion is not allowed to take place.\ While some people can restrict their compulsive behaviors at school or work, after months or years of fighting OCD, resistance often diminishes and the disorder can rule a .perso11's life and become more difficult to reverse in the fu- . ture. Only ten to twenty percent of people with OCD recover without therapy. People who feel they have some of the symptoms of an obsessive cor:npulsive dis- order should asktheirdoctorto recommend a psychiatrist or psychologist experienced in diagnosing OCD to discuss their symp- toms.

She grew 11p in Maine but now resides in Philadelphia, worlting two jobs to support an apartment.

We smother ourselves with the trials and tribu- lations of folks we will never meet - all to block out the doubt that echoes through our own heads.

After you meet them you say, \Whatsup\ for a few days, tl1en eventually if you see them com- ing, you might mumble something quietly that sounds like \hello\ or you do anything possible not to make eye contact. This is because people pretend not to know you a lot, since, \I was really drunk last night\ is followed by ''I'm sorry I don't remember you.\ The eye contact thing is a prob- lem. You see a person you don't want to say hello to, so all of a sud~ den the Alumni Gym looks like a pretty interesting thing to stare at. .. or, wait a minute and ch~ck out those extremely interesting cracks in the sidewalk. I also like the straight ahead stare, that dis- plays power.

Good friendsarethe least of my worries. When they ask, \Howzit go un\ they actually care.

That can backfire though; because ev- eryone has people that know their names, hut don't know the other person's name. Parties seem to obliterate my theory by 98%. Everybody, in their own state of merry bliss, seems to act a lot friendlier. In- toxication helps you catch upwith people that you've grown apart from. Or it can break the ice be- tween people that hate each other. You can say whatever you want to somebody and, at the moment, not have to worry about tbe reper- cussions.

My question of the week is, do people actually expect a response to, \Whatsup\, \Howzit go un\ \Howe R Ya\or \Howwuz yer break\. l prefer to just pretend that the word \hi'' has been said to me, instead of one of these commonly uttered phrases. Yet, there are some people who take offense when you don't take time to an- swer Jheir unique questions.

QJ:uncorbiensis • April ~' 1()~8 · Page 13 Jon Tapper's Weekly Commeatary by Jon Tapper Staff Writer I want to call this edition ofmy column, \How I spent my Spring Break.\ Spring Break was awesome. I didn't actually go anywhere. But I still had a great time. To the average person who spent the break in Hawaii or 'f.lorida or somewhere else in a warm climate, this might seem like a \noth- ing special\ sort of spring break. But to me, it couldn't be beat. So let me tell you all about it. First ·of all, I went home. Home to me is the hub that is Danvers, Massachusetts. I spent my first weekend home hanging out with my friends from high school and do- ing good stuff like that. Yes, this was fun, butnot the stuffthat good columns like the one you expect from me are made of. So on with the week. The beginning of the week (Monday- Wednesday during the day), was also kind of slow. I saw some people from work and I saw three movies. Two were really good (As Good As It Gets and Good Will Hunt- ing) and one was really bad (Mr. Nice Guy). But my column is not a movie review, so I will spare you the Siskel and Ebert act of reviewing these movies. Wednesday night, things began to get a little bit, shall we say, out of the ordinary. A group made up of a.~ouple of my friends from right here at Union College; and my parents went to a dive of a pub to see a hand made up of my parents' friends. The band' was really good (except for the lead singer). But we got really good ribs and had a good time. Thursday was the day in which all days should be judged by. We started out at all a small little bagel. place in Danvers. Then we proceeded into Boston to see the much- publicized WrestleManiaXIV Public Work- out.• For all of you, who are familiar with Boston, this was held at City Hall Plaza in front of an !!Stimated crowd of 10,000 in- toxicated lunatics at 12 noon. officers in full riot gear to put down the Rodney King riots witllout: breaking a sweat. WWF owner Vince McMahon was there, so was WWF Commissio11er Sgt. Slaugh- ter. \Superstars\ in attendance included: Shawn Michaels, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Chyna, The Headbangers, and Stone Cold Steve Austin. But the man (and 'I d() use this term loosely) that everyone was there to see was \Iron\ Mike Tyson. The self proclaimed \Saddest Man on the Flanef\ or as one spec- tator noted \The Bctddest Man on the Pwanet\. Anyway, lle was there looking like the total screwup that be i:,. He often looked like he had n() idea V~hat he was do- ing and what was going on. Also, the name of the man who he was supposed to hate was Stone Cold Steve Austin, not Cold Stone Steve Austin. Basically, Mike Tyson is an idiot who nolollg.erhlts.any dignity or self-respect. He w:illdoanyth ing for a buck. After this fine \spectacle\ was over, we proceeded to the New Eng;htnd Aquarium where we saw Sea Lio11s a.nd Penguins, ~mongother fish. It was a blast. Then we went to the Hard Roell. Cafe in Boston. I wanted to go to Hooters, bat I got outvoted, oh well. The Hard R:ock was fun anyway. And we capped of a very fast-paced and expensive dayfnig;ht at fhe Fleetcenter to watch the Boston Brttim• down the Phila- delphia Flyers. Overall, a truly random day.

IIB,.8 The Man in the Iron Mask Starring: Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerald Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne, Anne Parillaud, and Leonardo DiCaprio. \When rioting citizens of France destroyed the BastiJ:le, they dis- covered within Hs records this mysterious entry: 'Prisoner num- ber 64389000, the man in the iron mask.' His identity has forever re- mained a mystery.\ Thus begins the newest, but not as popular as Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio movie. In this final installment of Alexandre Dumas' Three Muske- teers Trilogy, it has been years since Aramis, Athos, Porthos and D'Artagnan fought side by side as the bravest and best ofth~ King's Royal Guards with legendary pas- sion and valor. Aramis (Jeremy Irons) has since hung up his SWC)rd in favor of the - ·..;.·· cloth. Athos .(John Malkovich) devoted b.is life to raising his be- loved son Raoul while Porthos (Gerald Depatdieu) has grown port- lier than ever, but nonetheless re- mains the party animal of the group~ Only D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) remains active as the loyal captai11ofthe King's Royal Guards. Yet, not all is well in France. It is 1660 and King Louis XIII, whose throne the Musketeers protected, has been dead for eight years, and was succeeded by his cruel son Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio). The country is being run into the groun<l as Louis believes that France is his personal playground. The peasants are starving. The country is engaged in a costly war. All the while, the king uses his crown and lavish palace to get women into bed. In an attempt to save the coun- try, Aramis, Athos, and Porthos undertake a risky plan to switch King Louis with his twin brother, \Man in the Iron Mask was released on the heels of the Titanic, as it was at- tempting to cash in on the success of Leonardo DiCaprio.\ Philippe, who has been imprisoned in an iron mask. However, D'Artagnan has an undy,ing loy- alty to the king, even if it means watching his king ruin the coun- try. This puts the \All For One, One for All\ motto in peril. The Man in the Iron Mask is a surprisingly good movie;, and a lot better th~ what we had thought it was going to be when we bought the tiekets. One of the th~ngsthat the movie has going for itis its all~ star cast. Jeremy Irons has starred in Die Hard: With A Vengeance, Stealing Beauty, M. Butterfly and The Lion King (voice of Scar). His portrayal of Aramis is simi.Jar to his role in The Mission, in which he played the Jesuit priest Gabriel. This is also the first movie we have seen where John Malkovich plays a good guy. Some of his memorable 'bad guy' characters are in Con Air and In the Line of Fire. ''In The Man in the lron Mask, he is still remotely evil even as a good guy. I kept picturing him in In the Line of Fire trying to kill the president.\ -Michael Korcynski. Even Leonardo \Mr. I'm too good for theOscars\ DiCaprio did an incredible job playing both Louis and Philippe. DiCaprio is able to get in toucl! with his dark side when he isLouis. The role (}f Philippe, however, falls short. ·As .one would think, spending eight yeats imprisoned in an iron mask would make any- one at least a tiny bit mental. Man In the Iron Mask was re- leased on the heals of Titanic, as it was attempting to cash in on the success of DiCaprio's role as Jack Dawson. It actually tied Titanic for box office.sales for its first week, hut then feU from the top. All in aU, this is a goodaction/adventure and drama .. One of the problems with the movie is that it lacks good dia- logue, and it starts off very slow, focusing on how the young Louis is a cruel king who is more ob- sessed with chasing skirts than worrying abo11t an unjust war and starving .peasants. \¥hen the plan to replace the king surfaces, how- ever, the momentum of the film picks up andspeeds toward the ex- citing confrontation of the identi- cal twins.

Arts & Entertainment OO:ancnrbiensis; • April 9, 1998 • Page 17 Full Montelles Perform for Opening of Coffeehouse Writer Mike Winn Critiques Theatre's Fortunettes in ''State of the Art'' by Kimberly Rohback A&E Editor Last Tuesday at 8:30 PM, the Full Montelles performed for the opening of Coffeehouse this tenn. The band, composed of: Arya Chowdhury {guitar, vocals, flute) a.k.a. Colonel Sanders, Heath Fradkoff(bass, vocals) a.k.a. Baron Von Heathen scum, Kaleb Sturges {drums) a.k.a. the Dime-bag Stur.gen, Dave Bernet (saxophone, vocals) a.k.a. Mt. Dave, and Nick Crawford (trumpet) a.k.a. NC 17, describe themselves as the '\ulti- mate Fontanelles tribute band.\ You may remember the Fontane- lles from such popular events as Earth Day 1997,or last year's Cof- feehouse. Well; they're back. They have a new name, which remains consis- tent with the band's policy ofkeep- ing the end of their name with \- elles.\ (Last term they were the Purple Pimpernelles.) When asked to comment on the band's new name, Fradkoff explained that \Full Montelles\ is actually a plethora of entendres. The band chose the name par- tially because of the recent Acad- emy Award nominated film, The Full Monty, partially because of the infamous talk-show host Monte! Williams (author ofthe much ac• claimed autobiography, \Moun- tain Get Out of My Way\) and because oftheir\elles\ policy. The audience was thrilled. The Full Montelles combined their mu- sical talents with a great sense of humor to put on a spectacular show. \I'm really excited because the band has changed so much. They have a new sound, a new image, and it's greatto see a band so enthused ab0ut playing for the campus community\ said Lori Greene my fantabulous co-editor of the greatest .section in this pa- per, and the Chet's Booking Direc• tor. \With all due respect, they sucked\ said our new horrifically critical staff writer Mike Winn. He sees no joy or beauty in any art and perhaps if we get enough of a response from our millions.ofread- ers, we will frre his sorry a-s. Please send all hate mail about Mike Winn to the ConcordiensisOffice. (Just kidding.) \It's great to see new acts at the Coffeehouse, that's the whole reason it's there!\ said Society President Gina LaSorsa.\ \I haven't seen a band play such good music and entertain a crowd in such a long time\ quothe the Matt Aronowitz. Although the band throughout its various stages has been seen all over campus, last Tuesday marked the premier of their new members and style. Everyone is reminded that Coffeehouse is open every Tuesday night and is constantly looking for new faces to grace the stage, if you have an act or any suggestions, please feel .free to caHDoug @x-5820. Everyone is also reminded that ANYONE can beamemberofCof- feehouse, just let Doug know! Hooray for the Full Montelles! Great Job! A&E loves you! byMikeWinn Staff Writer For the last year and a half, I .have had achance to participate in several theater productions on campus, ranging from large scale department productions to Moun- tebanks nigbt of scenesto musical revues, and I'm not going to leave ()Ut the infamous Cabarets. I've bad the time of my life being a part of theater at Union, and realize the importance ofit in tile scope of my education here. Throughout my theatre ca- reer .here, there has been something missing though, and that is the process of im- provement· to critique. With all due respect to the two wonderful women who run A&E, I have found the re- views of student productions t() be over friendly. They are reluctant to point <Jut the weaknesses of the actors and actresses, as well the produc- tion as a whole. Now don't get me wrong, I think that just stepping <Jn to a stage deserves some ap- plause. I've also noticed that while oc- casionally an actor may have some weaknesses in a show, they always seem to have strengths as well, and both should be pointed out. A .healthy critique will only help an actor or director grow out of the weaknesses by making him/her aware of it. So ~h out further ado, l present to you Union's newest A&E col- umn, STATE OF THE ART, a mix- tare of critical review, bad jokes, and poor writing. A column that wiH be supportive of theatre at Union, but at the same time have the gall to criticize even the most talented of Union's actors and ac- tresses. Although there have been no student productions as of yet this term, Yulman Theater hosted Proct-er's Too last Friday and Sat- urday night. This term's Proctor's Too pro- ducthon was The Fortunettes, a unique musical comedy put to- gether by the production company Pink Inc. The show told the story of three housewives who are res- cued from their posts in the kitchen by winning a. beauty make-over. With scientific marvel, a hefty amount of plastic (hair) and one stage mishap of a collapsing chair, the women are transformed into bee-bopping, hip-hopping, tacky clothes wearing, pointy busted Mot()wn stars. Thoe story is told almost fully thrDllgh the lip synching of clas- sic Motown oldies, and the chore- ography with the music was very good. The three women called The Forttrnettes, tour the world with their show, on their way to star- dom. The Fortunettes did a phenom- LOCAL ARTs· CALENDAR April 5t1t ...

The three women were joined with an actor whose roles in the show varied from their manager to a crazy scientist. Kudos to his performance and the unparalleled energy he pos- sessed on stage. To an audience member, the story was weak though. The girls' flashy presenta- tions for each song began to become quite redundant. I personally became tired of the show halfway through it, and was reduced to laugh at the stupidity of what was taking place on the stage. The girls just simply ran out material, like anyone would after twenty songs. So as an overall assessment of the show, I must say that all of the actors and actresses did a great job, and never ran out of energy. Unfortunately the show did run out of energy and pounded the audience member into the tar pit of boredom. The fact that there was an $8 charge to see this little fiasco hurts me, and I will seek reimbursement from the Concordiensis. Person- ally, ifYulman is going to bring in only one Proctor's Too production a term, I'd like to see something a bit better . Something without a 15 minute interlude of boring slides and bad music. Reports from backstage point out the chaos going on and the entertainment of such, and l would be bold enough to say that it was probably more entertaining than what I saw on stage.

Union and Skidmore were very evenly matched teams, as both were able to maintain a close- ~coring game. But Union's young offense was too strong for Skidmore, as freshmen attack-men Dutcher registered five goals, as did Nick Balascio, who put two in the net. Other players scoring for Union were juniors Benson and Chad Schneider. The defense consisting of senior Jason and Mike Guild and Matt Schifano played exceptionally well, shutting down the well- known powerful Skidmore offense. Dutcher, who currently leads the team in points, felt that the Skidmore game was a good turn- around from their previous game against Hartwick. \It was nice to see our own team come together. We played good team offense and defense, which made us come out on top. Ifwe continuetoplaywell, we will have a very successful sea- son,\ Dutcher said. Although Coach McCormack was upset with the Hartwick re- sults, he stated that he was pleased with his team's play against Skidmore. \Our game against Hartwick was somewhat frustrat- ing.

ULTIMATE UNION By Siraj Bhadsavle Contributing Writer Although the sport has yet to sweep Union by storm, this past weekend marked a significant step in the development of a solid Ultimate program at Union. For those that are unfamiliar with Ultimate, the game combines the flow of soccer, a football-like field with endzones and some of the passing and moving elements of basketball and adds a new spin to these sports by incorporating the Frisbee. Ultimate has been around for thirty years and has been very popular throughout the world in both the intercollegiate and club levels. Union's Ultimate Club, started this year by sophomores Mike lger, Sean Spindler-Ranta and Ed Lallier, is years behind many other colleges. For example, Dartmouth has had an Ultimate club for over fifteen years and Princeton has had one for 26 years. However, Continued on page 21

I S orts Union Rugby Shuts Down Siena by Peter Mody Spurts Writer \ The Union College Men's Rugby team began its drive for the Upstate Champion- ships with a 1 0-0win over the Siena Brawlin; Groundhogs on Saturday. Union featured a redesigned pack and line from the fall sea- son. Standout forwards from last season in- cluded senior captain Mark \Pour Some of that Sugar on Me\ D 'Am bruoso, props B iH \The Mad Man\ Servant and Mat \The Iron Lung\ Scheller, and second row Stephen \Ground Pound'' Flaherty (who .played an earlier game with the New York State All- Stars). Joining them were some heavy hit- ting veterans who were on terms abroad last season. Travis \This Ain't Ballet\ Clark (Greece), Pike \FistsofFury\ Mody (China), and Dan \'The Navigator\ Rickson (Amsterdam), all helped add experience and precise executian of Siena ruggers to the young and newly grizzled forwards from last season. The line went through a complete over- haul as well. Senior Captain Brian \Malibu\ Field moved into the scrumhalf position to replace the concert attending sophomore Heath \'Ph ish is Life\ Levine. Junior Presi- dent Fred \Chill for a Smoother Taste\ Gibney assumed the role offly-half, while Nick\ This Space For Rent\ Campbell and Atom Nemo Bolin-Gamsby (yes, that is his real name) began their second seasons as inside center and wing, respectively. Round- ing out the line were two freshman ruggers who had never played the game before. Starting at wing was AI\'White Lightning\ Hebert and at fi.dlback was Jon \Sir when you say no rings, do you mean tongue rings?\ Tower. Both had speed and agility which allowed tJ1em to be assets to a fairly young, but determined, Union line. Play began with a Siena kickoff which Union picked up deep in their territory and eventually kicked back down into Siena's half of the field. For the next forty minutes, both teams had moments of near success and defense break down. Neither team was able to capitalize on any oftheir opportuni- ties to score. Union managed an amazing goal line stand, and repelled Siena for around five full minutes well into them iddle of the first half While Siena seemed to con- trol rucks and mauls, it was evident that Union was more brutal with their tackles, allowing neither serum nor line players to have any long runs. The fact that Siena had already played three games showed greatly in their lines ability to run misdirec- tion and overloaded plays. If it wasn't for Union's ability to maintain field position and make critical tackles(by both pack and line), Siena could have jumped to an insurmount- able lead. Aftera hard fought first half, the score remained tied at 0-0. The beginning of the second half began much like the first had left off. Both teams fought hard against each other, and al- though they could move the ball well, nei- ther team could push in for a score. Siena did, however, begin to tire, and it showed in the rise of penalties and \min or superlative outbursts\ that came from their players, both verbally and physically. It was this type of play that caused Union forwards; Clark and Crazy George, shoulder injuries and forced them to leave the game. What pushed Siena even further into des- peration was Union putting points on the board. About 12 minutes into the second half, Siena was penalized for a high tackle and the ensuing kick by Field finally put Union uptoa3-0 lead. After more loose play, Field capitalized on another Siena error. After tying up sev- eral of Siena's backs, a misthrown pass bounced on the ground and Field booted it into Siena's try zone, He outran both Siena's fullback and wing, faHing on the ball to score the only tty of the day. After netting the PAT, Union held a IG-0 lead over the Fightin Groundhogs. It was more than they would need. Siena did, however, twice threaten to score very late in the game. With two min- utes left, at the Union 3 meter line, Siena had a lineo:ut and needed to push the Union pack backwards only 9 feet to score. After a steal by Flaherty, the ball dropped at the Union 1, Mody fell on it, causing two Siena players to trip over him and drawing a penalty. Moments later, after a deep kick into Siena territory by Field; Siena's inside center pop kicked the ball over Union's head and raced to attempt to beat Tower for the ball. Tower picked up the ball and attempted to shed his oncoming tackler and kick the ball down field. As he dropped the ball to kick it, the Siena player grabbed him by the shirt collar and pulled him to the ground. This drew the final penalty of the game. With the high tackle penalty allowing another Field kick, the ball sailed deep to the Siena fullback .. He :tried to break both right and left, but the oncoming flood ofUnion garnet eventually stopped him for a small gain, and caused him to fumble, stopping play as time expired. It was a hard fought victory for an up and coming team. Captain Mark D'Ambruoso said \We need to work on our rucking and mauliAg a lot. I was impressed with our over all play and aggressiveness, but we have a lot of work to do before the Beast of the East Tournament in two weeks.\ On the B side of things, Union<started a tremendous amount of talent without mucb in terms of experience. Siena jumped out to an early 10-0 lead, but then fell into the same drought that their A side had found earlier in the day. Although experience was not on hand, Siena found that Union brought a host of people who loved to do one thing: TACKLE. Freshmen Mike \'Physique\ Pingpank, Dave \Bull\ Dozer, Bill \I Like This Rugby Stuff' Dozersfriend, and Crew defector and spring term senior rookie Andrew \Hawkeye\ Mallios made Siena ruggers pay for running in their direction. Forwards Chris \My Lungs, They Hurt\ Vietor and Seth \Shear Energy\ Potkin an- chored the serum, which began to dominate in the second half. The tide of the game began to swing in the Union's direction, as Pete \Downhill = Good\ Casola pounded (or maybe thundered in) in for an apparent try. The ref called it back and Union still trailed 10-0. Soon afterwards, Frank \The Rocket\ Federici, broke threw the line and scored the Killer B's only try of the game. Although they lost 10-5. Union's B's con- trolled the game from the beginning ofthe second half. If the game had been the usual 80 minutes in length, instead of 40, it is very possible that the B side would have pre- vailed. It was an excellent job the whole way aro~nd. The two best plays ofthe day were netted by B-siders. The runner up was Marius, who after chasing the ball way out of the back of the try zone, dove onto a con- crete sidewalk to ensure that no Siena play- ers would come near it, lacerating his knee and giving most of us great amusement. The number one play was from Mayher. The-turkish-kid-in-the-pink-shorts, who was carrying the ball and was absolutely crushed by a Siena prop. After the game he said '\No matter how hard I get hit, I will still · hurt in the morning.\ Although I didn't re- ally understand what he meant, I never do, so that was no big deal. The team's next games come in a travel tourney hosted in two weeks in Providence, RI. <Unn.corttiett51Jil1i • A ril 9, 1998 • Pa e 19 Softball 0££ To Promising Start by David Brooks Sports Writer As most of the Union student body was enjoying its one-week spring break, the Union College Softball team he11ded to Fort Meyers, Florida, for a week of non-stop soft- ball.

Page 20 • April9, 1998 • C!lnucnrhlen~i~ · Sports Sanabia Torches Competition In Track Opener Wins two events and blazes through 400m on relay clocking a 49.97 split by Jason Everett Sports Writer The Union men's and women's track teams opened their 199 8 out- door track season this past Satur- day in dual meet action against Hamilton CoHege here at Union. Competing in cold and windy con- ditions resulted in numerous slow performances for both the men and the women's squads. Despite the harsh conditions, one Union athlete seemed imper- vious to the gusty winds and nail biting cold. Freshman Dennis Sanabia opened the outdoor sea- son right where he left off in states which were held 500 feet away in the field house back in February where he had a third place finish. Sanabiablazed through the lOOm and 200m in 11.13 and 22.56 sec- onds respectively. As much as Sanabia beat the competition in the lOOm, . 94 seconds, Sanabia topped that in the 200m where he won by close to 1.5 seconds, which is an eternity in sprinting. As impres- sive as this performance was, on the men's 4x 400 relay, Sanabia ran third leg and those who may have had any doubts as to Sanabia's fit- ness, were left shaking their heads. Sanabia received the baton from sophomore Kenny Scott and de- spite a wicked headwind on the backstretch, Sana:bia ran tough and was clocked with, :a 49.97 split upon handing off to junior Peter Flynn. This is an incredibly fast time and could be even faster in more comfortable· racing condi- tions.

Sports OOottcnr.bie:tt~is • April 9, 1998 • Page 21 Hard Work Has Sarah·Cardullo Ultimate Union Back Into Athletics at Union Continuedjrompage 18 By Shannon Powers Sports Information Writer SCHENECTADY, N .Y .-Sarah Cardullo' s world came crashing dewn last .spring when a shallow fly ball hit into right-centerfield caused a violent col:Jision that not only ended her freshman softball season at Union College, but came very close to ending a promising athletic career. Now, less than a year later, Cardullo has fought her way back and is vying to regain her starting position in centerfield. A graduate of Seton Catholic Central High School, Cardullo was a four-year member of the soccer and softball teams there. As a member of the softba:ll team, she helped Seton win the state title every year ofherhigh school ca- reer. In her senior year she re- ceived AU-State honors in soccer. CarduHo, who has been involved in athletics since the age of five, chose Union College because, \It offered a good balance between athletics and academics.\ Cardullo started her college ca- reer off right byhelping the soccer team achieve one of its best records in history. As a starter for the team, she ended the year in a tie for the Dutch women's scoring crown with 13 points (on five goals and three assists). \Sarah had a great freshman season and I was looking for her to have as much an impact on the softball team as she did for the soc- cer squad,\ said Brian Spec~, head coach of both soccer and softball. \The soccer season displayed her tremendous speed, skills and scor- ing ability.\ Following the success of the soccer season, Cardullo worked hard during the winter term and came into her first February soft- ball preseaon in great shape. She was determined to win a starting position in the outfield and Speck was looking at her as the team's l-eadoff hitter. \Sarah is both aswitch hitter and a fine bunter,\ Speck explained. \I felt her speed would give us a lot of options atthe top of the order.\ Then, the unthinkable hap- pened. \I was playing centerfield,\ Cardullo recalled. \A ball was hit to right-center and there was a little miscommunication. A teammate and I collided and I went down. I bave no recollection from the time we hit until Cheryl (Union head trainer Cheryl Rockwood) came onto the field. When I finally real,. ized what was going on, 1 knew something was wrong. I had been injured before so I knew this was more than just a sprain.\ Shortly after the incident, Sarah found herself in the car with her mother, who had come to watch her play, on their way to the local hos- pital. \We were both pretty ner- vous,\ she recalls. \My mom told me jokes to try to get my mind off what had just happened to me.\ Cardullo was devastated to learn that her knee injury required exten- sive, and a possible career-ending, surgery. Her initial reaction was to forego the operation. However, be- cause ofher strong will and intense love for her sports, Sarah Cardullo refused to give up. She began treatment to regain strength in her right knee as soon as possible. Although the pain was almost unbearable, she found the strength and commitment to con- tinue herrehabilitation thr()ughout the summer. \At frrst.itwas one of the toughest things I've ever had to do,\ she said. \But after a couple of months, it began to get. easier.\ Upon returning to Union in the fall, CarduHo continued her daily workouts with the College's ath- letic training staff. While the knee had improved, the reco\lery was . not enough to allow her to play soccer last fall. \Having. to watch (soccer) from the side! ines was very diffic1.1lt for me,\ slle recalls, \But it also drove me to work harder at rehabilitating the knee.\ Throughout her recovery Cardullo received a lot ()f support from teammates, coaches and peers. It was her parents' support, however, that kept her going and pulled her through. \ihey were really supportive,\ said Sarah. \They know how important sports are to me and they helped me and pushed me so that I was able to come back from this injury. \It was hard being so dependent on :ethers,\ she continued. \Simple things like carrying rny tray in the dining hall became impossible. I was lucky to have so much sup- port.\ Unwilling to let tile injury side- line her emotiona:Uy, Cardullo stayed close to the .soccer team by volunteering to keep the score book at home and away games. Already a solid student, she put even more ofner energies into her class work. \I had missed som~ classes be- cause of the injury, but with a little extra effort I was able to keep up my grades,\ she explained. A psy- chology major with a minor in En- glish, CardulJ.o plans to attend graduate school after leaving Uni<m in pursuit ofaPh.D. in psy- chology. Fornow,however, she is looking forward to tlte upcomiNg softball season. \It's greatto be back on the field ofplay,\she says. \llaving to deal with something that was beyond my control put a lot into perspec- tive for me. There were days when I felt as though I ilad gone two steps backwards, but I knew that I had to get back into the next day; I just had to keep going. I learned • that no matter what happens, you can't Jet things get you down.\ Speck is also glad to have her back and feels that Sarah's hard . W()rk and dedicati()n to her reba- ' bilitation will bendit her athleti- cally~ academically aad throughout the rest of her life. \When somethin;g that you love is suddenly taken away, it drives you,\ Speck explained. \Sarah has worked very hard t() get back to the sports she loves.. She is much stronger than she Vias before the injury, emotionally and physically. In fact, she is almost a full minute faster in the mile tltan she was a year ago. Sarah's ordeal and the work that she put into her comeback can do nothing but serve as an inspiration for all of us.\ Saturday's second place finish in the college division at the Retired to Stud Tournament 3 at Doylestown, P A (outside . Philadelphia) offers proof that Union is very capable in this sport. Playing against teams with more than double the number of players on the Union roster, the nine-man squad played 3 lengthy matches with few substitutions to beat Drew College ( 13-5), Eastern College ( 13- 6) and perform sol idly against Dartmouth in an 8-13loss. Union's 8 points were the most that any team put up against the Dartmouth team in the tournament. The new spring team- which is captained by Iger and includes Spindler-Ranta, Lallier, Brian Goldberg, Aaron Braunstein, Adam Angle, Dave 'Northup, and Siraj Bhadsavle-hadforrned only four days prior to the tournament. ln Ultimate, it is very unusual for a new team to score many points let alone win a majority of its matches. \I was very impressed with the team,\ captain Iger said. \Overall we achieved more than anybody could have predicted. I see bright things for us in the future.\ The tournament benefited PADA, a Philadelphia-based char- ity, helping those afflicted witlt AIDSJHIV.

The New- York Yankees by C!tristopher Leone Etlitor-in-Chief Let's play b;rm Maybe baseba.H is not what it used to be and half of this c;ountry could care less that the season ope11ed last week. However, since I am a p;urist, last week marked the official beginnillg of spring. Forget March 20th, spring s1Clrted when the first pitch was thrown out on ihe 31st. From nowuntil the beginning of October, baseball fans wm argue who is going to win each division a..11<i who is going to have clas- sic seasons. v./il'l Roger Maris 1961 home run record fa11? Can George Steinbrenner buy another W:&rld Series? Are the Atlanta Braves to be <:ompareq to the Buffalo BiUs? And will a team finish with an ERA above 5.00? The answers to the questions that fans will umlo-u btedly ask are all yes. Last seas()n Mark McGwire crushed 58 homers whil~ K.en Griffey Jr. went deep 55 times. This se-ason both ofthe stars will top Roger Maris rc;cord of61 homers with ease. McGwire rni~ht have broken the mark last year if not for the midseason trade and this season he w,ill play more games in Coors Field. An e~tra 24 pitchers in the maj.or leagues due to this years expansion will aid the players cb;Jse for their respective leagues MVP trophies. If the Y~tllkee pitching holds, George Steinbrenner should be holding his second trophy in tllrti:Je years. The 199& .Yankees have a $72 rn illion pay roll, and the best of- fensive prod11ction in the game. Eight of the teams regul~r starters have hit 20 homers in a season, and the top five- Knoblauch.,. Jet-erl O'Neil, Williams, and Martinez- have hit over .300 im il season. The only problem East Central West WildCard, with this team IS arms w stay healthy. Bet on it, and in case they don't, hope in the fast progression of Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban defector who looked great last week in a simulated game. The Atlanta Bra:ves are the Major League baseball equivalent to the Buffalo Bills. Al- ways in the playoffs, rarely victorious in the big game. One title does not cut it for an organization with this much talent. This year the Braves, despite a Cy Young for Greg Maddux, do not make the World Series and watch the Los Angeles Dodgers pull everyu thing together before loosing to the Yankee's in seven games. Right behind the Braves will be the New Y ark Mets. No, this team can not score runs without Todd Hundley. However, the team Better than ever? This year's NCAA tournament brought the usual hype, but few people believed the winner W()U ld be any team outside of Duke, North Carolina, Kansas, or Arizona. As usual, the tourna.Ille:nt was fu 1l of surprises and when Kansas fell 80-75 in the second round to Rhode Islarncl, a collective cry was heard around the country, as millions of people were eliminatedfr.om their office pools. More importantly, people began realizing that it was anybody's tournament to win and that there was no one team a cut above the rest. This years tourn~ment was marked by buzzer beaters and at times, miracles. Who can forget agreat enan ing. IfBobby Valentine can once again wGrk his bench magic, the Mets beat out the San F:rancisco Giants and Houston Astros. The American League playoff situation is easier to predict and much more fun beca.use the B<>-ston Red Sox are going back to the playoffs. Boston is not that good but the Baltimore Orioles have one regular player under 30 and Cal Ripken needs a vacation, or retirement. The Toronto Blue Jays are a year or two away, and Boston deserves to make it before they loose Mo Vaughn. Pedro Martinez will also return the Cy Young to Beantown. Sorry Roger. The Cleveland Indians at:e a good hitting; team with no pitching. They win the central division by default because the White So-x, · Tigers, Royals and Twins are miserable. Cleveland will make it no further than the first r()und if they have to face the Yankees. Ana:heim is the fmal playoff team and Gnce again it is because of allother teams short comings. The Seattle Mariners are a great hitting team, with the bullpen from hell. Manager Lou Panella will probably have heart failure unless he finds some relief pitching that can hold a lead. Their inept front office will probably trade Randy Johnson, and Griffey will have to wait a couple ofmore years .. We 11 that's about everything and now that we're playing ball let as follow the great words ofEmie Banks. \Let's play two!\ * *' * * * I can not determine if the New England Patriots or the New York Jets are in worse shape for the next century. A great argu- ment can be made for both teams. The Jets may have changed their uniforms this off season but the bone head front of- fice decisions continue. With the team pay- ing a fortune to Neil O'Donnell, Bill Parcells and company had to go out and take a 36 million dollar risk with Curtis Martin, who is often injured. Last Wednesday, Martin in- fonned the media that he plans to take his option and leave the Jets, with his 4 million bonus, after one year. Meanwhile the Jets lost a :first round pick. The Patriots have six:, two from the Jets, of tile first 80 picks in the upcoming draft. The teams main problem is the lack of a run- ning back or full back. It will be hard for Drew Bledsoe to move the ball this season if the teams can key in on the pass. The num- ber of draft picks would appear to solve this problem. However, Pete Carrol has never been known for his brilliant draft analysis. Only time will tell. hit a shot in the lane to give Kentucky its first lea<! of the game. They went on to win the game ,78-69 and give Kentucky its second national championship in three years. With another champion crowned, 63 teams were sent borne with thoug;hts of what could have been, coaches jobs were put in jeopardy, and players graduated with unfulfilled careers. However, for the opportunity to play in the NCAA tournament and feel what the Kentucky players felt when the final horn sounded those involved can only be thankful that they were a part of something special and shared an experience, which others can only dream of.

Although Bibby has yet to comment, his father said, Bibby is ready and over Stanford.

The planned entertainment includes games, such as a keg toss will conclude on Sunday in Cen- tral Park. There is a walk-a-thon to support Muscular Sclerosis at 12PM.

Union's emphasis on the humanities and social sciences, while innovative a decade earlier, was now comparatively common- place; moreover, accrediting boards no longer believed that the simply fact of acceleration justified a joint degree program. If we were to continue the productive joint- degree programs that we had sus- tained over the past two decades, we needed to rethink the program's mission. As luck would have it, I hap- pened to be chairing the College's Health Professions Programs Re- view Committee - HPPRC, or the HiPPoCRates Committee- at the time when Dean Linda Cool, Vice President for Academic Affairs, asked the Committee to respond to AMC's request that we reassess the seven-year joint degree pro- gram.

This would be done for the purpose of helping to \trans- form Union into a more closely knit community by encouraging mem- bers of the community to carry on these discussions after the dia- logues have ended.\ The evening's discussion was facilitated by Toni Blackwell and Chrys Ingraham of Russell Sage College, who are the co-directors of the Allies Center for the Stud) of Difference and Contlict.

~ ~age 4 • April 16, 1998 • C!Iilntnr~usis -C~mpus· News· Feminist Ehrenreich Speaks Out by Anjali Balasingham Staff Writer On Monday, April6, the Lewis Stern lee~ ture was presented by Barbara Ehrenreich, a well-published feminist radical. SponsQred in remembrance ofthe humanist Lewis Stem byhisfamily, the lecture series propos.es to address social issues and themes of rel- evance to all. Accordingly, Ehrenreich's talk did not limit itself to the concept .of femi'* nism, and instead rehited the ideology to various political, economic, and sociologi- cal .patterns. ''I am a feminist;\ Ehrenreich began by stating. Qualifying this remwk,.she explained her goal to expese the \various misconcep- tions\ about the word .. The feminist move- ment has l>een \accuse<Lof many things,\ the most significant ofwhich, according to Ehrenreich\' is destroying the family. \We never tried .to des.troy the family. We just thought that it was such a good idea that mea might want to get involved too.\ Ehrenreich proceeded to devote the rest of her lectu.re to her theories aboutthe mis- interpretati(ms of and the real reasons be- hind the deterioration of the stereotypical American family, Which is characterized by a male breadwinner legally married to a female homemakerand children who live athome. \For over two decades, the breakdown of the family has dominated American politics,\ she said. Contributing to this perpetual pre- occupation are the sobering statistics that now \halfof marriages in the nation end in divorce, 24% of families are headed by single mothers, and 34% of births are out of wed- lock.\ In explaining the sociO'iogical rationale for these figures, Ehrenreich pointed to several factors. \One reas(:)n for the increase in the divorce rate is that w 0 men are now more independent,\ she said. \But the other rea- son is that men llave changed in the last twenty years as well. They're less interested and less capable ofbeingthe breadwinner the family.\ She contin- \America has long tradition resentment men were aeD,en- The articles in the magazine were '\basically · not take into account 111<: impracticali-ty of a manifesto for men's liberation. Wives wete \keepingtwo people together when they can· considered parasites because they weren't no longer get along.''· Most importantly !tow- working and expected to be supported by ··ever, said EhrenreiCh, is the effectthat the others.'' The message being sent out to ,the abolishment -of the no.-fa11It divorce lias on male read(.'lrs was the question of \Why children.lhe law will create ''notfewer; but share your pay- nastier divorces~\ In hemgobligf:!tedtoprove . check with these either adultery or abuse,. \couples willtm- fe- dergo more l!ancorousdiv()rces, and this will parasites?\ be disruptive to their ehilclren,.\ Ehre:nrejch said. \The summedup Iter argument by sayingthatal- rebellion thougbfeminists.donoten:courage diverce, .grew stron- they believe that \divorc~ is a right, an<l we in the 60s.,\ dotet want to make it harder for peo!lle to continued. have to do it.\ The popularity of The second issue that .she accused the netJDea. to encour- the idealiza- of the single And as gay en because assertive and political system of supporting was; the rest\gmatizi.ngof out-of~wedlock births~ She brought up tlw well-pabUcized incidelltt be~ tween Dan Quayle and the television cllar~ acter Murphy Brown as a classic :e:xam~le of this scapegof.lting.

Wages have decreased by 20% in the 'last ZO years/' she citecf 1 and benefits have declined as well: These statistics have had a \drastic impact on the.family .. .It's 110t an option anymore for the male to be the only breadwinner. But this hasn'tstopped people from arguing that marrying women ·off is the answer to pov- erty.\ In refuting this claim, Ehrenreich stated that according to her calculation, \a woman has to marry2.3 men to get out of poverty.\ . ·Her inference from the changing demo- graphic of the family was that while the \tra- ditional\ family owed its strength. to ~e codependence of the sexes, today's family has changed such that· each sex can sup- port itself in the sense ofstrict survival. \That's fme,\ said Ehrenreich ofthis trend. \In fact, I think it's wonderful that we're less . confined by gender roles [today]. However, there is a problem. Men and women are not equafly !ndependent. \Women earn on av~ erage 70% of what men earn,and the women who are the most handicapped are the ones . raising small children.\ It was Ehrenreich's conclusion that whfle \men gained a lot of .freedom, women gained less, and it's the . children who suffer as a result. Something . I . needs to be changed 1 but what?\ In answering this question, Ehrenreich offered het critical opinion of three issues that today's politicaf system uses to address the family's problem. The first of these is- sues, divorce refonn, is directed towards the aim of trying to abolish the \no-fault\ di- . vorce. This means that a couple can only ·get divorced if one can prove that the other has either been adulterous or abusive. Lastly, Ehrenreich attacked the ,cru.sade of welfare refo1111iststo end promiscuity. The problem witil: these attempts, she saic,. :ties in that \there is no basis in empidcal fact that welfare has served as. an incenti~e to · discourage ·put-of-wedlock hirth!l.\ Ehrenreich suggested instead that the mini ... mum wage be raised in order to accomp)jsh the said objective. ~·ws true that we 1 re in a time of nearly full employment, butther.eare nearly four ntilliotrAmedcans who are now inpart-.tiine jobs and wh~would ratheT IJe in full-timejobs. \She drew from thisthatwages have not risen sufficiently to make single parenthood a feasible option. Again; she emphasized that the most serious damage as a result thereof was that which is ~eing inflicted on children. Her three contentions about the real causes behind the deterioration oftheAmeri~ can family were made i:o encourage tlleau- dience to see beyond the stereotypical scapegoating of feminists. \Don't blame feminism,\ she said. \Men have wanted their fr-eedom als(}, and you can't force pe{)p)e into certain kinds of I iving arrangeme!lts. America needs to get beyond the moralism that clouds these kinds of judgments. The real crisis here is one .of economic and pollti- cal insecurity.\ In proposing her owa solutions tc tl!is problem, Ehrenreich reinforced the p<lten- tial advantages ofraisingtheminimum wage, and also stated that, if in charge, ' 1 1 VV(JU!d make it harder to get manied. I would require a pre-nuptial agreement th\l,t would stat-e llow the couple iptended to provide for their children ... A romantic relationship can Cl()me apart, but the relationship to the child is ab- solute.'; Ehrenreich discouraged the idealiza;ti.nn ofthe conventional family unit, and pointed to the feministmovementas·aleader i~ :pro• viding solid propositions for contemp<Hary society. \We;re being led to believe by pro-farnily rhetor~c that all support can be condens.ed into the family unit, But the family c:an't stand on its own.

This is what femi- \It sounds sensible,'' she said. \But there are at .least three problems with it.\ Ehrenreich stated that there is no concrete evidence which proves an inverse relation- ship between divorce rate and stricter con- ditions of divorce.

Furthennore, the talks are sep&rated into levels so that first- and second-year students can be certain to attend sessions that con- tain mathematics that they should be able to understand. In general, organizers of the conference want to promote undergraduate research in the field of mathematics, and judging by the continued increase in attendance, HRUMC is succeed- ing. This year's program is high- lighted by the introduction of a pun contest and a T-shirt design that promotes the contest: \Mathematics .... Nott Holey Unin- teresting.\ In addition, twelve Union students will be giving fif- teen minute presentations. Senior Laura Dalzell summarized the con- ference by saying, \It is great that so many peopleare willing to share their research, and with this format, we can pick-and-choose what we want to see.\ The entire campus community is invited to attend some of the joint sessions that start at I 0 AM this Saturday in Social Sciences and Humanities.

The challenge to the Committee was extraordinary: we had~ in ef- fect, been asked to redesign the current seven-year Union-AMC joint degree program in a W(lY that spoke to the needs of twe}1ty-fnst century medicine, and to do it in a way that drew on Union's strengths. In response, we identi- fied three qualities that we believed medical leaders would need in the next ce~tury: 1) they would need to be able to understand and re- spond to the ethical and human challenges posed by medical tech- nology; 2) they would need to be able to understand and respond to the shift to manage care; 3) they would need to be able to practice medicine in multicultural context, in a context in which the global vii- Iagebecame increasingly stronger. Once we had recognized these three objectives, we matched them with Union's strengths and devel- oped a proposal for an eight..:year BS- MS-MD program in which stu- dents could earn three degrees in the course of eight years - includ- ing an MS degree in Health Man- agement that would give physi- cians the educational background essential to coping with managed care. The new program .also adds one additional bioethics course, and requires an international expe- rience, such as a term abrQad. Just as importantly, and for the first time, we hav~ opened this program to Union students ,enrolled in the current five year BS-MBAprdgram, albeit withQut the guarantee ofad- miss'ion to medical school. The 'Committee believes that the proposed 8-year Leadership in Medicine program, as well as the proposed Lect.dership in Medicine variant of the 5-year BS-MBApro- gram will provide an. ideal educa- tion for the next generation oflead- ers in medicine. A full report is available at the College Website. A brief summary of the new pro- gram follows. Eight-Y ear Leadership in Medi- cine Joint Union-AMC B.S., M.S. (Health Management), M.D. Program In order to prepare physicians as leaders capable of addressing the managerial, moral, ·and multi- cultural and international chal- lenges facing American medicine in the twenty~first century, Union College and Albany Medical Col- lege will jointlyoffer an enhanced medical leadership program, spe~ cifically designed for students wishing to prepare for the chal- lenge of medical leadership by tak- ing advantage of additional edu .. cational opportunities as part of their undergraduate education.

TheUC-AMC Lea~­ eJ;ship program respends to this need by requi1:ing all students in the joint pmgram to ea.m a masters degree in Health Man- agement. 2) The EthicalChallerige: tra- ditionally, physicians learned ethics at the bedside; today, the ethical challenge to medicine posed by new medical tech- nologies and by the paradigm shift to rnanagedcare and alter- native financing and delivery systems is so .()Verwhelming ~hat systematic fonnal instruc- tiol1 in biomedical eth'icsshould be integral to the education of all physicians, especially the leaders of the JHofession_ The UC-AMC Leadership program responds to this by requiring an integratedprogram offormal instruction in bi()medical ethics and participati()n i~ healthcare practicums, inCluding bioethics courses at both the undergradu- ate and the graduate level, and a special summer program on Health and Humat1 Values. 3) The Leadership Challenge: traditionally, pllysicians were trained to .be leaders in the clinic and in clinical research; today medicine requires physicians who can assumtJ roles of lead- ership well beycmcl the param- eters of the clinic and clinical science.

Later. celebrating the 20th Easter season of his pontificate, he read a message - a blend of light and shadow and hopes and fears- to a big crowd that braved intermittent rain. The Pope said he wanted to pay tribute to those who proclaimed Christ's message \in the concentration camps and the. gulags, under the threat of bombs and guns, amid the terror unleashed by the blind hatred ,,.which has tragically engulfed individuals and whole nations.\ Speakit1g to hundreds of millions of people around the world though live television and radio links with 65 . countries, the Pope said it was necessary to proclaim the peace of Christ \to all humanity on its way to the Third Millennium.\ Blair Invites Clinton to Sell N.

I am very proud ()f my Palestinian heritage that my father and relatives have passed on to me: I often think of the pride my •grandfather, who I called Sedo, would have in me right now if he were alive to walk beside me here at Union. My Sedo died before I turned five but even at that young age I knew he was a strong, proud man who had suffered so much. My Sedo was b()rn and raised in Palestine and later married and raised eight children of b.is own afier my grandmother died a..ta young age .. He worked very hard for all he had which wasn't very m11ch by today's standards- land, oli~e trees, goats, and a home for his children. Perhaps most importantly tllot1gh my Sedo had his pride and <ligliity, riches that have no measure. With the rise of the Zionist movement and search. for a homeland for the Jews my Sedo's pride and dignity was constantly challenged but he kept his headhighand remained proud ofltis success,.ofhis family, and of his heritage. Maybe my grandfather believed hisPalestine would never be taken away frombim or maybe he didn't want t() face reality. I don'treally know but when \Israel was born\ in 1948 my grandfather,. my aunts and uncles, a11d the rest of my relatives worst fear came true. Everything they had worked so hard for was taken from them while they lived in constant fear (){fsraeli violence. My family is peaceful, though scorned and hurt, and emotionally battered every day attllethoughtoflosing everything for no faultoftheirown. No matter how many times statistics of violence towards Israelis by the Palestinians are thrown in my face, I wonder what·consolation can be given to my family who has done nothing bwt stood back up every time they were shot down, compromising their dignity. The formation of Israel has caused an infinite amount of problems, espedally violence and many human rights violati()llS, on both sides. I am so tired ab()ut hearing theories ab&ut why Jews should have and definitely deserve Israel because that is accepti11g that my family deserved what they got. I also realize though that these extremist violent views demoitstrated by such terrorist gr()ups as Harnas are disgraceful displays of the unrealistic view that the Palestiniims will gain all their land back and all Israelis will pack up and leave. I still have many relatives living in the former Palestine, including an aunt who I love very dearly. I have visited several times in my life and marveled at the beauty of the country while cringing at the cross- fire in the amazing city of Jeaiem. I realize that Arabs and Jews need to cooperate towards the common goal of peace and I hope l will be alive to see this day.

OP/ED PoiNTLESS 0BSERV ATIONS \Below the Belt\ on the President by David Kavegmti Opinions Editor Being back in Features this week, I thought that most people would be too stupid to tmd rne and then keep asking me, \why didn't you write this week?\ So, I thought that I would just take a week to write aiJout something different. Here it goes: I wasjustthinking the other day about how pathetic president Clinton is. We !lave a president that tries to be jast like JFK. But you kn.ow what? He does a terrible job! How sad does is it make you feel when the best our president can do is Monica Lewinski? It's sad be- cause the only reason our Presi- dent cheats on his wife is because he wants to be Hl<e his idol, John F. Kennedy. However, instead of Marilyn Monroe, Clinton lowers the level of difficulty and seeks instead the likes.ofPaulaJones and regwlar letters department: Now that your ADD i.~ cured, does this mean that your column is going to suck? Well, let me let you in on a little secret. It always has. sucked. Sorry to break the news devoted reader. Last week I almost got the boot from one of our 11ew editors. But, that's a different story. Did you really change your name? That seems like such a stupid idea, but then again, I consider the source. Think whatever you want about me changing my name, but my grandpa did it for certain reasons and I do it for others. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~oiliu\tr~utrn~.~Howp~~tic Please tell my why you mentioned Erin Rosenberg in your last column winter term.

Finding Adulthood College represents a passage to adulthood. A learnin11; experience, filled with bizarre combinations of life situations that serve to prepare us for the obstacles ofthe \real world.\ Throt~gh the cl<Jallenge ofrigorous classes and the trying nature of often intense emotional and personal stmggles, the fresh- man teen is expected to leave college a mature, twenty-s()mething adult. These four years serve a grand purpose in the end. Lea-ving home to find oneself here or at any college amidst the bustle of the maturatioN process is not exactly the most enjoyable experience. There is so much uncertainty and breaking away from the seemingly infallible ideoiogies es.ta~lished loag since childhood. Many of the morals and patterns ofbehaviortlut marked adoles- cence and the \growing into\ adulthood need to be left behind. Students often come to college carrying remnants of arckaic values, created by peers and defined by the overwhelming pulse of societal pressure. College is sup- posed to represent an evolution away from the pettiness and m.isconceptions of frivolous youth. Somehow, thougk, a part of Union College had missed the mark on that concept of personal growth ... thousands of supposedly innocent, lilac-col· ored sheets of xerox paper distributed to the graduating 5eniors have served to diminish the value of the Union College student body as a pulsing, intelli- gent, socially-aware cohesion of mature minds. Yes, the Garnet Yearbook has decided to rehash the ultimate higl1 school relic. Senior Superlatives. !'low, this is not to bclittk the achie\-=ments of the (iarn~t stuff or the'' ork that has gone into pulling out thr: yeurhonk. llm\C\Cr. the bet that l'ninn l'olkge;: happens to hi.! a small school \\herL' the majoril) of students kno\\ each other does not warrant the existence of the outdated Senior Superlatiw. Granted, the idea may he a cutesy attempt at creating a more personal addition to the Garnet Yearbook's hard-covered, bound pages of memories. but the implications that go along with superlatives are so1newhat degrading. At an institution where learning and personal maturatior1 are the main goals, \popularity contests\ seem to be a bit contradictory to tile intents of the col- lege experience. Because of its size, Union College ofte!l already falls into the petty entrapments of a high school environment, anc! voting on who's \Best Looking\ in the senior class doesn't exactly help t() change that. Are we not past the awful stereotypes of bubble-headed, flighty teenag- ers? This is not high school anymore, this is an institution of higher learning. Although many students are not yet ready to embark on the adventurous ride known as adulthood, hopefully the ma,jority of them have learned to develop independent minds and break away from the \status\ of J>OJlularity. Achieve- ment and self-worth do not have anything to do with who ¥Vas voted as \Best Personality\ or \Most Likely to Succeed.\ Until \Ve, us students and as indepem.lcnt thinkers, learn to turn away from the superficial standards being forced upon us by some ~xtcrnal, socially- twisted force, we cannot possibly ''grew up.\ Being an adult does not mean having to throw away the innocence ()f vibrant energy or youth, but it does entail removing the greatest social crutch of childhood ... otherwise know as \Popularity.\ There is something to be said for being socially accer>ted and acknowl- edged as a contributing and creative addition to society, but it is a very dif- ferent thing to be awarded for having the '~Best Smile\ in town. As adults, it is time we realized that recognition should come from perseverance and sub- stantial achievement. It should not be based on what friends fill your social circle or how many nights a week you party. Being able to break free from these superficial and completely immature social markers is what separates adults from children. Hopefully, we are no longer children.

The second in a series of opinions from a freshman student Anonymous We, as a people, see false adver- ing occur everyday yet either it oesnt register or we simply do ing about it. This never really occurred to me il the other night when I went rent a movie at Blockbuster ideo with some friends. We de- ided to rent Charlie and the Roald Dahl to sort of relive our ldhood. While we were there, I decided buy a box of Willy Wonkas Ev- lasting Gobstoppers. In the ie, the lucky ticket winners get o sample the everlasting bstoppers, which last forever. owever, the Gobstoppers I lbotJ2.htclaimed that they lasted for- ' but the last time I checked minutes is not forever. OK, they do taste pretty good and change colors but those are not excuses for lying to the Does anyone ever feel slightly disgruntled when they buy a box oflaundry detergent, for exam pie, that claims it will make your clothes sparkle and shine, yet it doesn't even remove the stains? lve tried Tide, Downy, Cheer, and All, and my stains have yet to be \lifted up\ until I take them to the dry cleaners. So I suppose in that respect, weve all been lied to. But what about those times when we are lied to and don't re- alize it until months later. One example of this type of\false ad- vertising\ happens right here at Union College. Union College claims that we are a prestigious college with only the finest stu- dents. If our school community is so intelligent, why is there a large number of us who do not care about our studies and are on academic warning? In no way am I ragging on the student body because if a student cannot do well, that is their own business; however, I am insulting the school's policies in that they claim the entire school C()mmunity works hard academically but that, I am sorry to say, is untrue. Some of our students do work very hard, but others do not. Union College should not use those few who do well academi- cally as a stat is tic, but rather in- clude the whole majority, includ- ing those who don't do as well, for their campaigning processes. What Union College does do is manipulate the n urn bers to pro- duce a statistic which makes un- knowing prospectives believe tllat every student here is into their studies and willing to learn. Again. I felt betrayed when I became aware of this \false advertising.\ In writing this, I can't speak for the entire population but I can say for myself that false advertising bothers me. It makes the consum- ers believe that they are buying a product which has good intentions and will work. Of course a one dollar box of gobstoppers and a three dollar b()x of laundry detergent are not t()o costly, but it does anger me that Ive been mislead. However, in my opinion, $30,000 is a large price to pay for being mislead.

Why is it that everywhere I walked on campus the past week I smelled barbecue? I love ham- burgers and hot dogs as much as the next person, but the smell is starting to get to me. The good news is that this is a sure sign that spring has arrived in full force. That makes me happy. Well, that about does it for my column for this week. I hope ev- eryone continues to have a great spring term. As always, you can write at Box #2037 with any com- ments or questions and I will get back to you.

I 16, 1998 • GI11Utorbie1tsis past and happened to visit the new mall just built outside my town. The Pyramid Mall is a huge complex filled with store upon store and more movie theaters than there are movies actually released for show- ing. There are multiple shoe st@res, multiple sports apparel centers, and multiple hamburger-french fry-chicken sandwich-typ·e. dis- tributors. Every trendy, brand- name clothing store is there, with blazing letters across the front of its doors, enticing shoppers into its web of overpriced non-necessities. The mall,. frankly; is ridiculous. A perfect example ·Of tile_ Qurrent state ofextravagance in which our society exists. There is too much of everything. Everyone likes to· buy new things. New purchases make y~u feel strangely good and lend a quiet sense of satisfacfi()n. Going shopping can be a pick-me-up ... for both the male and female sexes. I get excited over a new pair of jeans and I know my Dac loves his power tools. My brother is perhaps the best example of someone who finds joy in acquiring purchases. His latest craze is basketball cards, prompted by his love of Michael Jordan and desire to make money off of the latest rookie whose card is growing exponentially in mar- ket value. For a 13-year old kid, he has the most intricate and me- ticulous list of all the prices for his \major\ cards ... ranging from $20 to $500. Honestly, if he took the whole collection and sold it today, he's probably have enough money to start his own basketball card factory. The thing is, he buys like an ani- mal. His card collection is always growing, infesting the kitchen drawers, garage storage area and even the attic. I don't e\en know how much money he bas spent over the last few years and he is mg style of card and the newest inno- vation in basketball card artistry (they actually have cards that are textured to feel like a. basketball). I think that his littJe.compulsion is basically the fault .of being too fortunate. He can't,possibly value the individual cards or anything else that he has, because simply he has too much of everything. Pos- sessions become .that much more va]uable when they are rare or harder to acquire..

Honestly, my father is always telling me some story about how when he came to this country he owned three pairs of pants and two shirts.

\ This performance ranks up there with Baldwin's evil charac- . ters in Ma:lice, The M~rcury Rising to invest- gate the murder, and Agent Art Jeffries (Bruce Willis) fmds the boy named Simon \Lynch (Miko Hughes). Unaware of the reasons behind the hit on die child, Jeffries engages in a race against time to protect the boy while trying to discover both who ,js behind the killings and secrets th:e boy holds. Edge, and The Juror_'' A team ofexperts at the United States National Security Agency . have just developed a new supercede, one which cannot be cracked, 'even by the most ad- vanced computers. In order to test whatthey deemed the \human fac• tor,\ two NSA agents, without pet- mission from their superiors, place a coded message in a puzzle maga- zine. The message, if deciphered, instructs the solver to call a 1-800 number to claim their prize. One day the phone rings. It is an autis- tic nine year old boy. Lt. Colonel' Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin) is infuriated that two ofhis agents placed the cryp- togram in a puzzle book. The fact that someone could break the code jeopardizes the lives of U.S. agents in other countries. Kudtow's ca- reer at the NSA is now ,in trouble and citing that -it is a matter of na- tional security, orders the boy's death. The hit man, dressed as an airconditioningrepainnan, kiUsthe boy's parents but cannot find the boy, who has concealed himself1n a craw I space.

With a cast of around 1h irty and a full crew including music director and dramaturge, this show is going to be the biggest thing I've ever worked on in se~en years of theater. There were more peopl~ in that theater than I've seen at some perfor- mances. Unfortunately, I walked in twenty mi:nutes late for the rehearsal, after having gotten lost on Route 7 in a somewhat embarrassing incident that t would prefer not to relate. After apologizing to Professor Biii.Finlay, the director, and Chris Welch, our stage man- ager, I sat down and tried to take in. what was going on. Apparently I'd missed the obligatory introductions as well as most of Bill's pep talk about how he felt the prodl!c- tion was going to work. I'm a little annoyed that I missed tile in- troductions. Luckily, I've worked with ev- eryone on the production crew before, ex- cepting the music director, and I know newly all the actors and actresses with speaking parts, so it won't be entirely new. On the other hand, there are a lot of new faces in- volved, people I've ne•·er seen in a Theater Dept. show, I always I e to work with ni:Jw people, but on the other hand I'm always curious as to now they' II work into the cast dynamic. Sometimes it can be ::hard t(} do a Dept. show with people who have never done it before - no matter how much you warn them, they're never really prepared for the overwhelming commitment it turns out to be. After receiving a lot of information from the production staff regarding the details of the rehearsal procedures (we're actually going to be able to get our rehearsal sched~ ule over the phone- nice!) and the set, we brake so that we could elect Lori Greene as Equity Deputy .. She;ll be the cast's liaison to the production crew for any complaints or requests we might have -a bigjob with such a large cast. We .fi lied out contact and conflict sheets for Chris, got measured for costumes (I was pleasantly surprised- our costumer still has my measurements from Noises Off!, back in Spring '96), picked up scripts, and headed off into our -first read- through. This is when I really started to get excited. Even at our first read-through, you could tell how some of the scenes, some of the dialogue, were going to come off. Witb a few exceptions, the whole cast is on stage at all times, with the inmates, guards; and sis- ters providing a backdrop to the main ac- tion. Often they'll step forward into the fore· ground, such as when my character, Coulmier, orders the guards to restrain the inmates,who have become llnru!y. Looking at the sh~vv through rny chllfactet's eyes, it seems li~e a struggle between Coulmier, Marat,alld Sade (played by Eric Wisotzky and Ari Gottlieb, respectively) to impose their oW!l vision oforder Ointo the lives of theasylurn inmates. We begin blocking (setting up how the actors move on stage~ when, where, etc.) on Monday. Over the weekend, 1 talked to a .few of my fellow actors, alldwe all seemed to have the same feeling .,..- a sense of awe tinged by fear. This show is a monster. A juggema11t looming on the horizon. Its mass could either explode into a wondrous super- novaorc()Jlapse under itsow11Weight. Right now is too soon to tell. Knowing, however, that Professor Finlay has been p~anning this for nearly a year now at least, we put our faith in bis skill and that of the production staff. If everyone pulls his or her weight, this show may be the best ,thing Union's seen for as long as I've been here. Next week: rehearsals beg:in.

Well, to assessthat, we must hop a train through Union's history of theater overthe last five terms, ·A period I like to call, the \Gottlieb Era,\ one fll11 of twists and turns that have led up to this point; I take you back to Fall of 1996. The producti~tt of \Equuis'' was on stage at Yulrnan Theater. This psychological story of horses and whatnot presented a young actor by the name of Ari. Gottlieb with a chance to make his markonUnion theaterhistoiy. The play was, to say the least, interest- ing hut it was hindered by the fact that the lead character was played by a hired professional actor. As the first show I had seen produced here, r got a chance to see some interesting roles such as horses being played by Carey Miller, Rawson Thurber, Greg Van Olt and Sunil Schneider. The story was a bit offbeat for my young mind, but little did l know what was to fol- low. American families are actually aliens, so lets make a play abo11t it. And while we're at it, lets throw in some of the mostextravagantcos,.. tumes this little college has ever seen. \Tales of the Lost Forniicans;' came cemp1ete with ev- erything from a program coloring contest to a fresh cast.;ofnew stars. '\Tales\ starred then Freshmen Lori Greene,. Kim Rohback, and Eric Wisotzky, with old souls (ike Mor- gm Hargrove and Randy Pellish. The acting was some of the best l'\ve seen at Union. The show as a wh<lle was a bit hard to follow and a few miles over tlte cuckoo- cuckoo's nest.

I would recommend taking someone whom is at least a little familiar with Thai food. The evening as a whole was a very cultund experience. Our server was extremely fiiendly and everything, from water to the check, was brought to us in a prompt and c<>urteous fashion. Bangkok was not wretchedly expensive. Our festival-of-fun was ap- proximately ten dollars each. It is also a bit of a drive from Union.

Baseball by Jason Everett Sports Writer The 1998 version of the Union College Swinging Dutchmen holds ~he potential to be a very strong team. With a core of re- turning players coupled with a number oftalented freshmen, this team came into the season with hopes of surpassing their mere playoff birth last year as they as- pire towards winning the ECAC tournament, or even possibly gaining a birth in the NCAA tournament. Regard- less of their success, the team at least hopes to continue on their recent path of growing success. After a number of final player cuts, and weeks of intensive training, the baseball team began its season under the sunny, blue skies of Fort Myers, Florida.

As fortbemen, since the establishment of the cup in 199I Union has never been able to place its nameonit-untilnow. Some have called it, \the great• est victory for the men side since the follr which won Nationals in 1993..\ After seven years of strug- gling against Hobart, Union ere~ established itself as a f<>rce. Know- ing thatHobarfs race plan is to get out ahead in the first half of the race a11d then just hartg on to the lead, Union began pressing early. After 750 meters Union was down two se:ats (a quarter of a boat length) when they made the first of two moves on Hobart. In twenty super powerful and ef'ficient determination that Union coaches have instilled in the rowers. Largely undersized and rowing against a two time defending Division II/IH WiUiam Smith team, the women's crew rowed with a confidence and skill not seen in past years. Usu- ally a slaughter from tbe start Union was able to hang with William Smith forsmnetim.e. Unfortunately, the women were not able to over- come the great feat of this power- house; yet, the loss by only three boat lengths has been by far the closest since the varsity women won in 1994. In addition, the Hobart and William Smith coach · said thathe woald not oe surprised lfthe Union ccaches bad a varsity women; screw at the same level as perience that those four varsity rowers broughtto William Smith's . Women's Lacrosse Beats RPI In Overtime . - - - byRoryStem .Staff Writer It was yet another hectic week for theDutchwomen lacrosse tearn. After c()ming off a doubleheader the pre'Vious weekend. they had one day to prepare for Middlebury, the Division III champion from last season. \Two hours is not enough time to prepare for such a team as Middlebury,'' said head coach Linda Bevelander, who seemed quite optimistic when speaking about tile game. Unfortunately, the game did not go as sbe h~d hoped. · Th<i! team lost 17·2, hut was by no means a disapp'o intment to her. According to Bevelander,. normal scores for Middlebury range up in the twen- ties. \f was not disappointed at all;. mydefense was excellent. I fit was not for them, the score could have been much worse,\ added the coach. The Dutchwomen held Middlellury scoreless for eight min- utes in the second half due to a zone defense. As for the future, Bevelat'lder remains confident in her team and would like to work more on the.offense. \lam aggres- sive, and l want my offense to be aggressive. I wo-lild like to .see them go to goal for a shot or even draw a foul. This team has nothing to lose, and everything to gain.\ Speaking with tbe coach, she was quite reassuring and po.sitive about these statements. Their schedule continued with two games agai11 this last weekend, which the Dutchwomeli split. On Friday., they faced off against Skidmore and l<lst this one 12-9. Scoring for Union were Shdko Okado, Abigail Harris, and Lauren Pastor, each scoring ..twice. It seemed like a11 off day for the Dutch women; wbi1e even their con- sistently strong goal keeper was off Maura W4Jessner had 5 saves on 17 shots.. Moving on to Satur- day, the team faced RPI; and played quite an intense and close game of lacrosse. The contest even went into double ovettime, where the Dutchwomen exploded and won their first UCAA game 8-6. Scor- ing yet again fdr the Dutchwomen when it counted most were, Pas· tor, Okada, and Harris. Each scored in the overtime session. Pastortied the game, Okado put in the win- ning goal, and Harris netted an in- surance goal with 3 l ticks remain- ing ,on the clock. As for Woessner, she played a solid game, as usual, and had seven saves for the game. \Tile game was quite a crowd pi easer,'' Bevelander stated. \Tiley came together and played . like a team, like they are capable of playing. It was just plain awesome, l am very proud. I believe in them, they have the ability to win the UCAA, its a matter of staying fo- cused and believing in their own ability.\ As their strenuous season con- tinues, the squad seems to be grow- ing rapidly and pulling things to- getlter. Speaking yet again with Bevdander, the team has an excel- lent chance at finishing the season 6-1 over the next two weeks. This coming week, they face Oneonta on and then return home for the weekend. Although their record of 2-4 does not.show their talent, the team continues to strive for improvement, and seems promis- ingto their. very competitive coach.

During her time at Union, the virtuoso envi.,. ronmental science major and co .. captainofthe track team has exem- plified and redefine:d what a cos- mopolitan student-lltblete should be. Athletics has beem a fixture in Goveia' s life since high school at Bridgewater-Raynam where she pl'ayed field hockey and track. Although she >loved field hockey, Goveia didnotgo omtfor the .squad at Union, deciding t-o concentrate on running, gettirng, what she described as \more serious,\ Just as she enjoyed succe.ss playing field hocke-y due to her speed and endurance, these traits_ have paid large dividends in her track career as well. .Admitting that she stuck with runiling in high school because she \ell:joyed it and was just good at it,'' Geveia has developed a :tremendous competitiveness and a love for the sport which has repeatedly prevented her from leaving the sport when she has questioned whether she was overextending herself in her activities at Union. When asked why she stayed with track this year while sirnultaneouslytakingmultiple lab classes and participtating in the Union College Choir,. and taking guitar lessons, Goveias:aidthatshe felt that; \Running is just such a huge part of me a:nd keeps everything in balance:. It's nice to have somethingto go to and keeps me happy. I think iff didn'thave something to go to in the middle of the day, I might actuadlydo worse [academically J. The people on the team are just a:lot offu11.tohewith.\ It is p.erhaps Goveia' s competitiveness that is the real reason why she has stuck with the sport and why she dellided to join the cross-country tearn this past year. · Goveia's fierce competitiveness quici:ly revealed itself during her fre5hman year soon after joining the indoor squad. Although she downplays her competitivenes-s rtelentlessly saying that she is alld was \not competitive,\ this is either a vast understatement pa:ralhel to saying that the Titanic was just a little unseaworthy, or it simply is true, with her success sirnJIY being a result of enotmous natural talent and hard work. In her three years ().f running track at Union, Go:veia bas run in the finals ofthe IndoOT track state championships every year in the lOOOm. Inthestatechwnpionshlps her freshman year, G()veia used a tremendous fmishing Ieick over the final two laps of the r11ce to move from being out of co11tention to finishing fourth in a talented field. This performance capped an · outstanding season for Goveia and although her coaches looked optimistically towatds. the future, Goveia was u:11sure re!llly what to mmce of her quick success. \It 11ll happened S()randomly.

I am glad I made it through that hellish race.\ Judging from these comments, <me would think that Gove.ia had simply packed it in and concen- trated on simply surviving the race without getting frostbite, one should not be misled. Goveia had a stellar race fmishing fifty~fust out fJf one hundred and fifty runners in a time of 19:26. Although Gbveia followed this outstanding cross-country season with yet another tremendous in- door campaign, Goveia had a bit of bad luck comethestatechampion- ships held at Union in February. Despite being sick anti unable to do more than a superficial warm- up, Goveia ran tenaciously, once again making the finals in the lOOOm. In the finals, an officiating miscue had the runners run an ex~ tta lap in the seven lap contest, ad- versely impacting upon Goveia's strategy to use a late surge to chal- lenge for\a medal. Although Goveia finished seventh, she ran a .personal best time of3: I 1 (without the extra lap) and remains within striking distance of that e'Jer-elu- sive school record of3:09. Goveia is determined to \do something marine related\ upon graduation whether it is \working with marine animals or policy re- lated.\ Goveia has had this passion t() work in a marine related field since an early age and is deeply appreciative towards her father for encouraging her and supporting her in this quest. \Ever since I was very young I have loved animals in general, particularly with an in- terest in the ocean. When r was in the sixth grade I got certified to go scuba diving with my father. He did-itforme. Thatwasareallybig thing. He has really helped my dream come true.\ Jessica Goveia is unquestion- ably one of the most athletically talented and well rounded students to come through, not just the Union track program, but, Union College as a whole .. Through hard work and a seemingly limitless amount of natural talent, Goveia has found success in virtually ev- ery event she has attempted in track, whether it is in the mid-dis- tance events in the IOOOm, an oc- casional step-down to the 400m, or racing5K in cross-country. Goveia has been virtually perfect in aca- demics since returning to Union after her term abroad and has re- cently begun to exploit her previ- ottsly untapped musical talents. As great as Goveia' s tenn abroad may have been- with academic and athletic success coming to her o11ce again this tenn, in addition to having her lifelong dream of work- ing in a marine related field tanta· lizingly close in her future, Gove ia is certainly finding that this period now is perhaps as good as it gets. ,.

Numerous academic conferences and award ceremo- nies also occur duriQg this pro- verbial time of graduation. On Wednesday, April 22, Union will send 49 students to Salisbury (Maryland) State University for a three-day National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR). Union students have been par~ . ticipatin:g in the conference since its inception in 1987. Union has also had the honor of hosting the conference twice. The first tirue was in 1990 and the last time in 1995. The49 students, one ofthe largest contingents that will be attending the conference, will present their research in a variety of fields ranging from Psychology to Civil Engineering. Many of tllo:se presenting will utilize their s~nior thesis research in their talks. Thomas Werner, chair of the NCUR Board of Governors state<l that, \We have been multi-discif)'lill- ary in the extreme with equalllum- bers of students from both areas (arts and sciences), which reflects our mission.\ NCUR gives under- graduates the opportunity to be e:x- posed to a large audience in a vvay that few conferences do. There are two types of presenta- tions at NCUR. The first is known as a \poster presentation.\ It cofl- sist.s of the presenter composing, and designing posters detailing and explaining the presentation.

This allows religious and educational institu- tions to apply for a special use permit in historic districts.

Union College wants to move stu- dents into these houses in theme- house environments, similar to the ones currently on campus.

Numerous academic conferences and award ceremo- nies also occur duriryg this pro- verbial time of graduation. On Wednesday, April22, Union will send 49 students to Salisbury (Mary land) State University for a three-day National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR). Union students have been par- ticipating in the conference since its inception in 1987. Union has also llad the honor of hosting the conference twice. The first time was in 1990 and the last time in 1995. The 49 students, one of the largest contingents that wi II be atte11d ing the conference, will present their research in a variety of fields ranging from Psychology to Civil Engineering. Manyofthose presenting will utilize their s!;!n ior thesis research in their talks.

THE S·CHENECTADY METROPLEX- UNION INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY? by Shaun P. Montana Staff Writer Can you picture a sports and movie complex within a ten minute walk <JfUnion's campus? Are y(}U drearning when you read this.? Schenectady residents, local busi- ness and community leaders, and Union's own President Roger Hull are not dreaming either. In recent weeks, the Schenectady County Legislature unanimously approved a plan which will allow for the formation of the Schenectady Metroplex Au- thority. This sixteen member board will be a state authority which over- sees the formation of the Metroplex in Downtown Schenectady. The plan calls for a redevelop- ment and revitalization of portions of the surrounding area in an ef- fort to make it more attractive t() new businesses and tourists. And to generate more pride in the City of Schenectady. The plan is split into two parts. The first part would involve redevelopment downtown, with many current old buildings demolished to make room for the Metroplex. This Metroplex would include a large convention center, a luxury hotel, a high-speed railroad an<! bus station, movie theatres, a sports complex, and multiple office spaces, all located in the heart ()f downtown Schenectady. The sec- ond part of the plan woald involve multiple improvements along Routes 5 and 7. The Metroplex plan was formulated by Schenectady 2000, lead by Presi- dent George Robertson, Founder and Chairman Neil M. Golub, and ••rhe pfan calls for 11 redevelopment and revitalization of por- tions of the surround- ing area in an effort to make it more at- tractive to new busi- nesses and tourists. \ Roger HulL President Hull has also served as one of the chief fundraisers for the project, which has estimated costs of around $150 million. Much of this money would come from private investments, but the rest of the money will come from other sources. These sources are the cause 0of the current roadblock ofthe project. The Metmp lex plan is part ofthe negotiations in the state budget. Initially, tile bill approved by the County Le~islature asked for $25 million in state funding and gave the goveme>rthe ability to appoint the Metroplex Authority chair and vice-chair. These positions are volunteer, as are all positions on the Authority. The chair is especially important as they would have the power to hire a paid executive director for the Authority. However New York Governor George Pataki, who sup- ports the plan, has supposedly decided he does not want the abil- ity to appoint the chair and vice- chair, leaving the organization of the Authority in the air. Only $7.5 million of the initial $25 million has . been approved by the state bud- get. Another way the Authority plans to raise money is by raising local sales taxes to 7.5 percent in- stead of the current 7 percent. This is projected to generate another $7.5 million per year for the project. So far the Authority can exist, but its composition is unknown and it does not yet have any pennanent building plans. Some local Schenectady resi- dents are also challenging the con- stitutionality of the authority, claim- ing public money should not be used for a private expenditure. For now, while the budget is de- cided upon in Albany, and the questions of control, plans, and constitutionality are answered in Schenectady, we' II all just have to keep dreaming about the Metroplex.

Councilmember Margaret King was the next to speak, and spoke of her interest in the situation, as a resident ofthe actual GE Realty Plot herself. She visited Wells House at Union College and was im- pressed with her visit, and was pleased that the college had pr()- posed si1nilar living environments for the properties on Lenox Road She too announced she would v<Jte yes as well.

Wendy McElroy Speaks on Women's Right to Pornography by Heather Buanno Contributing Writer The Womyn's Union will host Wendy McElroy, authorofXXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography on Monday,.April27 at 7:30 PM in the College Center Auditorium. McElroy's speech is entitled\Feminism and Sex Work.\ Wendy McElroy started her career as a women's tights advocate when she oper- ated a feminist bookstore in Los Angeles, California. Currently, McElroy resides in ru- ral Canada with her husband, and she writes and speaks in favor of both pornography and feminism. In her arguments, McElroy states that every woman should have the opportunity to enjoy their sensuality. Feminists for Free Speech argue, \McElroy provides a rare and insightful vantage on the porn industry that will change the way we look at the current pornography debate.\ McElroy believes that pornography ben- efits women; her crusade for feminism and pornography stems from her genuine love for free speech rights and for human diver- sity. McElroy has written two other books pertaining to feminism and censorship: Lib- erty and Freedom and Feminism and the State. McElroy has spent the past two. years of her life interviewing those directly involved n the porn industry: actresses, cameramen, and producers. She plans to recount her nterviews with these individuals and make a case as to how one can advocate pornog- raphy and still be labeled a \feminist.\ McElroy will also be addressing the \white phenomenon\ that has swept the porn in- dustry. JUNIOR ECONOMIC~ McElroy is currently working on her sec- · ond book that examines prostitution in the United States. She has spent many hours interviewing numerous ca:ll girls. McElroy · will also debunk the myths surrounding callgirls vs. streetwalkers.\ McElroy is a strong advocate of COYOTE, a prostitution rights group that is gai11i.ng popularity in the United States. McElroy's main message is that, \not ev- ery woman should read or watch pornogra- phy. lt is that every woman should decide for herself.\ The Womyn's Union would also like to stress this message. Last year the Womyn's Union brought Dr .. Jean Kilbourne, who addressed the negative as- pects of women, advertising, and pornogra- phy. ' This year, the Womyn's Union wished to bring someone who would be able to chal- lenge Kilbourne's view,points, hopefully Union students will be able to decide for themselves. The Womyn 's Union would like to stress that we do not support nor con- demn pornography. Ourobjectivewith bring- ing Wendy McElroy to Union is to present one's opinion about pornography and en- courage intellectual debate. McElroy is a committed feminist who be- lieves in free speech rights and advocates pornography as an expressive form. McElroy has spent many years working on behalf of the pornography industry through- out the United States. We hope that you will be able to join us this Monday at 7:30PM in the College Cen- ter Auditorium to hear :her exciting argu- ments. There will be a reception in the Women's Center with Mc£lroy immediately following her speech. All are welcome to attend.

Felipe Luciano·Speaks about Cultural Awareness· by Roberto R()drig11ez StaffWrfte.r Tile past two week:s have been very successful at U nffon College. The Dialogues on !lace topics have become the ta:l k ofthe .catn- pus. Tile different organizations, Greek houses, staff, ana faculty have gathered together t() discuss issues that affect our col lep;e com- munity. The Dialo gue.s on Race talks have become very i!nportant because everything that was dis- cussed was between the Whites and the Blacks exc.lllcling the Latino. Last Wednes.day ,ApriJ15th the Latino Heritage rM()nth Com- mittee had as their keyl1()te speaker Felipe Luciano, foun.derandChair- man ofthe Young Lords :Party, an organization active in community empowe1ment. Luciano spoke ab[)llt cultural awareness and about the majority of tile groups who imunigrated to the United States at ()Jle important time. Luciano started his speech about how dialogues tOri race top- ics are mostly abO<uft Whites or Blacks. The question remains; Where do Latinos fa'll i11to place? Are Latinos just in tlile rn iddle of the two races? Luciano states that:it's only been a while since the Civil Rights Move- ment and the right t() V<ote. So how can Blacks or Latin()s; say that we are doing a good job ~o~Yi til race re- lation? We have a I on g -way to go.

Luciano saidthat Latinos witlcometopower like earlier immigrant groups have. As of right now, due to media por- trayal Latinos are seen as the worst group. The third generation of Latinos will see that they do not want to be like their father and mother and they will educate them- selves and bring power to Latinos in the United States. Luciano admires the Jewish American because they have taught him to fight back and be- come a radical person. He said that Latinos .need to teach Blacks that many of our cultural background is from Africa. The ignorance of it is very silly between Latino and Blacks. A key point that Luciano made was that Latinos are the \citizen of the world\ because they have a combination of European, African and Native blood. The ten catego- ries of color definition is proof who we are. Luciano said that racism is the lack of love and that it brings hatred among different groups. Our job is to serve our community and see ourselves as new Ameri- cans who see one another in dif- ferent ways not just the color of our skin. -THEME HousE WEEK A Su·ccEss ON UNION CAMPUS by Shana Dan~:el<J Copy Editorr On Saturday n~g;ht, Th.eme House Week started! off with a and their activities. \We'd lfke to promote awareness of tlleme houses on campus,\ said Theme House Consortium President Au- tumn Proernm. Another intention of the event is to, \help members party, planned by Bronner House member Jordanna Mallach and Treehouse member Shana Dangelo, Theme House Week was the appropriate time to hold Jeop- ardy! at Chet's on Monday night. Union Students participating in Jeopardy! party at Wells House Vllhere a11 gath- ered enjoyed an ev-ening of fun, food, and great musk. Theme House We~k is a week long celebration of tlueme houses of houses get to know other,\ Proemm commented about <lther purposes and functions of the week. After Saturday night's kickoff Wells House President Alex Polemeropopoulos donned a tux~ edo and served as host for the event, while Mallach was dressed to kill to serve as Vanna. Categories inclucfed Union Col- lege History, Union College Sports, American H ist<ny, and many oth- . ers. Final Jeopardy!, fittingly enough, was Theme Houses. Smith House was the only team to an- swer the final ques1ion correctly, and won with a total of$3201. In actuality, they won $100 to go to- wards house programming. Kelen Barr, Wells House team member, had a good time and thought it was a \good way to get all the houses together.\ Jess Chappell, Treehouse team member said of the time spent, \it was great, it was lots of fun,\ and she also \espe- cially liked Alex and Jordanna's outfits.\ On Tuesday night, Theme House Week activi1ies continued with the usual Tues<:lay night Cof- feehouse. It was p11t on by mem- bers of The Society in Raymond North. It was Qpen microphone night, and Coffeehouse did not fail to please all those who attended the event. On Wednesday ni:ght, Thurston House hosted a reu11ion for all the students that went all on the term abroad in South Asia this past win- ter term. Tonight, Theme House Week concludes with Smith House host- inga dinner open to the campus as they do every Thursday night, ex- cept that Bronner House will be lending a hand to the preparation of tile food, and, no doubt, will as- sist in eating it too. Rosters were due for theme houses last week, so Theme House Week was not a recruitment by the consortium. Proemm wishes that more ofthe campus would, \come to events and learn what theme houses have to offer.\ It was merely a co incidence that this year's Theme House Week di- rectly succeeded this year's Greek Week and Proemm said that there is no intent by the Theme House Consortium to directly compete with Greek Week.

A Khmer Rouge spokesman told reporters at Sa-ngaam Pass on the Thai-Cambodian border that Pol Pot was cremated in mid-morning opposite a wooden shack where his body was displayed to the press Thursday. Po); Po~ was architect of the ultra-leftist \kiUing fields\ regime which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 and was blamed for the deaths ofmore than one million Cambodians, main~y from forced labor and starvation. The 73-year-old former guen:illa leader, who had become increasingly frail, apparently died Wednesday of heart faihue. The private cremation ceremony was attended by about 20 people, mainly Khmer Rouge followers, and lasted for about I 5 minutes, said spokesman Nuan No. As he spoke, reporters could hear the thunder of mortar and tank rocket shells reverberating from Khmer Rouge-held areas as fighting raged between guerriUas and Cambodian government troops reported to have taken the group's nearby stronghold of Anlong Veng. Images seen on local television in Thailand showed guerrillas carrying a coffin draped in a colored blanket and adorned by a bunch ofwh ite and pink flowers. They placed the coffin on a cremation pyre along with Pol Pot's humble personal and favorite belongings, includmg his walking stick, rocking chair and mattress. The pyre of wood and used car tires was then splashed with gasoline and lit by a Khmer Rouge soldier. More gasoline was then thrown on the fire, stoking the flames and sending up a column ofthick black smoke. There were no eulogies or speeches made at the ceremony. Unionists, Sinn Fein Debate N.Irish Accord BELF AST{Reuters)- Northern Ireland's rival unionist and republican parties gathered their ranks Saturday to debate a peace deal that endorses the province's British status but builds bridges with Ireland. Both the main pro-British Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Sinn Fein, which strives for all-Ireland unity, faced heated internal debates <Jver the historic accord intended to end 30 years of Protestant-Catholic vio- lence and hatred. In Belfast, noisy Protestant crowds brandishing British Union Jack flags and placards declaring \No sell- out\ barracked UUP leaders as they arrived for an 800-strong council meeting. A smaller rival demonstrati<Jn shouted their support for the deal, underlining the divisions over conces- sions in the accord made to the Catholic republican Sinn Fein and plans to release jailed guerrillas within two years. But inside the Belfast hotel housing the UUP meeting, delegates gave leader David Trimble a standing ovation after he urged them to back the agreement thrashed out last week following 22 months of negotiations between the eight main Catholic and Protestant parties. UUP delegates were expected to vote later Saturday on whether to endorse or reject the accord. In Dublin, the Irish RepubUc capital, Sinn Fein leaders indicated that a decision on the peace pact was unlikely t{) be made this weekend. \Amongst the Unionists we have massive support,\ UUP deputy leader John Taylor told reporters during a break in proceedings.

His call came as a crisis brewed between Baghdad and the United Nations over U.N. arms inspections in Iraq. A February 23 deal between U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraq defused the crisis and averted a U.S.-British attack on the country. \This is a festival for the people's volunteers, who are ready to confront any aggression America threatens us with,\ an army colonel supervising the marchers told Reuters. \They are civilians from all walks oflife. They are the proof of the unity oflraq. Come, America, see the nigh spirit of the Iraqis even after years of sanctions,\ he added. Koreans Blame Each Other Talks' Collapse BEIJING (Reuters)- Talks between the two rival Koreas on aid to the famine-stricken North collapsed on Saturday with each side faulting each other for the breakdown in their first high-level contact in four years. \South Korea is responsible for the failure to reach agreement because it politicized a humanitarian and . economk issue,\ said Jon Kum -chol, North Korea's chief negotiator. Jon, looking dejected, told a news briefing he was \pessimistic\ about the future of ties with the new South Korean government ofKim Dae-jung because Seoul would not donate fertilizer to the North without strings attached. \The new South Korean administration is using fertilizer as a means of political provocation,\ he said. \Their demands were unreasonably harsh.\ The talks started last Saturday but broke down on Tuesday over Seoul's insistence it would opjy offer aid ifthe North committed itself to a How reunions offamilies divided since the 1950-53 Korean War. Jon 'sSouth Korean counterpart, JeongSe-hyon, told reporters North Korea had unilaterally decided to end talks, calling at midnight to cancel a scheduled reopening of the talks on Saturday morning. He faulted North Korea for-demanding fertilizer aid while rcfus ing to make a firm commitment to di~cmc;tnl\ family reunions and other issues of South Korean concem. The North had proposed the talks to discuss fertilizer aid. \The North kept repeating their stance that the donation of fertilizer would lead to the solution of all other issues, but avoided making any clear commitment to a schedule,\ Jeong told a separate news briefing.

7 7)1Al.O(rUES ON KA c·E.. L l I Opinions Dialogues On Race A Success? The Proof Is In the Pudding \Dialogues On Race a Success?'' J read it myself in this very news- paper, but I couldn't believe it. As I read the headline, I thought, What are these people talking abo11t? These dialogues haven't really accomplished much of anything. Sure, the college desperately needed a forum to talk about race, but has tile forum done any good? Race is without a doubt, the m()st pressing issue at the time in our . country, while it is also one of the most difficult subjects to talk about. Virtually everyone agrees that the final goal should be an environ· ment where we are all treated as equal regardless of skin color, reli- gion, or gender. This is, of course~ where the agreements end. When we talk about solutions to address discrimination, everyone has their own opinion. Just after the opening event, I witnessed an argument between two students. 011e student (calling himself an Ital- ian-American) asserted that understanding and accepting each other's differences is the best way to achieve racial unity. Another student claimed that we should recognize each other as Americans stating that -------------------------------~--~~~___,;:_. nothing can be achieved while we are factional and that \hyphens Concerning Israel's Birthday To the Editor: There was so much about Michele Mosa's letter last week that upset me that I didn'tk11o-w how to respond or where to start. I spent my fall term oflast year in Israel, and am a strong Zionist. Let me start my response by saying that I am sure Ms. Mosa's grandfather was a great and courageous man, and I am als() sure that his life experiences were not easy. It is dangerous though, to use this personal history to substantiate the claims that Ms. Mosa makes. With this said, my first issue is the offense that Ms. Mosa took to Union's celebra1ilJn for .Israel's 50th birthday. First of all, Israel isa nation, and deserves the right to celebrate its birth. Furthermore, if I am not mistaken, Palestinians had/have a holiday to celebrate the formation of the Palestinian A11thority. More importantly though, and perhaps the heart of the issue is that Ms. Mosa took o:f.fe11se to the celebra- tion oflsrael's birthday. This statement suggests a lack of cultural understanding, as well as a lack of respect for Jews, and anyone else who wishes to celebrate Israel's Birthday. The celebrat~on .of Israel is not a political statement, and it certainly will not end up in rock throwing, wllich can't be..,sai.d ofthe attempts to celebrate in Israel. Vassar Arafat won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago. Here is a man that is resp<Jnsible for the deaths of Hundreds oflsraelis and many believe was the mastermind behind theMunich Olyrnpic massacre. Even after winning the prize, he has advocated the use of terrorist tactics. In March of 1997, lle gave the \green light\ for Ham as to resume terror attacks. Even more disturbing, on August 20, 1997, he publicly embraced their leader Abed-ei-Aziz Rantasi, who had said moments before, \I would be proud of my children if one ofthem would carry out a suicide terror attack.\ The fact that Arafat, a man of violence, won the Noble Peace Prize, ·offended and upset me to the bone. How could they hand that prize to a hand that was splattered with the blood of so man,y innocent people? Soon after though, I realized something. You can't shake hands with a clenched fist. Is-rael must recognize the rights of the Palestinians, and the Palestinians must recognize Israel's right to ex.is:t and defend them- selves. If we are going to get anywhere in the Middle East, or in life in ge11eral, we need to have understand- ing and acceptance. Since this letter is getting longer than I expected, I will skip to the part in Ms. Mos;:t' s letter where she states, \I am so tired about hearing theories about why Jews should have and definitely deserve Israel because that is accepting that my family deserved what they got.\ In no way does the acknowledgment of the State of Israel suggested that her family got what it deserved. Just like the creatio11 of the Palestinian Authority does not suggest thatthe thousands of Jews wllo have died atthe hands of Palestinians, including the two gunned down in Hebron this past weekend, got what they deserved. Palestine was meant to be shared by the Jews and Palestinians. It was written in the Balfour cleclaration as well as the U.N. resolution. It was the Arabs who attacked on the day Israel declared its independence, and have been doing so ever since. This is a fact that seems t<J be glossed over. I know that there is violence on both sides, but honestly, if terrorism could really be ended, than peace could realisticaiJy be achieved. This is what the celebration of Israel should be about. It is to celej)rate that the Jews hav-e persevered through the wars and terrorism, but more so, it is a celebration filled with optimism. A celebration filled with hope for peace and understanding. It is to celebrate diversity. Especially at Union, \He need to celebrate diversity. I only hope that Ms. Mosa's letter and my reply can serve as the opening fora healthy discussion about the state of affairs in the Middle East. With a wish of peace, Douglas M. Sclmeider Class of 199& cause wars.\ In my opinion, the first student 'wl'as right. Asking someone to aban- don his or her roots is too much. Wbile it may be easier for people to ca:ll themselves \color blind,\ it isalso insulting. As for Union Col- lege, my biggest concern is that all of us (whites, minorities, students, staff, and faculty) are missing out on valuable life experience. Deal- ing with people different from ourselves in new contexts should be part of everyone's goal, especially that of the admissions office. What makes things more difficultis the nature of racism. It's hard for whites to talk openly about mimorities without sounding ignorant, and it's even harder for people to talk about race withotd a lot of pos- turing. All of us say we know where we stand, but it is our actions on which we should be judged. Yesterday, a friend told me how he saw a couple of black kids being tiarassed by campus security. We can tell each other tllat he should have done something. We can·tell each other what would have hap- pened if we were in his shoes. Unfortunately, we weren't in his shoes, and even more unfortunately, he didn't do something. We can tell each other a hundreod stories about the subtleties of dis- crimination in American society. We can stand up and shout, \This is wrong!\ but when push comes tm ~hove, when the cards are on the table, who will stand up and chan;ge things? If, after the dialogues we've had on campus, you're not screaming at the top of your lungs, \Me! I wjll change!\ then ask yourself, what exactly have we accomplished? l\m not saying that dialogues on race weren't useful. I'm saying that tlley weren't enough. Let's not stop here. Let's find ()Ut why the admissions office isn't accepting more minority students, or why minorities aren't attracted to Union. And when we find out, let's change things. In conclusion, I'm trying to sa)' that it's very easy to forget about issues like race once we've talkoo about it for a while. The discus- sions we've had-over the past week: are not a solution to the diversity issues on campus but rather a step•. So, I urge you: Don't be the aver- age Union college student and d() a half-assedjob. Let's work to- gether here and follow through. We all have something to gain and nothing to lose.

When We Work Together \We shall ovea-c:ome.\ This was the rallying cry of many civil rights workers and demonstrators in the 1960's and remains today as a testa- ment to the tenacity and devotion of many people to the civil rights cause and the rncvement for equality in this country and worldwide. Look at the pl\()noun in this cherished refrain. We. Not \I.\ Not \You.\ Not \They.\ We. 1 'We\ implies a sense of unity and together- ness, a group acting as a whole. On Tuesday, April 7, Dialogues On Race had their &fficial kickoff session. This. event was the beginning of a month-long series of events to open up Union's collective eyes to the race problem we have here on campus and how to deal with it. This session was mainly an opening ceremony of sorts, kicking off a month's worth of events. Beginning April 8 and endimg Aprill6, actual dialogues were held where all mem- bers of the Union community were invited to open discussions held at different locations throughout campus and at different times through- out the day. The hosts of all the dialogues were asked to invite at least· one or two members of the faculty, staff and/or the administration. The majority ofthese dialogues were well attended by the student body and members of the faculty came to a proportionate number of these dialogues.. The administration, however, was hardly visible. According to Pe-er Facilitators members, Dean Williams attended a few and President Hull and one of his assistants went to one as well. Shame on those who didn't. Many studemts have gone out of their way to attend these dialogues to advance racia 1 progress on this campus, but students alone can hardly make any substantive, meaningful changes. We shall overcome. We. Not the student body. Not the faculty. Not the staff. Not the adminis- tration. We, the student body, faculty, and administration shall over- come. In a college stJffering an epidemic of disproportionate representation for minorities, it is nothing short of disgusting for this apathy by those whose job it is to oversee the operations of the college. Although the administration i_s fewer in numbers, their roles are essential and their presence shoulcl have been felt at the dialogues. \Union is aboat as diverse as a WASP/Jew convention, or a 2 Live Crew concert, take your pick\ became a catch phrase for the kickoff to these dialogues. An embarrassing catch phrase, but, nonetheless, a catch phrase. Inmicaliy enough, this quote was cut when it was posted on signs across campus. \Union is abollt as diverse as a WASP/Jew convention, or a 2 Live Crew concert, take your pick. We need mdre of a pro ... active approach by the admission-S committee to recruit minorities\ was tlie lengthier version of the quote. Not to imply any intentional or underhanded deals by the administration, it seems as though this is a metaphor for the first half ()f tile month of Dialogues on Race activities. It calls to p()lint the faults of Union, yet fails to acknowledge the whole problem_ The quote, left for all students and visiting students and parents to s~ee this month bluntly tells the racial environment of the college, yet fails to tell that the administration may be at fault as well. These past tw<l weeks worth of dialogues have had students and facul- ties discussing the problems with race at Union, yet, for the most part, have been dev()id of administrative presence. What a disgrace. According to Peer Facilitators, the faculty and administration will be taking a more visible role in second half of the Dialogues on Race . activities. We ·can only hope for this, and encourage students to take part in these events as well, but it still does not excuse the apathy of the administrationt{)wards the first month's actual dialogues. We shall overcome. We must join together to overcome our racial angsts and stereotypes. Only then can we make progress.

Opinions Yearbook Editor Responds to \Finding Adulth,ood\ $acrificing Union Hi$tory Furtherm()re, I question ilow the administrati(m and student forum My name is Duncan Campbell Crary. I am a sophomore here at Union. This is my twentieth year living in the Capitol District as I am a nt~tive of Albany like my father and my father's father, etc. On my finger I wear my father's Albany Academy ring from 1958 which he had fitted for my finger tenants, willjusthaveto bum their apartments down to feed their families; but as the woman I have never heard ofsaid,.\We've taken Schenectady in consideration.\ For one of the first times in my life, I am actually stumped for words. What can you say when someone tells you that you have not grasped the meaning of an is- sue that you thought was so clear? The idea behind senior superla- tives is not to distinguish those who are better than us; they are merely a way of having fun. They are something to find humor in and laugh at during the ten-year re- union! is justified in giving out prizes for athletics and the student body can- not vote on :similar issues. Further- more, is it()kay for \Greek Week\ to distinguiish certain members of this scho()ll simply because they choose to ~!be greek, whi'le others prefer to be independent? These comparisons are blatantly similar. . when, as a senior at The Albany Academy, I had obtained the same rank of Captain Company Commander that he had achieved thirty-eight years ago. After making the campus 100% residential, the genius master planners proposed to eliminate 12,0()0 square feet of historical residential living space (the Alpha Delta Phi Chapter House) to make an Admissions office with a nicer sitting room for parents while they wait for their child's twenty minute interview to conclude. Nevermind the historical value of Alpha Delta Phi. Nevennind that she was the second fraternity house to be built on this campus, the Mother of All Fraternities, one hundred years ag;o. Nevermind that Alpha Delta Phi is the last original fraternity house still standing and in use by her original organization after one century. Nevermind living I have th<>ught intensely about what makes something superficial and immature, and I have come to the realizati<>n that superficiality is nothing more than mere admira- tion. You see, what makes our senior minds mature is the fact that we can recognize that superficial- ity is okay if we truly understand it. As freshmen, superficiality ex- ists as only seeing the surface level of something and not having the ability to discover what makes something special in a deeper sense. As a sophomore or junior we try our best not to be labeled shallow so we refuse to admit that something can have outer beauty unless there is more to back it up. Yet as seniors, we recognize that superficiality can exist without be- ing the negative stereotype that people portray it to be. We can now identify something as having pure beauty or pure per- sonality. The admiration that we have for people with these traits should not have the negative stan- dards that our mystery writer of last week's editorial points out. We must be kidding ourselves if we consider maturity as not pointing oui interesting qualities in others. Maturity is having the con- fidence in ourselves to be able to distinguish the netable character- istics of otbers. However, as the Editor-in.-Chief of the yearbook I will be first to note that superla- tives were merely a trial and error. Our aim was not to \rehash\ childhood or copy a \high schoolish\ idea. Rather, it was to get seniors involved. If we are ever given negative responses about any of the proposed ideas, we are always happy to omit them, as much a5 we always want new ideas. I vv01uld be happy to receive responses10r ideas at Box #214. In any case, we are creating a fresh book filled with the faces that have affec1ed our past four years. In Gamet we celebrate Union stu- . dents' beau.~tifulindividuality, ath- letic prowess, and exhilarating de- velopment to adulthood. Sincerely, Hannah Blum '98 Editor-In-Chief Gamet Yearbook In Defense of Israel's Fiftieth Birthday After reading Michele Mosa's criticism ofa campus celebration re- garding Israel's fiftieth birthday, I was truly upset. \Vhile I am sin- cerely sorry that her family and many other families have experienced pain from the formation of an Israeli state, I believe that her comments regarding the offensive nature of a celebrati()n are unjust. The formation of Israel is very important to Jewish-American citi- zens due to its representation of religious beliefs. Israel is especially important to the Jewish community because,<> fits representatiC>n of unity after the Holocaust, where six million Jews perished. Furthermore, the formation of Israel as a nation/state shows the per- severance<>fthe Jewish community and it therefore should be celebrated. This celebration is in support ofthese and many other important at- tributes that the creation of Israel gave to tlu: Jewish community and other citizens of the international community. Moreover, this celebration is not affinning Jewish contentment at the fact that Palestinians have lost land and pride. At Union College and in our nation, other celebrations take place that support and represent dif- ferent ethnic/religious communities (i.e. black history month, Hispanic history month, St.Patrick's Day). On my shirt I often wear an Alpha Delta Phi badge my grandfather earned in 1928 when he lived in the very same house that I live in today. The Alpha Delta Phi Chapter house has been a part of my family for seventy- one years; my grandfather called it home, my father spent a good deal of time in the house with my grandfather in the fifties, my mother often visited as a guest of the brothers in the sixties, my sister spent time in the house just a few years ago when her friends from home joined the brotherhood, and now, as a brother myself, I share a room with a distant cousin in the Alpha Delta Phi Chapter House. Sitting in a private meeting held by the Union Administration for the Alpha Delta Phi organization, I heard three people dictate to me the future of the Alpha Delta Phi Chapter House as if their word were law: some woman I had never heard of, a math professor, and a man who dared to claim he was our brother though fully behind the decision to destroy the Alpha Delta Chapter house. Apparently these three minds are the finest Union has to offer-1 was not impressed. In their great plan the master planners made several proposals. Included in these brilliant proposals was a planned invasion of frat houses in Schenectady's most famous neighborhood. Nevermind the value of this world famous Realty Plot, these master planners have no regard for the historical value of good real estate. Next, they proposed to make Union 100% residential, meaning that aU those landlords around campus who depend on Union for History. What's next, housing students in Proctors? Moving the football field to Vale Park? Included in the Master Plan is a proposed wall to encircle the campus. (since the surrounding neighborhood will not be safe due to burned out apartment buildings). But let us not forget what the nice lady said, \We've taken Schenectady m consideration.\ And why will the great organization my family has helped to build over three quarters of a century, be turned into a nice waiting room for strangers who haven't paid a dime to this school? Because as the Math Professor told us, \It just jumped out at us.\ (Maybe that is mathematical lingo I'm not familiar with). The house just jumped out at them and since the school has the power to do so, Union will destroy her own rich history. And mark this, once Alpha Delta Pili is gone, it's all over- Welcome to the new millennium. I thought it was quite amusing to hear Dean Alford point to us Alpha Delts in the crowd and accuse Alpha Delta Phi of allowing our home to go down the same road as Delta PhL Apparently there are some who believe our house to be in poor upkeep even though she is perfectly sound.

There was no upkeep of the famous memorial until the entire building was destroyed by neglect. But because AD needs more paint on the outside we must take it over and destroy it?

And all have seen in twenty years is outsiders come to my home and destroy its rich culture in order to foolishly build parking lots or Mini malls. There is little left in this area, not because GE pulled out-I'm sick of hearing about GE--but because bloodthirsty outsiders see the opportunity to ruin a small little city in order to make a buck.

S~i.cnc~ §c. T~chnology $ Technology $ Out With the Old and In With the New by Jeffrey Ausfield Staff Writer The new wave of CDs is not DVD disks. A new standard will be sweeping the industry in the· near future. The new standard is called Nano-'CD. The name de- scribes the size of this new and exciting technology. It is aboutthe size of a penny and can hold 800 times the amount of information of a conventional CD, a total 400 gigabytes. On this Nano-CD you would be able to store every bit of informa- tion that you have ever had and still have room left over for a fun- length movie. Stephen Chou, an Electrical Engineering professor at the University of Minnesota, de- veloped the technology that is 100 times denser than the best DVDs on the market. How does it work? The Nano- CD works in a way that is com- pletely new from the lasers used to interpret the conventional COs. The Nano-CD is a :polymer-based mold that has pits on the surface. These pits are 10 nano-meters long and are spaced 40 nano-meters apart from each other. The device that replaces the laser in CD tech- nology is. a silicon needle. The Nano-CD is spun around like a normal CD but much slower and as the silicon needle becomes close to the Nano- CD's surface it vibrates. The vibration is caused by atomic interactions between the silicon needle and the disk's sur- face. These vibrations allow the computer to \map\ the entire sur- face of the Nano-CD and, essen- HOURS: tially, extract data from it. To change to this type of technology, a whole new player needs to be designed. A plan for a new voice activated device is in the works and the outlook is positive. ls the new technology going to . catch on like the CD and the soon · to be DVD? The answer is prob- ably no. This new technology will eventually take over the market but not \in its present form. The first thing that needs changing is the fact that it would need to be rewritable and that the normal computer user must be able to make it himself. Its current design does not allow for either of these things to happen. This technology is a spring board for a new era of multime- dia, and let me tell you: the future looks pretty cool.

-·· ... Page Lost In Space In the distant future the fate of mankind lies in the hands of one family. Charged with the survival of the human race, the Robinson family embarks on a heroic journey across the galaxy. When disaster .strikes, however, they find them- selves hurtling through time and space. Lost in the depths of the uncharted universe, the Robinsons must come together and use their unique skills to over- come their fears and find a way home. Every good planet has its ups and downs. Unfortunately for the human race, the futuristic setting of Lost in Space reveals an Earth depleted of natural resources and destroying its ozone layer. The government has searched the galaxy for plan~ts capable of sustaining human life, and have fi- nally found a planet suitable for colonizatien_: The only drawback is that tile planet happens to be ten years away by conventional space travel. In a desperate attempt to save man- kind, the government begins con- struction on a massive jumpgate that will allow ships to travel di- In celebration <>f the fine art of dining out, we have decided te> devote a section of the fabulous A&E section to restaurant reviews. Each week, a new restaurant from the Schenectady/Albany area will be critiqued for your dining plea- sure. This week, my colleagues and I ventured out to Scotti's Restaurant and Pizzeria. This quaint ab<lde is located on 1730 Union Street ill Schenectady. For you history lo\- ers, I should mention that Joe Scotti first established the restaurant in 1968. Our buddy Joe owned the res- taurant until 1985 when one ofhis employees bought the restaurant from him. In 1994, Guy Sementelli, the current owner, took the busi- ness over. Kimberly Rohback '0() met Sementelli and she felt \he was a charming and personable man.\ After speaking to Sementelli, our dining adventure finally began. Before I get to the food, I feel it ls essential to set the mood. Scotti's can be described as hav i'lg a mod· est, yet impressive, at .1osphere. rectly fmrn earth to the planet (a Ia Stargate). Yet as we all know, traveling through hyperspace is never as easy as it may first appear. It turns out that unless a gate is also con- stn.icted at the destination plallet, a ship e11tering hyperspace will have no control over where it ends up. Enter tile Robinson Family. Pro~ fessor John Robinson (Wil1iam Hurt) and his family have been se- lected to make the ten year voyage and oversee construction of the second gate. Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc) is assigned to pilot their state-of-the-art spacecraft the Jupiter Two across the cosmos. A rival faction on Earth caiJed the Sedition, however, also has their eyes set on this planet. In an attempt to stop the govemmetlt's colonization mission, they enlist Dr. Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the Jupiter Two and kill the Robinson family. In a twist of fate, Smith becomes trapped on the spaceship after sabotaging it. As the Jupiter Two plunges out of control, Professor Robinson is forced to activate the hyperdrive without the use of a gate. As the ship comes out of room while Italian music plays in the background. We started off our meal with drinks and shrimp cocktail. Both were wonderful. Then our lovely waitress brought out some delight- ful salads. I must say that the Jlep- percom parmigiana dressing was delicious. Finally, the main course arrived. I ordered the chicken parmigiana with a side order of ziti. It was de- lightful! Tlle chicken was tender, the cheese was at a perfect cons is- tency, and the sauce had a flavor- ful and fun zing to it. My dining partners ordered baked ziti and spinach ravioli. Rohback commented on her ravioli and she felt, \it was the best I have ever tasted.\ Doug Dakin '98 said, \Ifi was stuck on an alJan- doned island, and I could only eat one type of food, I would pick Scotti's e>wn baked ziti.\ The meal was great, though a little pricey.· A meal for four cost about $55, not including tip. The portions were abundant and hyperspace, the entire audience is shocked to learn that in a sudden plot twist the Robinson family has indeed become ... lost in space. Director Stephen Hopkins (The Ghost ami the Darkness) has transformed this 1960's Park. Many ofthe scenes were loud and visually stunning, making for quite an entertaining time. The aliens, ships, and planets they discover have certainly raised the expectations for future science fiction films. With actors like Oldman (The Professional, Fifth Element, Air Forc?One)andHurt(Smoke, Dark City)at t h e he I m, t h i s movie seemed· d e s - tined f o r s u c - cess. LeB~ in a de- parture from his role on tbe sitcom Friends (Joey Trebbiani), also holds his own as Major Don West. In be- tween saving the Robinsons from countless perils, West has time to pursue the lovely Judy Robinson played by Heather Graham (Twin Peaks, Boogie Nights). \\' Unfortunately, superb special effects and.anex~llen.tcast ar~ aU. Lost in Space has going for it. The film boasts being faithful to the characters and premise ofthe origi- nal TV series while adding a con- temporary plot and modem spe- cial effects. Therein lies the prob- lem with this film. the service was efficiently pleas- ant. Average prices for entrees range from $7.50-18.95, but subs are also available for $3.95-5.75. Oh, by the way, no smoking is al- lowed. For those of you who agorapho- bic, Scotti's has takeaout service. So have no fear, you can send a friend to pick up some fine cuisine for you. A large pizza costs a mere $8.50! Thinking about having a bomb celebration? Catering from Scotti's is avail- able! For information about these fme services, call393-7440. Scotti's is open for dinner Tuesday-Satur- day from 4:30PM-9:30PM and on Sundays from 4:00 PM-9:00 PM I am pleased to say that Scotti's deserves two thumbs up from me. Everyone should try to get there at least once before they graduate from our fine institution of academia. I suppose this is alii have to say for this week. Stay tuned for an- other gr<lovy review next week. If you have any dining suggestions, feel free to recommend them to me. While we have never actl:lally seen the TV show, vve have heard that it was very «campy\ and the best thing about it was the talking robot. Unfortunately; this film tries to combine this \campy\ atmo- sphere with the action and inten- sity of a 90's science fiction block- buster. The result is a disjointed and somewhat ridiculous seeming story line. There is a .place for fam- ily values and a place for fighting terrifying space creatures. It is definitely possible for the two to be cambined in a rewarding adventure film, but Lost in Space falls short of this mark. It just tling flesh-eating aliens, and crash- ing into a desolate planet in an un- known galaxy that Mrs. Robinson would turn to Mr. Robinson and say, \I think you should be spend- ing more quality time with our son.\ This attempt at family bonding permeates the entire film and seems very misplaced. When they are fighting aliens with loud music and incredible special effects, we really don't need to stop and dis- cuss their true feelings for each other. This is not to say we don't en~ joy drama, we liked Titanic and Good Will Hunting just as much as everyone else. In this :film, how- ·ever, the family aspect was rather forced and merely served to break up the rest of the story. Penny Robinson, played by Lacey Chabert (Party of Five), ex.empli- fies this notion as she is cast as the quintessential daughter revolt- ing against l1er parents while deal- ing with the issues of being a teen- ager. Seriously, who wants to worry about getting eaten alive by aliens <lr dying in space when you can constantly complain about things like leaving your friends and never kissing boys? This film seemed like we were stuck in some strange amusement park where at one moment we are <m the roller coaster and having the time of our lives, and then sud- denly we find ourselves. While the special effects and several out- standing scenes made this movie fun, the story left much to be de- sired with far too many annoying lines. It is hard to imagine exactly what audience this film is aimed at. I don't exactly see why there were so many pointless sex scenes. Viewers of the old TV show will find it too serious and action- packed, while younger generations will most likely feel it was too \campy.\ As one might expect, this film leaves itself wide open for any number of sequels. We wouldn't be surprised ifwe see in a couple of years Lost In Space 2: Will Hits Puberty and Penny Breaks a Nail. Due to its special effects, our rating is artificially high. However, on video special effects are less enjoyable and im- pressive. Oltr Rating: Rent It. Arts~ ( We Union ( tureto5 munity ~ tion of cible.

We Liked the Costumes (but not much else) ••• by Lori Greene A&E Editor We decided to abandon our Union College snobbery and ven- ture to Schenectady County Com- munity C()llege to see their produc- tion of Arthur Miller's The .Cru- cible. Since we're sick of the nega~ tivity Mike Winn brings to our sec- tion; we are going to list what we did enjoy about the production. Well, after much thought, we came up with a short, but none the less impressl\le 'list. 1. We g{)t in for free! No,. our editor status did not allow us free admissio11; ittook some cleverly- ing. While waiting outside for Kim to smoke a cigarette before the pro- duction, we met a lovely girl who informed us that general admission was three dollars, but it was free for sec ~tudents. S~e also told us that they were not checking schooli.D. With that informati()n, we held our heads high and pronounced ourselves sec students to the kind woman at the ticket booth. With that, we went to find our seats, bringing us to posi- tive point number 2. 2. Plenty ofleg room! Whatthe theatre may lack in charm and class, it makes up for in roomy seats. We were able to stretch out and had plenty of elbow space, which was good as we were going to be there for a while! 3. Hysterical programs. Wbile waiting for the show to begin{ ten minutes late) we perused our .ptro- grams, all twenty pages worth.lle- tween ads for the local Stewut''s Shops and \break a leg\ n()tes from parents, we found entertain- ment in the cast and crew bio~ra­ phies. We'd like to share excerpts fr'()m our favorites .. Names have been changed to prevent embamtss- ment. *John Doe (Giles Corey) really digs old people .. He would like to thank Charity for suggesting he thank someone. *Jill Spot (Tituba) She will be graduating in May(be)with aE:Iu- manities degree~ Oh what a joy()u~ day it will be for her. *Scott Brown (Deputy Governm Danforth) In his spare time Scott enjoys computers, video games, and reading science fiction e111d fantasy _books. Now, imagine this contimalog for a cast and crew of over thirty people! It was entertaining, Ill- though Kim and I found ourse[ ves to be the only ones laughing!' 4. The pre-show. So, as the ligllts went down, we realized not ()n]y was there no set but the lighting was pretty minimal. Now the sb()W would begin, but no ... first, the \Student Public Relations Di pily,\ so we were not permitted to take ''God's Favorite'' to Pound the Audience into a Lot of Laughs by Kimberly Robback A&E Editot This tenn, one ambitious yo-uth, Mike Winn, dragged his sorry a-s to one of the weekly Mountebanks meetings, open to everyone, yet usually attended by the five faith- ful members of the executive board. The discussion for that week was \Wbat are we going to do this tenn for Student Theater?\ Later that weekend Winn and I poured through several Neil Simon scripts looking for the perfect physical comedy that Union has been long- ing for since the days of \Noises Off.\ The play that was decided on was Neil Simon's \God's Favorite.\ A hysterical sctipt, with colorful characters and a lot of destruction. The script evolves around a fam- ily, where the father, Joe, is all ex- tremely pious man with a lot of money. Late one night, the family is awaken,ed by the sounds of an in- truder in their luxurious home. The intruder turns out to be Sidney Lipton, a messenger from God. Lipt()n explains to Joe that God made a bet with Satan that Joe would be the one human on earth not to renounce him despite the devil' s torture. The family loses their house,. tile family business; Joe loses llis health a:nd he is afflicted with ~e v- era! unc.om fortable diseases, bLJt be refuses to renounce God. You vrill have to come see the show t() s:ee how the story ends. ~ The next step in the prod uc ti.()n process was to pick a director and a stellar cast. Doug Schneider was chosen to direct the piece dtte to his directorial aspirations ancj tlis love ofNeil Simon. The cast in- cludes Joe, the father (John foor '98), them other(Am y Rilling ~9 S), the older son, (Mike Winn 'O()),.the twins, (Adrian MacLean '98 ~tnd Keith Hamilton '98), Sidney Lipton (Jon Zandman '99), and the do111 es- tics (Sandy Rodrigues '00 and fiori Leo '00).

The show will be performed M a.y 15 1 h and 16 1 \ in the actor's stwEioof the Yulman Theater. ltpromise::sto be a knee-slapping comedy, p~cked with a stellar cast and a fahul()llS script. Mark your calendars. no.w, this is one show you do not want tom iss. pictures. 5. You'd probably like to hear about the acting, but we are only mentioning positive things, so that's out. Although, there were two redeeming actors. Alex Bruce, a second year student played one of the lead characters, John Proc- tor. He did this with grace and was making some excellent choices on stage. The other standout performance was his wife Elizabeth, played by Charity Brokaw. She is a first year student who \hates to wear _wigs.\?? Her performance was compelling and a welcome treat compared to the wretched acting by the rest of the ensemble. 6. And the costumes. Ti1e pe- riod costumes, which took a cos- tume crew of eleven people to con- struct, were tremendous, save the Chinese sUppers worn by the women. We hope the men were wearing wigs, as each had long, curly hair and matching beards. 7. The ending. For us, it came at intermission. Now, I am not promot- ing early escapes from theatre, even terrible theatre, but we had to. For me, it was a form of self-de- fense, as Kim would have killed me if I made her stay any longer. We had no hope of it getting any bet- ter, and since we had both seen the show before, we slipped out the back door, in awe of what we had just seen on stage. · TODAY!

Baseball Moving PaSt .. 500 by David Weiner Sportr; Writer After an auspicious start to what .appeared to be a woeful season, the Swinging Dutchmen have res- urrected themselves and improved their record to twelve wins and eleven losses. After a lackluster performance in Florida where the team posted a mere two wins coupled with seven losses, the Dutclunen have· been on a role, winning ten of their last fourteen games to finally bring their record above .500. Withjust less than two weeks remaining in their regular season, Union must continue on their recenttrendofsuccess if they are to reach post-season play. This past week was an eventful one for the Dutchmen as they played six games. emerging victo- rious in all but ()ne of those six. Union was able to take both ends of doubleheaders from Hartwick and RIT as well as beating the Uni- versity of Rochester in the first of their two games (the second was cancelled due to rain). The only loss of the week for Union was a disappointing performance against SUNY Albany, which will go to Division II next year. Hartwick The swinging Dutchmen opened their week of battle with a sweep of Hartwick College, win- ning the first game 4-0 and the sec- <lnd 3-2. Behind tile solid pitching wmbination of freshman Dave Pennacchia and senior Captain Dave Kline who IJOSted a three hit shutout, Union had no trouble de- feating Hartwick. Providing the run support for Penmtcchia and Kline was Jeremy Pflaum who drove in two runs with two singles. The second victory of this <loubleheader did not come in as easy a fashion as the first. Ryan Almstead took t() the mound for this game, pitching a complete game, allowing just five hits and two runs. Union's offense was once again provided by Pflaum who doubled, Ryan Smith who also doubled, and 'Todd Ellis who singled, driving i11 the necessary ru11s to defeat Hartwick and im- pr<lve Union's record to nine wins and ten losses. Albany Ryan Smith scoring the run This game unfortunately did not go as smoothly as the previous two. After five innings, Union found themselves in a six run hole, as poor defense and a lack of of- fense troubled the Dutchmen. However, on the power of a Dave Poindexter double, Union battled back to within one in the top half of the sixth inning before allowing Albany to put the game away with four runs oftheir own in the bot- tom half of that inning. Along with Poindexter, Jeremy Lamb put to- gether a solid offensive day as he posted two hits, drove in a run, and scored. RIT Union's second doubleheader of the week treated them well as they were able to defeat RIT twice, both one run decisions. Senior Captain Josh Soldo pitched a complete game, allowing just four runs on nine hits. Brett Zani crossed the plate to provide the fifth and deciding run in the eighth inning after the RIT pitcher committed a balk. Zach King, normally a defensive stal- wart, had an incredible offensive day going 3~4 with two runs bat- ted in. Aaron BrauJlsjtein/ Ryan Smith being congrCJtulated by teammates after scoring the go-ahead run against RIT home on a squeeze play in the bot- tom oftlle ninth inning oftlle sec- ond game to plate the winnb1g run. Junior Craig Kazmierczak _;got the start on the mound and pitclled su- perbly before giving duties '()Ver to closer Dave Kline who recorded his first win of the season. Along with King, Josh Durepo had himself a stellar secon<lgame, hitting a double and a triple; scor- ing two mns, and driving in one. Rochester While these teams were sched- barely allowed the first game to be com.pleted. Union held on in this game, however, as they defeated Rocl1ester 7-6. Ryan Smith began the sixth in- ning of a tie game with a double, and tllen scored the go ahead run. Lami>' drove in two runs as he blasted a double, and Ellis posted a double in the third inning as well. King continued his successful uled to square off for two games, day as he bunted Brian Gould the inconsistent New York weather Witl1 a 7-6 lead going in to the seventh inning, the pitching duties were once again handed to Kline who pitched effectively and re- corded his fifth save of the sea- son. Dutchmen Vie for Beast of The East Title by Heath Levine Contributi11g Writer The Union C<lllege Men's Rugby Team ve11tured down to beautiful Barringt()n, Rhode Island on Saturday for the 1998 Beast of the East Collegiate Tournament. Tile boys were representing one of the smallest schools in a tour- nament which included big name schools such as Boston Univer- sity, Yale, Umass, and many oth- ers. Led by captains Pike \I'm big- ger, quicker and faster then you\ Mody and Brian \Kick the ball till you can't kick it anymore\ Field, tbe team set out t<> Win its first game at this tournament evert The first opponent for the young and excited squad was the University of Maine at Farmi11gton. Union took an early lead wben Field, who has scored over 90% of the teams points in the last couple of games, converted a penalty kick for an easy three points. Farmington also convet1ed a pen- alty kick in the hard fought, but sloppy first llalf. The second half started off poorly for the Union boys as Farmington took the ball to the weak side offthe first serum of the half and took a I 0-3 lead. Union fell short of the try zone by a couple of meters, as Fred \Puffy\ Gibney and Nick \Nicholas is more proper\ Campbell moved the ball nicely but failed to convert. Be- hind the push of Farmington's prop, who appeared to be Coach Tom Milner's long-lost twin, the University of Maine pushed down the field and with a try and one more penalty kick made the score 18-0. Of course the Dutchmen did not give up and Field took the ball from a lineout,. and ran tbrougll many Farmington players to bring the score to 18-10, where it re- mained for the rest of the game. After a six hour break and a tra- ditional luncll at the Newport Creamery, the only diner in Barrington, Union was psyched to play in the consolation g;ame against Roger William's University. Still searching for the team ~s first win in Rhode Island, the teaJl:lmade some changes in the linellp for game two. Big Pete Cosola,. Chris Frazier, andChris Vietorcrune in to help the Pack, and John ''r!L stop a Mack Truck with my head\¥ arkoni stepped in at fullback to help the line. Once again Field conveliedan early penalty kick to take a 3-~ lead over Roger Williams. Dutcltmen defenders, Steve \In the army now\ Flaherty a~d Seth \T'W() by four'' Potkin played tough, c!llming up with some key tackles. How- ever at the end of the first half Union trailed 14-3. In the second half,. Union hoped to utilize the· speed of\The catch me if you can brothers,\ Heath Levine and Nemo Bolin-Gamsby. Levinetooktheball into 1be try-zone after some nifty passing between fellow midget Gamsby, and the not-too-lean Mody. Soon after, Gamsby again got llold of the ball and outran four Roger Williams players for a try of his own, giving Union a 15-l4lead. The. Dutchmen fought hard to keep the lead, but a late penalty kick by the ()pponents was enough to hand Union their second loss ofthe day. Overall the tournament was a good teaming experience for the young Dutchmen, who are looking for- ward tothis weekend'stoumament, for tile Upstate New York Champi- onship. ..

First year head coach Peter Brown has got to be pleased with his team's strong performance as they are onlyonegameaway from doubling last year's total wins of eight. Said Pickering, \We played re- ally well on Saturday. Utica s pitch- ing struggled, but we did not com- mit any errors, which had been a problem in the past.\ Two weeks ago, Union committed a number of errors against Hartwick which lead to twelve un-earned runs and a 12- 4 loss. If Union's defense contin- ues to play as well as they did on Saturday, they are going to be a tough team to beat. Union hosted RPI on Tuesday, travels to New Paltz today, and hosts Skidmore on Saturday. With only four games remaining after Skidmore, the six games this week are going to be very important games. Going into last Saturday's game, Union was ranked 12th in the State. The top eight teams will head to the New York State Playoffs. However, after two wins last Sat- urday, Union is sure to move up a few spots, making this week's games crucial in order to continue into the post season. The Dutchwomen host Skidmore for a double header on Saturday starting at I :00 PM. The game will played at Alexander Field. Come support the swinging Dutch women.

Renn commented tbat \the captains de- cided that the team needed to bond outside ofUnion .... [We] watched Bad NewsBears prior to sleeping, those who slept, and two days later we finished third in the state cham- pionships which was the best women's finisn ever.\ In addition to playing soccer at Union, Renn has been a valuable contributor to the track team as well. Renn has competed for the outdoor track team for two seasons nominated to be presented at the Steinmetz symposium. Despite not being at Union this spring to compete for her third straight year on the track team, Renn has certainly been a valuable contributor to the two teams she did have the opportunity to com- pete on this year. It is perhaps appropriate that the arts admirer istraveling to Italy this term, the home for some of the great painters and sculptors of all- time.

They have won four in a row, and seem to have gotten control of their game, and are now threat- ening the UCAA with a powerful assault. Not only has their season record improved, but their confer- ence record is a very promising 3- 1. The momentum does not .stop here, the team has outscored its last three opponents 58 to 12.

Using the momentum from their overtime victory against rival lUI, the Dutchwomen attacked On~onta, Clarkson, and St. Lawrence. The first victim of their streak was Oneonta, losing 20-4. In this contest, the Dutchwomen wasted little time pulling ahead in the first halfto a 9-2Jead. Leading . the pack on scoring were Shako Okado with five, and LizKittleman with four. Also contributing were · Merriam and Lauren ·Pastor with . three each. Maura Woessner bad another great game stopping 15 shots on goal. The Dutchwomen then had a three day \rest\ before their 11:ext game against Clarkson. I am sure by no means, was it a rest from practice, by the performance of this team. Speaking with Coach Linda Bevelander, she was exhila- rated with her teams perfo1111ance. \Our passing, catching, and off the ball movement was strong. We pass knowing that a teammate is going to be there to catch the ball.\ Bevelander stated. Moving on to this past weekend, the Dutchwomen faced Clarkson and St. Lawrence at home. They look advantage of this and showed off their ski-lls to the home crowd. Union put on quite a display in these two games eliciting their coach to be lost for words or emo- tion. When asked about her week, the Coach wasted no time, giving credit to her team. \Well the week was absolutely superb or shall I say that the women's lax team is absolutely phenomenal.\ Coach Bevelander responded. The Dutch women again wasted no time with Clarkson, working up to a 14-1 lead at half time. Out- standing play came from Lauren Pastor who scored five goals, Liz Kittleman with four goals, and Abby Harris with four as well. As the offense, worked the ball around, it gave Woessner some time off. Through strong defensive play, and great offensive control, Woessner only had to make four saves.

This race hosted by Skidmore Col- lege is different from the other races earlier on in the season as more than two colleges are invited race. Some of the crews present in addition to Union and Skidmore were RPI, Al- bany, Vassar, and Russell Sage. This becomes the most important race for Union eve!)' year leading up to States because it creates a device for the coaches, to measure how the boats have improved over the course of two weeks, since home opener against RPI. Depen- dent on the results <Jfthis race, the coaches generally build the last two weeks ofpractic~ around spe- cific areas of improvement, as the squads gear up f()r States. In the first race ofthe day, the men's varsity eigbt prepared to do battle against nemesis RPI and home course favorite Skidmore. From the start the race intensity was high. Union looked to get back at RPI for the loss two weeks prior while also looking to beat u:p on Skidmore who has been victori- ous over Union for many conse()u- tive years. Union men presse<l <Jut of the gate and took a full b()at length lead over RPI by the I ()00- meter mark while Skidmore bung tight only half a boat lengtli be- hind. RPI feelingthe pressure was on them made a tremendous move to pull even in the middle 500meters of the race. RPI and Union went back and forth throughout as Skidmore faded out of the race; but, history repeated itself and R.PJ's experience was able to pull out a second win against Union. In the women's varsity eight race the crews included Albany, RPI, Skidmore, and Union. Skidmore broke off the line quickly as they built a one half-length lead over Union. By the end ofthe ftrst 1 000 meters Skidmore had stretched the lead to a full boat length as AlDany and RPI faded out of .the pi-cture. Union hung tough throughout, ~s they would not let Skidmore! ron away with the lead. With 300 meters to go Skidmore stretc:lted the lead another two seats in the sprint to finish with a win. Union rowed very we-n and hard. They were also able to reach many of the goals set for the race such as higher stroke ratings. Sue Zelnick said that, ''The race went well, but ·there is stili room for improvement. Zein ick also stated that, \the women need to come together more during the race and make more sig- nificant moves.\ The entire women's varsity is looking forward to racing Skidmore again at States. In the men's and women' sjunior varsity boats large improvements were seen. On the men's side Union faced RPI, Skidmore, and Albany. Skidmore and their strong junior varsity took off from the start and never looked back as tll)·ey won easily but a good race remained with the other three crews. Albany pressed from the beginning taking 2\d and holding it over 3'd place Union and 4th RPI through the first 1000 meters. Then Union and RPI began to move. RPI pulled into 2rod as Union held close to them and AJbany faded away to finish in 411>. Union facing tough water in the last 600 meters·ofthe race fell back from RPI but were able to finish strong and shrink the deft cit between them and RPI by over half, from two wee:ks 1 prior. The JV men improved trennendously and are looking for- wartd to States as RPI and Skidmore b<>thha<l varsi~ rowers in their JV b()ats and will be weaker facing a m()re i1nproved Union boat. 111 t:he women's JV boat the im- Pf()';!~ment was ten fold as they sh()~.Ned Russell Sage how much they- really improved in two weeks.

In a multiple collision rac-e where the boats came too cl()se together the Union women came just snort of upsetting Skidmore. With less tlian 250 meter to go Union made their last charge but as they were quickly taking seats and looked as though they were going to pull off the upset the last of four C()Jlisions occurred stopping Union momen- tarily. It was just enough to a11ow Skidmore to win. Union's novice eight has its sights on States and looks forward to meeting Skidmore again.

'f s r Sp6rts· ccLet:'s J: ~<>~ TalkAbo1.It: It:~' by Brian TerJinsk:y Staff Writer Frustration and confusing is being felt, as this was yet another disappointing week for the men's lacrosse team here at Union. After arriving home on Saturday from. their week- end away, the most common phrases said when asked about their games was either, \no comment\ or \lets not talk about it.\ Union was once again wiped out this week, losing to Springfield College at home on Tuesday, and then falling to both Clarkson and St. Lawrence Universities over the week- end. These three defeats extend Union's los- ing streak to six, as they head for the last stretch ofthis season having a record of 2- 8. The team has been totally outscored, giv- ing up 133 goals, while only scoring 36 in these past defeats. Before lleading up state this weekend, the team got word that three key players de- cided to tllm in their jerseys early this sea- son for personal reasons. Seniormid-fielder Sunil Schneider, who is known for his speed and great stick handling skills, as well as long polemic!-fielder junior Jas~n Cyboron and sophomore mid-fielder Scott Halla, all are talented players and will be missed by the team. Th.e loss of these players will now put more pressure on the younger players, n Braunstein A Union mid-fielder attacks the ball against a Springfield defensemen. especially the freshmen, to step-it up for the team during the rest of the season. On a sunny spring Tuesday afternoon, Union faced-off to Springfield College and was defeated by the score of 15-5. Although Union fired 33 shots on goal, it would not be enough, as Springfield was too powerful for the Union offense and defense. Tallying the five goals for Union was attack-man senior Doug Gahagan and sophomore Owen Hays. Mid-fielder seniors Chad Kimball and Mike Frattarola and freshman Tom Kirby also re- Don:'t just hit the beach, hie rhc books this summer and you'll be on your way to an easier fall semester, an cady- gradll<ltion, or a head start on your graduate degree!

Senior goaltender Grant Pollock made 32 tough saves. Union had a couple of days to recover, before embarking on their weekend trip to Clarkson and St. Lawrence. But it was not enough time, as Union would get blown-out by both teams. During Friday'sgarneagainst Clarkson, Union had control of the .ground ball game, and put 24 shots on goal. But Clarkson's experienced and skilled attack- men helped lead their team to victory, by the score of I 8-8, as Union goaltender Grant Pol- lack faced 39 shots. Despite the loss, reach- ing the scoreboard for Union was freshmen attack-men Scott Dutcher, with four goals and Nick Balascio, who registered two. Also contributing to Union's score was junior mid-fielder Tim Benson, as well as senior mid-fielder Chris Delano, who had two goals and two assists. Saturday's game against St. Lawrence was even more depressing, as Union fell by the score of 23-6. Both teams had an even amount of shots on goal with 41 for Union and 42 for St. Lawrence. Freshman Scott Dutcher scored one, out of his 12 shots on goal. Additional players to score were se- niors Doug Gahagan, Chris Delano Chad Kimball, who had two, and junior Chad Schneider. Freshman Scott Dutcher, who continues leading Union in total points, feels the team can be successful, only ifthey play together and with heart. \It won't be until \\'C pia) will full force in four quarters, ~ .. ill\\ c com~ together and win.\ Coach McCormack is proud of his team so far and believes it will take some time for this young team to come together. \We are working hard, but we will eventually get there,\ coach said. Union's next game will be home against Trinity on Saturday at 2 PM. Complete re- cap from that game will be in nex:t week's issue. Women's Lacrosse Continued from page 19 against Colby, was well made up for. Not only that, but the pace was much more in- tense, and it never got old watching Union work the ball around, and then putting one at the back ofthe·net. The Dutch women then faced off against St. Lawrence, bombarding them with an of- fensive onslaught. The Dutchwomen eas- ily were the better team, outshooting the Saints 29-12. This game held the same theme as the Clarkson game, with Union keeping pressure in their offensive zone, and giving Woesnner yet another slow game. Liz Kittleman kept her streak alive adding four more goals, leading the Dutchwomen to a 17-6 victory. Contributions also came from Lauren Pastor and Merriam, each with three. Putting the weekend behind them, and moving on, the Dutchwomen had one day to prepare for Siena on Tuesday. By the looks of things, the Dutchwornen are not done yet. According to the team, they still must remain focused in order to beat Spring- field, Rochester, and Hamilton. Even t11ough, these may be tough competition, they fell strong enough to finish the season, with at least three more victories. Available for comment was Sopllomore Katie Hayes, who feels very confident in her teams capability. \We seem to be play- ing up to our potential and working as a team. We have improved since the start of the season, and feel we have the potential to be a threat in State competition.\ Hayes stated. .....

Page 22 • April 23, 1998 • C!lnncnx~i~m\i!Si Sports A Fan's Draft Day Delusions by Christopher G. Lecme Editor-in-CIIief I worked hard all year long. It was a must t() be ,in shape for this past Saturday and tile NFL Draft. I had the media guides for my favorite teams, the rosters were all memo- rized, possible June 1st salary cap cuts were taken into account, and the pre-draft guides were all read cover-to-cover. I was set to go at noon and ESPN did not disappoint with solid coverage. For local football fans the draft is better than the Super Bowl. It is the one day a year when the teams are not judged by on the field play and for the past eight years this has been a nice relief for Jets fans. While the Jets were not active in the first round, plenty of interesting themes worked their way through the draft for the ,cross town Giants. In the week leading up to the draft it was reported that the Giants wanted a wide re- ceiver to help an anemic offense. It was argued that Randy Moss, the talented crim i- nal fi'om Marshal) University, would not last that long and was to risque for the gentle giants. Supposedly, the Giants had Utah's Kevin Dyson, on their wish list and were willing to trade up to get their man. Once again that was not the case when the Gi- ants stayed at 24 and made their pick. What was proven by the time the Giants picked was that most analysts did not have a clue as the G-men chose a safety named Shaun Williams from UCLA. Williams will be a nice fit into the Giants nickle packages If someone were to ask a person what they think about when they hear the words, \Bos- ton, Massachusetts\ the response will un- doubtedly be, \Fenway Park, Boston Gar- den, Head of the Charles, the Boston Mara- thon, and more.\ These responses, if you notice, are all sports events or venues. Now, I am not saying that Boston is solely a sports town, but sports, somehow, do have a way of consuming such a historic city. Take, for example, 1986, when the Red Sox reached the World Series. While the team, unfortunately could not find as much luck as the New York Mets that year, the way the city rallied around their team, and then was so dejected at the outcome. There are very few cities where the people live and die by the success of their sports teams. Boston, however, is most definitely one of these and a great player that no one person be- lieved would be available to the Giants. Of co11rse all the fans loved thepick and praised the Giants new general manager Ernie Acorsi for taking the best player available, even if it made all the prognosticators look like fools. In the second and third rounds the Giants took two wide outs, one from Penn State named Joe Jurevicius, and another from Per- due named Brian A !ford. While it is too early to tell if these two receivers will be the next coming, the prognosticators were right so it was another reason to sing praise. Take a look at your team roster. If they are contenders it is more than likelythatthe team is composed of a good number of solid middle round draft picks. if your 1eam is a pretender, the roster should look quite dif- ferent. The Dallas Cowboys are the perfect example ofthistheory. Once Jimmy Johnson left Dallas, the middle round picks suffered towns. Growing up near Boston, I too became one of the crazed sports fans th.at clutter the city. I still jump at the opportunity to see the Green Monste.- and often arrange my sum- mers around attending Red Sox games. With spdng upon us, I cannot help but think back to my childhood days when my father would takerne, year after year, to watch the likes of Dwight Evans, Jim Rice, Marty Barrett, and now even Mo Vaughn or Nomar Garciaparra. There is nothing like watching a game at Fen way Park. The Boston Marathon is another ofthose time-honored traditions that everyone looks forward to. Just recently this event cel- ebrated its one-hundredth anniversary. The notion that people from around the world convene in Boston to compete for the title and the team b.as struggled wh-ile Johns()n and the Miami Dolphjns have built a stalJie team on middle roundta.Jent. What is to be taken from the past draft is simple, For a <lay it is nice to imagine a pick leading your fa:vorite team to a champion- Ship. What is 111()re realistic is for the pick: to develop into a solid player. There will be injur.ies to some players, off the field prob- lems f()r others, but in the end, luck will pre- vail. Good first round picks mean nothing if they do not perform on the field. The lesson leamedfrom all drafts, regard- Jess of the spcrt, is that you have a better chance picking a winner from a three card monty hustler than you do of guaranteeing a future superstar t<> a certain team. *'***'* The Yankees are rolling along despite mediocre pitcl1Lng, and a .poor start on t11e west coast. Thepast Vlinning streak can only of Boston's fastest can be compared with. nothing else. Simply watching the thou- sands of people run by you, not with the hope ofwinning, but merely hoping to fin- ish this test of endurance can bring a tear to the eye and a flutter to the heart. Now, imagine what it would be like to not only go into Bost<>n to see a Red Sox game or a piece of the Marathon, but if one could see both in one day. While this perfect com- bination of up ... close sports viewing seems like a dream, it in fact is a dream that comes true every Patriots Day during the month of May. One day ayear,theRed Sox schedule caters to the Boston Marathon. The first pitch is thrown :at ten o' dock in the mornin!5 so that the final out of the game coincides with the Marathon runners passing by Fen way Park. Just thi11k how invigorating it mean one thing: bad news for the rest of the American League. Y e.s, Baltimore got off to a 10-2 start, Bos- ton is finding ways to win, a11d Cleveland is playing well, but the Y ank:s ar~ proving early that tl!ey are the team to beat in the majors. Last week Baltimore had to put Mike Mus ina on the disabled list and that should only be the beginning oftroulJle. Mus ina is the Orioles best pitcher and o11e of the teams' younger players. As the season progresses look for more Orioles tojoi11Musina. Boston is winning a good deal of one run games and that is always good for team morale. However, the team lacks the intan- gibles, as well as a solid:closer, to dominate this season. Cleveland is lackihg dominant pitching and the injuries wiJI mount. The Indians are a team with a ton of damagedgoods. Do not look for the first week to indicate the teams season. One big surprise from the first weeks of the season has been the New York Mets. Last year the Mets got ·off to a miserable start but received solid starti~tog pitching all year long from no name players. This year the amazings are once again getting good pitching and winning games. WEEKLYBASEBALLPOWER RATINGS 1. New Y otk Yankees 2. Cleveland Indians 3. Baltimore Orioles 4. San Diego Padres 5.

As I grew up, I had this opportunity. I was atle to see both the Red Sox and the Boston Marathon at nearly the same time. Experiencing two of Boston's, but more importantly the worlds, great events within minutes <>feach other is something EVERY child sh<Juld have the opportunity to do. Whether from Boston or California, this is just one of those things that everyone needs to do. So, with the Marathon comihg in justa few weeks, make your plans to head to Boston. I' II be there again, so hopefully I'll run into you. Ben Yaffee, who usually appuws in this location, will return next week. ed COME INTO MOTO PHOTO FOR SUPER SAVINGS!

He crashe<l into the guardrail, and his head wa:.s immediately forced between the guardrail and the roll cage of the car, as there is no outer protection. In order to free Martindale from the wreckage, the Troy Police Depait- ment was forced to use the Jaws of Life. RPI Public Safety responded to the accident, but due to the seri- ousness of the accident, they turned the investigation over to the Troy Police Departm~nt. The Troy Police Department impounded the car, and is continuing their investi- gation; however, ;t is not expected that they will pursue further action. The organizers of the autocross canceled the event on the morning of Sunday the 19th because of the inclement weather. According to Dave Ziembicki. Captain of the RPl Formula SAE team, the RPl Team \made it a policy, about a year or two ago\ to not race on wet sur- faces because of the imminent dan- ger in~olved. \People don't real- ize that they take skill and experi- ence to drive,\ added Ziembicki. Continued on page 3 Joining Together to Bowl For Kids' Sake by Shaun P. Montana Staff Writer On Friday April 24, over 200 Union College students partici- pated in the annual Big Brothers/ Big Sisters Bowl for Kids' Sake. Held at Boulevard Bowl on Erie Boulevard, teams consisting of Greek Houses, Theme Houses, dorm floors, and many clubs bowled to raise money for Big Brothers/Big Sisters. The event featured free bowl- ing for all participants, as well as pizza, soda, and prizes awarded qased on the amount of money an individual raised. Prior to bowl- ing, participants went out and col- lected donations from sponsors; either a flat donation or a certain amount donated per pin. Over twenty lanes were in continuous use all afternoon, with different teams bowling every hour from 1 to 5 PM. There was much friendly competition, especially between team members who tried to out- bowl each other and knock down more pins. According to Matt Pecorelli, a Big Brothers/Big Sisters work study student, \The Greek Sys- tem, The:me Houses, and Indepen- dents all came through huge. Big Brothers/Big Sisters relies on this event for most of their yearly rev- enue, so it's good to see everyone helping out.\ His comments were echoed by Stephanie Wolos, the Co-- ordinator of Big Brothers/Big Sis.- ters at Union. \As Big Brothers/ Big Sisters is a non-profit organ iza.- tion, we depend on this event !() succeed all over the area. It's one event of many that businesses anrl other organizations help us o11t with.\ Wolos further explained that Big Brothers/Big Sisters really ap- preciates the help it receives from Union. With over 200bowlers signed up, and more teams this year than ever before, Wolos looked to see the event raise a lot of money for Bi~ Brothers/Big Sisters. Results ofth e team competitions were unknown; last year, Fiji and Sigma Delta Tau were~the top-raising fraternity an<! sorority, respectively. Both were back this year, with Fiji inviting Dean Alford to relax and bowl for the af- ternoon. Plaques are given to fraternity, sorority, theme house, dorm floor, and club who raise the highest Ct~lltinued on page 4 Aaron Braunstein I TC Mario Cruz at the Big Brothers I Big Sisters Bowl-a-tlwn Boltlevard Bow/last Friday.

(.: I j Campus News camuurbit:tt!lliiS • April 30, 1998 • Page 3 Levine Visits Union, Critiques Judicial System Crash by AnjaliBalasingham Staff Writer On Wednesday, April 22, Union's Grassroots organization hosted a talk by New York appel- late court judge Howard Levine. Levine began his presentation by outlining the importance of under- standing the law in contemporary society. ''In an advanced post-in .. dustrial society where administra- tive agencies govern so much of life, the law is entirely pervasive,\ he said. \Just as we're sitting here now, we're subject to all kinds ·Of health, zoning, safety, and educa- tion regulations. We're completely surrounded by law.\ Levine identified what he thought to be the four basic func- tions of law. Serving at a funda- mental ordering level as a dispute resolution mechanism, the judicial system's trial procedure \avoids complete chaos.\ The law also op- erates in a capacity \in which we (the U.S.)have led the world for 200 years-in ordering political re- lationships and in allocating politi- cal power.\ Thirdly, th:e law \serves as an instrument of social control.\ Levine emphasized, though, that the judicial system cannot com- pletely manage society, since \complex psychological mecha- nisms\ are involved in determin- ing the effectiveness oflaw. \Anti- social behavior is punished [on the premise that] in well-integrated societies, people want to obey the law,\ Levine said. \However in so- cieties that are more fragmented, even though punishments are out Earth by Kimberly Rohback A.&E Editor Last week marked the 27th anni- versary of America's celebration of Earth Day. April22 was Earth Day and started ·off Union's Earth Week. Sponsored by Amnesty In- ternational, and the recently formed Environmental Awareness Club, Earth Week was a reminder to students and faculty of their glo- bal responsibility to protect the planet. Wednesday night at 5 PM in the Campus Centi:r Auditorium, Pro- fessor Laplant of the Civil Engi- neering department lectured to a small but enthusiastic crowd on waste management. Laplant has participated in the engineering of several landfills across the coun- try. Americans throw away ap- proximately five pounds of\trash\ (non-biodegradable material) ev- eryday. This excessive waste is fill- ing up landfills faster than can be accommodated. Laplant sug- gested the use of burn-plants. These facilities separate hazardous material from burnable waste and can· burn an entire county's gar- bage with little damage to the air. The use of\scrubbers'' cleans the air that the plants butn. 'rhe prob- lem, as stated by Professor Leplant, is ''NIMBY''(Notlt1 My BackYard). This is the common response of most Americans when offered to place a 6io-friendly burn-plant in their loc~tion. Thursday,. at 5:00PM, a group of students met outside of the Cam- opment.\ Levine then explained how cases are normally decided. \Under the common law system,\ he said, ''judge-made rule is usually based upon precedent.\ Levine con- ceded that such a traditional mechanism for decision-making \sounds dismal and dull\ but he stressed that precedence has judi- cialvalue. \It's efficientnotto have to repeat the same decision-mak- ing over and over,\ he said. \It also avoids corrupt and arllitrary deci- sion making. And it affords law- yers a basis for determining which way the court will g() on a given issue.\ Levine further said· that precedence is \not as restrictive as one might think. Because-ofthe im- precision ofthe English language, there's usually a line of precedent that can support either side of any case. It provides flex.ibility in the system so that the law can ch:~nge and develop in respons-e to changes of the needs ef s<>dety.\ Levine then enumerated wllat he believed to be the qualities of an ideal appellate court judge. First citing \powers of analysis and powers of craftsmanship\ Levine emphasized the importanceofiden- tifying competing values ina case. A judge must ''make a decisio11that will be consistent with the direc- tion and development of the 'law\. Judges must also have \the ability to write clear and understamlable decisions that will be persuasive. They need to articulate well enough so that their case wilf s.tand with some kind of precedent.'\ ·Perhaps most importantly in Levine's eyes, judges must respon- sibly exercise seJf:..restraint. '\[t's very tempting\ he said, ''si11ce there is little institutional limiting on judges, to take a leap in (ieci- sion-making.\ Such a leap, in tran- scending the case at hand, under- mines the fact that \we are br.und by the facts on the record. Tbe-Te is a general ideologically-drivencon- viction that judges will decide not on precedent but on resuUts.\ Levine proposed an adheren~e to the strictly incremental nature of decision-making, in order to ensure a gradual acceptance of the law that would not estrange tbe pub- lic. Fielding questions from th~ au- dience, Levine offered his opinion of several current issues facin~ the field oflaw. In addressing thes\lc- cess of the present Supreme Court, he said, \I don't see this as a very craftsmanlike court. Their d.eci- sions go on for page after page. There's no real effort to gef a con- sensus anclhave a unanimousopin- · ion, which would create a mor~ narrow dec~sion .... I don't !<;now how anybody can make effective predictions of what the Supreme Court will do, and to me, that means that the court is defeating one of the basic purposes of judicial craft-to create a basis for order- ing our lives. [Undermining this] destroys the legitimacy of the court.\ Levine also voiced concems that the political influences on the judi- cial system are excessive and det- rimental. \The appointment pro- . cess for Supreme Court ju~ges is an utter disaster,\ he said. \TheRe- publican-controlled Senate won't confirm mostofClinton's appoint- ments.\ Despite the problems facing the system today, Levine remained positive about his career experi- ences. \This is my 27th year as a judge,\ he said, \and I've enjoyed each and every year that I've worked.\ Grassroots' Jennifer Roberts, who organized the event, was pleased with the evening's out- come. \I think it went really well,\ she said. \Although we had hoped for a larger turnout, I think that the intimate, close setting a11owed ev- eryone to speak only. Having a smaller group allowed Judge Levine to share his personal views, too. S<r it was beneficial for us, and I think that he also appreciated the opportunity to be able to discuss issues that he thought to be im- portant.\ ..• continued from page 1 Martindale was not a member of RPI 's Formula SAE team, and was not friends with anyone on the team, said Maloney. Union stu- dents allowed Maloney to drive their car right before Martindale did. Maloney used the car with a helmet, and when he was done got out and walked away. He turned around and saw Martindale driv~ ing the car, and witnessed the en- suing accident. Maloney could not offer comment as to why Union students would allow non-team members to operate their automo- bile. It is RPl team policy to only allow team members to handle their car. All attempts Concordiensis has made to contact a representative from the Mechanical Engineering Department have been rebuffed, and Union College and its admin- istration officially has no comment on the situation, according to Pub- lic Relations Director Charlie Casey. All members of Union's Formula SAE racing team have been or- dered to not talk about the issue without la~yers representing Union College present. Concordiensis has not learned of any litigation filed against Union surrounding the incident. As of press time, Martindale had been moved out of the Intensive Care Unit in Albany Med, listed in fair condition. He is still being treated for a head injury, and AMC officials did not know when Martindale would possibly re- leased. Week Catie Curtis Concert a Success pus Center to conduct a clean up of Lock 8.

Friday marked the culmination of Earth Week with Battle of the Bands. The first band to perform was The Children. They played a fifteen minute set, and were fol- lowed by the dynamite duo of RogerNoyesandKimKilby. The two usually perform with their band Green Eyes, whose other members were unable to perform that evening. Next to perf(lrm was Sue Skinny and 11 Inches of Finger Funic. They performed for the large audience gathered 011 the lawn outside the Campus Center. They were followed by Fo()ls of Our- selves who cracked up the audi- ence with their sarcastic wit and painted faces. The final band to perform, and the winner of 'the Battle of the Bands, was The Full Montelles. \I always }()veto watch 1ft em perform. They are so funny;'' said Gina . LaSorsa. The contest was judged by members of the C()nCert com- mittee, headed by senior Matt Finke1ste.in. The Full Montelles will be playing at Spring Fest in a few weeks. Earth Week was a saccess. The efforts of Amnesty International, the Envitonmental Awareness Group and the freshmen, sopho- more and junior class representa- tives did not go unno1iced .. by Becky Moyer Contributing Wtiter This past Saturday, sin~er/ songwriter Catie Curtis visEted Union College. Curtis led a. wa~rk­ shop at the Coffeehouse, and per- formed in Memorial Chapel later that evening. The concert a11d workshop were sponsore<l lly UBGLAD, the Intellectual Emtch- ment Fund, the Womyn .. s Uii.ion and the Coffeehouse. Curtis is a folksinger quick[:y ris- ing in popularity in the folk world, and her songs bring to the stage an intimacy between the music 1 the audience, and the perfonner ber- self. Her most recent album 'has achieved high praise, includillg the 1997 Gay and Lesbian American Music Award's (GLAMA) All>um of theY ear, competing against Illore widely known albums such as k.d. lang's Drag and the Indig() Girls' Shaming of the Sun. The atmosphere provided by Memorial Chapel gave the perfor- mance a rich tone, both physically and acoustically. Curtis obviously enjoyed singing in the venue, and the concert was very well recei'Ved by the audience. \One thing that I'm reminded of every time I hear her play is how easy it is to get drawn right into the song,\ said off-campus at- tendee Susan Schinaman. \When she is singing about a town it's al- most as if I'm seeing what she's describing. I lose thought of where I am and I think of a town or street that I know of that the song re- minds me of. It's like your heart lias ears.\ Freshman Michael Capraro en- joyed the concert as well. \She was fun to watch because you could really get into the show,\ said Capraro. \She really enjoys being . on stage.\ During the workshop in the af- ternoon, Curtis discussed her past and where she comes from as an artist, as well as her own struggles currently as a musician looking for a new record label Curtis' upbring- ing in small town Maine has brought an understanding of indi- vidual struggles into her mtiSic. Curtis identifies herself as a gay musician, but hates to be defined as such. \rve never wanted to la- bel rnyse1f as a gay musician be- cause most ofthe self-labeled gay and feminist musicians I saw in college didn't have anything inter• esting to say and generally were poor musicians,\ said Curtis. \My music isn't about being gay; it's about being human.\ Aaren Hatalsky would agree with Curtis' view of her songwriting, and sees Curtis as \a poignant and power- ful love song writer. Her songs touch everyone in a different, yet personal way.\ Her set was comprised mostly of songs from her two latest albums Truth From Lies and Catie Curtis, intennixed with a few old songs and some new compositions. Her per- formance of the song Radical was especially well done, evoking a loud response from the crowd. Stage manager James Naumes said that \it was a pleasure to work on the show. Catie Curtis was light hearted and easy-going (traits you often don't see in professional per- formers) which made our efforts seem less like work and more like play.'' Full Monte lies band leader Arya Chowdhury said, \Heruse of drum triggers embellished many of her songs. It perfectly complimented the acoustic guitar.\ While Curtis is known across the country, her down to earth attitude conveys her genuine personality both on and off stage.

Jack Melito, the Executive Direc- t() I of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of 1h e Capital Region, provided some insight into the total Bowl for Kids' · Sa:ke picture. The event usually raises about $150,000, butthis year <1rganizers are shooting for $180,000. The event is broken up into three phases. First is the league phase, when league bowlers .are asked to collect pledges from SJ>Onsors. Then, Big Brothers/Big Sisters volunteers come on a pre- determined league night to keep track of scores and collect dona- tion sheets from the bowlers. The second phase is called \Ce- lebrity Weekend,\ when people ~ho don't usually bowl are asked to collect donations and come bowl on a pmticular clay around the Capi- tal Region. This year the weekend was March 21 and 22, with over 500 teams participating. The third phase, which Union participates in, is the competition bowls. This is when an organiza- ti()n comes as a group with ten or rnore teams, having collected do- na1ions, to ho-w I on a day and in a placeoftheirchoosing. Area busi- nesses such as State Farm, SEFQ Credit Union, Blue Cross/Blue Sllield, and Bell Atlantic participate in competition bowls, as well as Union and Siena. \The average competition bowl raises about tl!ree to four thousand dollars; U11ion usua!Jy raises double that.

The Union students departed by chartere.<l b11s at around 12:30 PM WednesEay aftemoon, and arrived at the Delmarva Inn around 9 PM. Among :tile :stUdents were Profes- sors Wemer (Chemistry), Kaplan (Sociolo~y),Ghaly (Civil Engineer- ing)andAdJlian(Chemistry). These professor:s co Ilectively. attended every Ullion students' poster ses-· sion or ])resentation, mirroring the support tiut the students also ex- tended tovvardsone another. Stacy Drossmllll C()mmented that Graham :Bryce i11 ])articular attended as many presentations as physically possible,offering insightful ques- tions indi<:ating the attention he dedicate(j: to each speaker. The sessi{)ns be an at 8:30AM · ers were assigned a specific class- room where they spoke with three other students. The classrooms were set up such that presenters with similar topics were placed to- gether. This facilitated discussion since it increased the likelihood· that members ef the audience would be able to pose informed, intuitive questions to the speaker. Drossman rated her experience very positively, stating, \it was ex- citing to get to share research that you worked on all year with people outside of Union College.\ Students who designed posters of their research also kept to the same time frames as the oral pre- sentation. For instance, someone in poster session one would put up their work by 8:30 and answer questions of anyone wlw ap- proached them. Students could also interact in social settings as well, such as during the communal meals, events, and local trips. The second night, students convenedata crab dinner, sponsored by NCUR. On the third night, there was a limbo contest, where Doug Schneider placed first and Drossman took second place. Students also built a giant sand castle together, en- joyed the steel drums and mellow vocals of a reggae band, and sampled a wide variety of foods like barbequed burgers and hot dogs, snow cones, and com on the cob. During the breaks in presen- tations and these festivities, some students alse went to Ocean City.

These to\}ics seem to be avoided in pub- lic places. They are usually dis- cussed behind the closed doors of one's home. But, Wendy McElroy d ernonstrated no qualms about sharing her ideas about the afore- me11tioned subjects. McElroy spoke in the Reamer Carnpus Center Auditorium on lvi<>nday night. Womyn's Union sponsored the event. Heather B.uanno, thepresidentofWomyn's lJnion, opened the presentation witb a short, descriptive back- ground of McElroy. McElroy was born and raised ~nOttawa, Canada. Sbe ran away from home at the yoang age of 16. Although she f!llced hardships and difficulties, slle did not tut11 to a life of drugs nor prostitution. Instead, McElroy j&urneyed to Los Angeles and 'WCJrked in a plethora of dead end joibs during the day while writing a11d conducting research at night. 11er opportunity came when Cato Institute hired her to write the in- traduction to Freedom, Feminism and the State, an anthology of in- divi<lualist-fern in ism. McElroy's career blossomed allowing to work her as a writer and then as a !'\eries manager for a Nashville produc- tion company. In 1995, McElroy published a boCJk calledA?t:X:· A Woman's Right to Pornography (St. Martin's Press). This textoffereda feminist's defense of pornograplly. Both femi- nism and pornographyare interests of McElroy due to her experiences living on the street d11ring her teen years. \Being on the streets, I saw the choices I didn't tnal<e, such as prostitution. I began to identify with, and be concemedforthe least powerful people in society-women, but not all women. I'm most con- cemed with how poveFty and other circumstances force women into making certain choices.\ McElroy claims th<~t pornogra- phy benefits women.However, she realizes that it is not brall women. She argues that wo111en should have the opportunity ttl make the decision for themselves. She is a strQng activist for self-ownership and believes that every human has moral jurisdiction over his or her own body. Therefore, each person can make the choice- to practice prostitution, experience pornogra- phy or expel it from their existence. McElroy feels that ifllln individual is comfortable with hisor her own body and wishes to exhibit their body it should be allo'-Ved and ac- cepted in our society. But, this is not the case. Prostitution is illegaJ:and is sub· ject to criminal charges. Those who associate with prostiflltes can also be arrested. McElroy argues that these laws should not be enforced because they do not stop prosti· tution nor do they help the prosti- tutes.

Special Commission charged with dis- mantling its weapons of mass destruction to prove that any banned weapons or related equipment remained. Amer al-Saadi, adviser to President Saddam Hussein, said U.N. Security Council discussions in New York on Monday :should focus on lifting the trade embargo imposed more than seven years ago when Iraq invaded Kuwait. \Iraq has dismantled aH weapons of mass destruction, biological, chemical, ballistic and nu.clear. It is al:l finished,\ Saadi, onetime head ofl raq' s Military Industrialization Commission, told Reuters in an interview. \We want the U.N. to recognize this. and discuss the implementation of Article 22 (of Security Council Resolution 687). This is what should be discussed by the Security Council,\ he added. The article would allow Iraq to export oil and other commodities freely once it had dismant•led all banned weapons and is seen by Iraq as a stepping stone to lifting the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \Article 22 was not designed to remain forever. It was tied to Iraq's implementation of three articles, 8, 9 and 1 0., which call for the reAdering hann less of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, their means of production and the research and development conceming them,\ Saadi said. 12:00-l:OOPM College Center auditorium: \Recruiting diversity: Race and Admissions\ led by Dean Dan Lundquist and Associate Dean Darryl Tiggle of the Admissions Office \Iraq has done that, fulfilied it completely.

India Denies ·Report of Weapon Project NEW DELHI, India (Reuters)- India on Monday denied a New York Times report that Russia was helping New Delhi build a sea-launched ballistic missile that could carry a nuclear warhead and strike deep into Pakistan. \India does not have any project like this,\ a defense ministry spokesman to'ld Reuters. The Times said assistance had continued for three years despite assurances from Russia that its scientists were not contributing restricted technoi<Jgy to India's missile program. U.S. Vice President AI Gore and other top administration officials have appealed to the Russians to stop, but have had little success, the paper said, citing unnamed Clinton administration officials. Although not tested, the missile is said to have a t:ange of nearly 200 miles and is meant to be launched from submerged submarines, the Times said. Its name is the Sagarika, which means oceanic in Hindi. The paper said its administration sources fear the program could inflame tensions in South Asia. Canada's PM to Urge Cuban Prisoner Releases· HAVANA (Reuters)- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, on a controversial two-day vis it to Cuba, will appeal for the release.offour leading dissidents in talks Monday with communist leader Fidel Castro. Senior officials in his~delegation, announcing the news Sunday night, were concerned to allay criticism that Chretfen 's publicly broadcast remarK's on his arrival $unday evening were much softer than Castro's. \The winds of change are blowing through our hemisphere and we all must adapt,\ Chretien said at Havana airport in the presence of Castro, who was dressed in his trademark olive-green fatigues. Chretien also referred to PopeJohnPaul's historic visit in January, when the pontiff urged Cuba to open up to the world. But most of Chretien's remarks- his only speech until his scheduled departtue Tuesday at noon.- were in vague diplomatic tenns. Chretien made no mention of prisoners, elections or freedom and only one passing reference to human rights. The Canadian officials told reporters afterward that Chretien would make·a general appeal on behalf of a total estimated 350 political prisoners held in Cuba at some point during two meetings scheduled for Monday. \We are making a general pleaforthe release of all political prisoners, and we're specifically asking for those four to be freed,\ a senior Canadian official said. The four- Vladimiro Roca, MarthaBeatriz Roque, Felix Bonne and Rene Gomez Manzano- were detained July 16, 1997, after efforts to unite dissident groups on the island. They have not been tried but authorities say they are being investigated on suspicion of \counterrevolutionary\ activities. Swiss Banks on Thin Ice; Holocaust Talks Start ZURICH, Switzerland (Reuters)· Big Swiss banks risk criticism at home when they start negotiations in Washington Monday with the World Jewish Congress and lawyers for Holocaust victims who accuse the banks ofhoarding their wartime wealth. Some Swiss commentators question whether the banks are stabbing their country in the back by trying to arrange a separate peace with their critics while neutral Switzerland is still coming to grips with its role in World War II. Should the Swiss conclude that banks are buying their way out of a jam that affects the whole country, it could deepen the divide between the mighty financial institutions and Swiss already upset ()ver profitable banks' big layoffs, they say. \Paying back your debts is one thing. Yielding to unjustified demands is another,\ Sigi Feigel and Werner Stauffacher wrote in a comment for the conservative Neue Zuercher Zeitung (NZZ) newspaper at the week- end. Feigel is honorary chairman of Zurich's Jewish community. Both men are vice-chainnen of a group support- ing the government's plan to sell gold reserves and create a huge humanitarian fund f\x victimsofpoverty and rights abuses. Th~y s•1ggested banks, insurers and industry discuss a common strategy for handling accusations that neutral Switzerland cynically profited from the war by dealing extensively \Vith Nazi Gennan) and then \Vith- hdd Holocaust victims' riches.

Some of these .poor habits include im- properposture, ·lack ofbreaks, and pounding on the keyboard. Erg0nomists recommend sit- tingapproximately 18 to 28 inches away from the moniter with the screen 15 to 30 degrees he low your straight line of sight to prevent straining to read the screen. The wrists should be straight while your elbows should be perpen- aicular to your upper arm. WhHe sitting straight is helpful, a \per- fect\ posture can be harmful ifheld for an extended period of time. It is important to take breaks, move, and change pDsitions several times. While many pew products have been created to make typing more comfortable and safe, customers are often not instructed how to properly use them. Wrist rests were intended to give a place for the wrists to rest, just as the name indicates; however, most people incorrectly place their wrists on the pad and stretch their fingers to reach the keys rather than having their arms move their hands. Today's most popular typing aids include the \trackpad\ and voice recognition systems. Despite a plethora of ergonomic products, it is only when people \make the long term changes in technique and work habits\ that those with RSI can return to a normal, pain- free Hfe. Researchers have discov- ered that tilting the back edge of the keyboard down helps maintain a proper typing pesition. They recommend touching the keys lightly, using two hands for func- tions requiring two keys, and us- ing a light grip on the mouse. While cold muscles and tendons are more likely to get injured, one can reduce this risk by making sure his hands and arms are always warm when typing. D<Jctors strongly recommend that people with symptoms includ- ing a tightness, numbness, or loss of strength in the hands, wrists, arms, or shoulders 'seek medical assistance immediately because RSI is much easier to prevent than to cure. When symptoms arise, there is already some damage, therefore it is imperative to seek help as soon as :possible. Treat- ments can include ibuprofen, a Wrist-brace, icing and resting the affected area, physical therapy and, in the most severe cases, sur- gery.

Some of these poor habits include im- proper JlOSture, lack ofbreaks, and pounding on the keyboard. Ergonomists recommend sit- ting appr<Jximately 18 to 28 inches away from the monitor with the screen 15 to 30 degrees below your straight line of sight to prevent straining t<J read the screen. The wrists should be straight while your elbows should be perpen- dicular to your upper arm. While sitting straight is helpful, a \per- fect\ posture can be harmful if held for an extended period of time. It is impottant to take breaks, move, and change positions several times. While many !lew products have been created to make typing more comfortable and safe, customers are often not instructed how to properly use them. Wrist rests were intended to give a place for the wrists to rest, just as the name indicates; however, most people incorrectly place their wrists on the pad and stretch their fingers to reach the keys rather than having their arms move their hands. Today's most popular typing aids include the \trackpad\ and voice recognition systems. Despite a plethora of ergonomic products, it is only when people \make the long term changes in technique and work habits\ that those with RSI can return to a normal, pain- free life. Researchers have discov- ered that tilting the back edge of the keyboard down helps maintain a proper typing position. They recommend touching the keys lightly, using two hands for func- tions requiring two keys, and us- ing a light grip on the mouse. While cold muscles and tendons arc more likely to get injured, one can reduce this risk by making sure his hands and anns are always warm when typing. Doctors strongly recommend that people with symptoms includ- ing a tightness, numbness, or loss of strength in the hands, wrists, arms, or shoulders seek medical assistance immediately because RSI is much easier to prevent than to cure. When symptoms arise, there is already some damage, therefore it is imperative to seek help as soon as possible. Treat- ments can include ibuprofen, a wrist-brace, icing and resting the affected area, physical therapy and, in the most severe cases, sur- gery.

My first reaction was, \why are they all so ugly?\ But, after sec- ond thought, I remembered that this is probably a good thing. You see the uglier the class is, the smarter they are and if they're smarter, the better our school's reputation is going to be. It's hard to explain, but I'll break it down into a formula so it's a little easier to understand: {l/2pLi}/{2xcv} To help these prospective stu- dents make their decision, I have decided to include in this week's column a self-guided walking tour of the most popular sites on and off campus. The school provides some important sites for a quality tour, however they do not tell the whole story. For a COMPLETE tour, read below. First I'll give the most important sites as stated by the school, then I'll give my own suggestions. Here goes: to visit the basement, the strong odor may prepare you for the ho- rizon expanding college experi- ence. The second hand smoke may be both breathtaking and ex- hilarating for you and your par- ents as they are taken back to their days as hippies. With the new fif- teen~ year plan, AD may soon come to be known as AB (admin- istration building). Yulman Theatre: Yulman Theatre, built only a few years ago, has been constructed from the ground up to a fairly func- tional theatre maintaining mild respect for the arts at Union Col- lege. It has been put on the map through the efforts of hard work- ing students like Amy Rilling. If possible on your trip, make sure to take in a play and maybe you' 11 catch a glimpse of Amy before she graduates and moves on to arts school. Because the content of plays is for a11 audiences, Yulman will not deny admission to your younger siblings. Geppetto's Bar and Grill: kindergarteners. Jacks()n's Garden: Because of the beautiful landscaping of the gardens, few would deny the fact that it is one of the most attractive features on campus. As your eyes meander from one end of the gar- dens to the other, you will become intoxicated with the smell of fresh air and beauty of nature. It is easy to see that the amount of work put into the making of Jackson's Gar- den was great and the result of many weeks of effort. The Stream at Jackson's Gar- dens: Quite possibly the only blemish to the garden's landscap- ing, few would deny that the stream has become its most unat- tractive feature. Meandering from one end of the landscape to the other, the stream displays its strange color and noxious smell primarily because it is heavily con- centrate.d with stale liquor and vomit. Unfortunately, the self~ guided tourpamphlet does mention this as you are forced to find it out for yourself. From the noxious smell, you may become nauseous and decide to add to the stream's contents. It is easy to see that, be- cause it flows easily and ruils deep, the stream is the result of many slackers and allowing the \Pow- :ers That Be\ make all the deci- sions for us. This time my letter is aimed squarely at one aspect of the Master Plan. I hate to state the obvious, but the Planning Committee, et. al. have their heads in the sand, so here goes: ALMOST NO ONE CHOOSES UNION COLLEGE BASED UPON HOW T.HE AD- MISSIONS OFFICE LOOKS!!! Students don't say (or even think), \Well I was on the fence between . Hamilton and Union, and damn! that Admissions Office at Union College was SO awesome!\ Con~ versely, prospective students are not rejecting Union because the current Admissions Office at Union College looks only so-so. Students select Union College because they came to the campus and had a kick -ass weekend, or be- cause they wanted to continue to play a sport in co1Iege, or because friends or family graduated from Un~on. They wanted to learn in a small-college environment; to be nurtured and prodded by profes- sors and coaches, to make new friends. In short, it is PEOPLE- not buildings-who persuade pro- spective students to attend Union College. It is absolutely insulting to the intelligence of students for admin- istrators, etc. to suggest that higher-caliber students will choose Union because of a nicer admis- sions building. Most students and their families spend a few hours in that building. Except for the Gatekeepers, most Union students never set foot in the Admissions Office again in four years of col- lege. Current students ought to be furious that the people who sup- port moving Admissions believe a fancier building attracts smarter students (does this mean that cur- rent students are only average be- cause our Admissions building looks only average?) This aspect of the Master Plan panders to su- perficiality and gimmicks of aes- thetics-rather than to the intelli- gence, discernment, and psyche of prospective students. It is a monumental waste of money to pursue the Alpha Delta Phi House as the new admissions building. This acquisition will re- . quire capital outlays for its reno- vation whose utility and returns are dubious and misguided. Why not use that money to lower our tu- ition? As Duncan Crary so elo- quently wrote in his letter last week, moving Admissions to the AD building is the destruction of living heritage. Being a great col- lege is NOT about beautiful build- ings. It should be about cultivat- ing great people. Is moving Ad- missions to that particular space the best way to do this? Respectfully, Alissa M. Mayo '98 The Nott Memorial: An essen- tial aspect of the tour, the Nott Memorial is the only sixteen-sided building in the Northern Hemi- sphere. Only a few years ago it was a hollowed out shell with the roof falling in on it. People new to the academic building now say that their first reaction is both breathtaking and exhilarating. Unfortunately, Geppetto's is not mentioned in the self-guided tour pamphlet put out by the school (don't ask me why). Rather than put money into the Arts, we have built Geppetto' sup from the sta- tus of ''some random bar\ into a goldmine. Students have poured down almost the same amount of alcohol at Gepetto's as rain that has that has come through the roof at Yulman. weekends of effort put forth by 1-------------------\------- U~~;;~u~:~!~·Like a hibernating ••• And a Response from Alpha Delta Phi: Make sure to stop by at AD Phi on your tour for it just may be the dirtiest and least kept fraternity in the northern hemisphere. Like the Nott Memo- rial of years past, AD Phi has more or less become a hollowed out shell. With its roof falling in on it, fraternity action has been forced into the basement. If you and your parents decide Paulie, the owner ofGepetto's, has put the bar on the map and because of the great number of prospectives currently visiting the campus, has decided that it would be good for profits if he refused to deny admission to both you and your younger siblings. Here's a suggestion Paulie: two for one on pitchers for the eleven and under crowd and half off shots for animal, President Hull sleeps all th. e Dean of Admt·sst·on·s year 'round and comes out of hid~ ing only to see the prospectives.

There are other fun spots that the administration left out of the tour. (I don't want to give anything away, but we can qualify the en~ tire city of Schenectady under this label.) Send letters to box# l 058. Dear Editors, Quick reaction to the piece in last week's Opinions section re- garding the College's proposed Master Plan and the proposed fu- ture of the AD structure. As one who saw his college (Amherst) radically change-go coeducational and ban fraterni- ties-for the better, I am frustrated but not surprised by the reaction. Colleges are institutions that need to change; they need to fos- ter growth and development. As someone who cares deeply about Union College, I strongly support any intelligent, open minded dia- logue regarding our future.

One of the driving factors behind this debate is the view held by sup- porters ofthis plan, that by participating in a Greek organization dur- ing freshman year, freshmen are somehow losing focus on why·they are attending college.. The fate of this freshman experience, which many fraternity and sorority members cite as an invaluable and en- riching aspect of,their freshman years, is still to be decided. The tirne commitment ofpledging has been cited as detrimental to freshmen; :professors have complained, as they have a right to, about lethargic students neglecting their work. Proponents of a sophomore rush believe that the rush and pledging process is to blame. How~ ever, the incentive to do well in college and to put one's nose to the grindstone comes from the individual. Some freshmen do see changes for the worse in their grades. Those students whose grades slip allow an extracurricular activity to interfere with their grades. Ifthey were · not involved in a Greek organization, they would find something else As a member of the Union community I believe she wanted to point out that she was offended by being included in celebration that is a direct slap in her face. Although I truthfully have no opinion on the celebra- tion and may 0rmaynot attend, looking fromMs Mosa's point of view, the fact that I was told I was celebrat- ing iris a little strange, though not offensive to me. Judging from the response to Ms. Mosa's letter, I can tell that there are some very sensitive issues on both sides so I can understand how such a statement could cause the reaction that it did. These letters have defi- nitely broughtthe Arab-Israeli conflict aUttlecloser to home forme in that I can read about a minor one in our school. I find the opinions stated in these letters intriguing as I hope that they can make people recognize both sides ofthis issue fully. Possibly, discussi()n can result and bring about more understanding on campus rather than conflict. Sincerely, Jean-Paul Jones '00 to do rather than class work. 1------------------------------- ...... ---------------- This is a problem that the individual must learn, through trial and error, to solve for themselves. On the other hand, many fraternity and • sorority members are able to achieve very high GPAs during pledg- · ing, even higher than during other terms. The reason for this is time management. Rushing and becoming a member of a Greek house is largely a lesson in structuring time. In addition, the time involved in a Greek organization is the same as the amount of time a dedicated member of a Theme House or any other campus club with a goal ·Is a Dean's Warning a Threat to Confidence?

I believe nothing but our gender mattered to him. fact: the student did not have a cu- mulative GPA of 2.0. As for ques- tioning their abilities, re-readthe let- ter and see if it actually does that. The letter 'states: \We urge you to give thoughtful consideration to the rea- sons for your inadequate achieve- ment...\ The letter is actually assum- ing the student is capable of achiev- ing a 2.0, and that for various rea- sons did not reach that goal. The anonymous freshman next states that the Dean should \uncover [the]. r~ason\ wby each student is placed on Academic Warning. As one of the student representatives on the Committee on the Standing of Students, I can assure you that we would love to know the individual details of each case. I can also reasonably assure you that the Dean's office would like to be able to send an individualized let- ter to each student on academic warning, after having \uncov- ered\ all the different reasons why each student might be placed on warning. The CSS places over I 00 students pertenn on academic warning, however, and the time it would take to complete such a task makes it an impossibility. The CSS meetings take four or five hours as it is, when we are just reviewing the students' grades for the term along with their past histories. Even if ail the informa- tion were ready for us at the meet- ing, it would still take days to walk through all the details of each in- dividual case. I cannot imagine how long itwouldtakethe Dean's office and the Registrar's office to try and compile all the nuances of each individual case to present to us at the meeting. The anonymous freshman ends by asking \Isn't it possible for a respected student with a strong GPA to have a bad term or a diffi- cult class?\ The answer of course is yes, everyone has a bad class or tenn now or then. But the CSS doesn't have time to differentiate, and the Dean's office doesn't have time to spend writing each letter differently. The bottom line is that for the given tenn, the student who is on academic warning and re- ceived their letter had a GPA be- low a 2.0, whatever the reasons. Everyone, whether they have a cumulative of3.5 or a ct~rnulative of 1.8 receives the same Jetter of warning, and they received the let- ter because they earned it. The anonymous freshman writes \The way I see it is that [the Dean's] have questioned our academic in- tegrity and capabilities, now I am questioning theirs.\ The Dean's office writes the Jetter on behalf of the CSS, reflecting our decision in each individual case. We as a committee are not ques- tioning anyone's integrity-we are merely asking you to look, as an adult, at yollr past term and figure out where your difficulties lay. To say the Deans do not have aca- demic integrity or capabilities be- cause they are doing their job in dealing with students' academic difficulties is wrong. In increas- ing numbers, people in today's so- ciety try to shift responsibility for their actions to others, and lash out at those they feel are to blame. Accept the responsibility for your poor work, and perform better in the next tenn. Sincerely, Seth M. Carrier Class of 2000 A jerk on Saturday night, as anyone at this school can say they have witnessed, I am almost posi- tive, is what I was dealing with. And I have many times before. This is exempli:fied even more, I believe, with the fact that the next couple of students who came around the corner showed a simi• lar attitude. My same friend and I were walking on campus one night during a fall term weekend. At approximately 12:30 a.m. we saw two \men\ wrestling on the asphalt. This is an unusual spec- tacle and, I think that almost any- one would cast at least a glance in that direction. However, the two wrestlers, amused by our presence, told us to stop look- ing at them and were relentless that we \sluts\ leave them alone. To make sure of this they got up and followed behind. My friend and I, both females, decided to walk away as fast as we could because these two angry and·in- toxkated guys seemed intent on pursuing us until we were too afraid to further retort.

I had the misfortune of finding out last night that the fights on The Jerry Springer Show are fixed. Let me put this in perspective for you, this is like finding out that the tooth fairy isn't real or that Mickey Mouse doesn't exist. Basically, this is a shocking piece of news. I feel cheated, scammed, and deceived. This little story will dramatically alter my opinion of Jerry Springer and his stupid show. In this week's column, I intend to take a more straightforward, serious, and direct approach to writing this article. Whether that works out or not, will be deter- mined at the end. But looking back at the last couple of columns, i have made a decision that I need to regain my focus. Many people on this campus have an opinion of me as, shall we say in language that can be printed in this article, a less than good per- son. And I would have to respond to their allegations by agreeing \.Vith them. I am not a saint. I very rarely do the right thing. But when I do the right thing, it is an event. So r would just like to take a few seconds of your time to let you know about my above average week as a human being. We all say th!!$ if another per- son was harassing someone, and you were there. that you would help the victim But would you? If you were really in this situation would you') J can honestly look at myself in the mirror and answer no; I wouldn't help the victim. Why I ie to myself and say that I used option of all the options, de- would when I wouldn't. One thing fend the ladies. I do consider myself to be is an honest person. For some unexplainable reason I changed this week. I think I de- veloped one of those things that my friends have been referring to as a conscience. Whatever the rea- son may be, I decided to help a person in a time of need, and for once, l was not looking to gain anything out of it. At this point you must be dying to know what I did, so let me set the scene for you. Around seven o'clock on Tuesday night I was outside tossing around the old baseball with a friend of mine. While out there, I notice a group of punk Schenectady kids sitting on the walloutside of West smok- ing butts being the cool kids that they are. But they were minding their own business, so I did likewise. Mind you these are the same kids who rollerblade every single day in front of my window so I can't get any work done. Keeping that in mind, I still mind my own busi- ness. At this point, two innocent young ladies exit West Dining Hall and head back to Richmond. The two kids on the wall start making harassing comments at them. I at this point I had three options. Option number one, ignore the ~ituation and continue to mind my own business. Option number two, join in on the side of the Schenectady kids making fun of the young ladies {T actually con· sidcrcd this option). Or option number three, the least likely to be I chose option three. I turned to my friend and told him that we needed to step in. At tbat point I started yelling like I was crazy. This froze one ofthe two kids. My friend ran after him. But the sec- ond kid was taking off towards Fox, and hehadrollerblades and a head start. I may not be the fastest kid ever to walk onto this campus, but I am also not the smartest. I made a split second decision that on foot, I could catch a kid on rollerblades, ( It's a good thing that I am a com- plete idiot because I ran down the kid on rollerblades, using a burst of speed that one onlooker termed, \Michael Johnsonesque.\ So we caught the kids, and as campus security would say, \advised them off campus.\ I now have-first hand knowledge that advising someone of campus doesn't do a damn thing. · The moral of the story is not to make myself seem like a better person. I don't even know who the girls are and ifl was put in that situation again, I probably wouldn't have reacted the same way. It was my moment of glory so back off and cut me some slack. The point is that I can do the right thing. Maybe not every day, but for once in my life, I did it. What this story should do is serve as an inspiration to an slow, fat, stupid kids everywhere. You can catch the punk on rollcrbladcs. If you don't think about it, you can do it. around us. We take out our aggres- sions, anger and hurt on the ones who care about us most. It seems like such an imnic thing, that when I am most upset, I yell and scream and cry to the people who are the least cause of all that anguish. But the question is, where else can I tum? Running miles until I can barely breathe, pouring out my soul into words in my journal, yell- . ing at myself for. being so inadequate ... when it all comes down to it, none of these things can help as much someone listening to me and caring. Essentially, we are all social beings. We thrive on interaction with others. We cannot exist alone. And it is because of this fact that things called friendships exist. Friendships are neat concepts cre- ated by societY that give us an ex- cuse to push off our hurt and bur- dens onto someone else, if even for a little while. We all do it without a second thought, sitting and lis- tening to someone for hours be- cause that is what a friend does. We do not question the responsi- bility that 1hat term implies. A \friend\ is forever loyal, utterly devoted. So, in times like these, when I am pushing rny arms up so hard against the current of stress that I believe no one understands; there is someone who understands. Ac- tually, it is everyone who under- stands. At this age, we are all go- . ing thmugh the madness of grow- ing up together. There is a com- mon link that hinds us, and that link is that we are all slowly teach- ing ourselves how not to be mis- erable in light of pressure and striving for success. I know that my stress is trying hard to con- sume me and beat me in this war. But, in the end it is my choice. I choose whether or not I will be defeated. I guess I never realized that un- til recently. Sadly, thatrealization came to me in the fonn of a for- ward over e-mail A few lines of which read, \'You can choose to ·be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.

Features Computers Are Not People by Arya Chowdury Contributing Wl'iter Human beings would like to be- lieve that they are the wheel in the unfolding of events around them. Our power and control <>ver nature seems overwhelmingly evident in light of the atomic bomb and the multirude of various toys we de- velop to isolate ourselves from so- ciety. If we wanted to, we could step on the accelerator and com- press the future into a picosecond. Thanks to computers, space ve- hiCles, and architects oftonwrrow, the natural cycles of the universe can be tracked to an infrn ite degree. But is it really now? Honestly, people are admitted!ly irrational beings and prone to erratic behav- ior. In The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera declares, \When the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object. In the realm ofkitsch, the dictatorship of the heart reigns supreme.\ So, does the fact that we are par- tial to emotion debunk any value judgments we might harbor? For example, in the field of artificial life, people are searching for age- netic algorithm which would allow a computer to have some sort of DNA-coding as instructions for self-replication; a rather rough defi- nition for life, but one with an in- tuitive flavor. If a computer pro- gram could replicate itself and bring itself to life, then how spe- cial is senral reproduction? The key is artificial life. A computer's existence may have points of origin and termination, but between them, does it experience life? Can it ever know the joy of a good conversation? Can it ever feel that adrenaline rush before a bungee jump? And could it ever come to grips with falling in love? This would open up new fields of study into Oedipal complexes of compw.ters, relationship .dy- namics between computers, and so forth. The last thing the world needs is a 21st century· Freud! I was flipping through a book · of Salvador DaWs art. I opened to an oil painting called \Swans Reflecting Elepllants.\ It presents a colorful landscape with swans floating on a lake with an island of barren tree trunks in the back- drop. Upon first glance, it appears to be an innocuous depiction of a typical nature scene; however, when you focus on the reflections of the swams ancl tree trunks in the water, you notice that the shapes . rniagle and fonn elephants stand- ing on the edge of the shore. The . idea of the \double image\ is a staple of Dali' s; he expertly pre- sents analogies and metaphors as visual shapes on canvas. There is an important distinc- tion between machines and hu- mans. Throughout the hish)ry of computer programming, humans are trying to convince the com- puter to establish relationships and analogues which seem so na- tive aad fundamental to human . understanding, yet so foreign to an entity which must be told what to do and how to perceive objects. We can post passages of our fa- vorite books on the Intemet, but the computer wi 11 not be enlight- ened. We can save our most pri- vate thoughts in a computer di- ary, but the mac1Jine is a few de- grees short from psychiatry. We may be irrational, but we have the capacity to feel emotions and be at peace with the fact that maybe humans don't have such a finn grasp on the wheel. cs weekend, I came up with a Union Etiquette Test. See where you fare. l.On your way into the Cam- pus Center, someone holds the door open for you. Your re- sponse is: (A) \Tbanx.\ (B) CoRlplete and utter silence.

Me or you?\ (C)\Shouldn 't you be m0re wor- ried about all those trash ca11 fires I've been hearing abomt? They pose a bigger problem.

The Big Miss No one ever said being a profes- sional hitman is easy. Killing is nothing compared te the women problems and personal issues that the modern day assassin must en- dure. So what do you get when you combine an unstable hitman, three backstabbing associates, an unfaithful mistress, an annoying fiancee, the in-laws, and the kid- napped daughter of a bankrupt Japanese millionaire? The answer is perhaps one of the worst mov- ies we have reviewed this year The Big Hit follows the exploits ofMel (Mark Wahlberg, aka Marky Mark), an above average hitman facing serious dependency· issues. He works with three fellow associ- ates and together they carry out precision assassinations. As in any good film, their team special- izes in only murderi.!lg extremely important individuals who happen to be guarded by a small guerilla army that slipped by customs and currently resides in a five star ho- tel. This mundane plot, however, could hardly suffice for a two hour feature film. Hence Mel's team, clearly upset with their current sal- ary and health care benefits, de- cides to perform a side operation outside of the organization they work for. Unfortunately, fate deals them a cruel hand when the girl they kidnap turns out to be the godchild of their boss. When Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips), Mel's friend who planned the kidnapping, gets placed in charge of finding those respon- sible it does not take long for him to betray his associates. Mel would probably be worried about the vast numbers ofrnen with sub- machine guns breaking down his front daor, if it weren't for the fact that his fiancee's paFents are in town and his rented copy of King Kong Lives is two weeks overdue. Tomakemattersworse, he fmds himself falling in ;Jove with his kid- napped victim who is skiHed in the erotic culinary arts. lfthis synop- sis sounds ridiculous, imagine pay- ing eight dollars for a copy and then spending two hours reading it. In what is obviously an attempt at a film similar to Grosse Point Blanke, The Big Hit falls drasti- cally short. The dark comedy of Grosse Point Blanke is both cre- ative and witty as it portrays a hitman undergoing a mid-life cri- sis. Everything we enjoy about Grosse Point, however, is every- thing we dislike in The Big Hit. Director Kirk Wong tries to com- bine action with comedy and the result is rather disappointing. Some of the action is intense, but watching Marky Mark (Boogie Nights) break-dance while shoot- ing bad guys just doesn't work. Apparently he is a much more con- vincing pornography star than ac- tion hero. These action sequences are separated by Mel trying to work on his relationship with his fian- cee (Christina Applegate) and im- press her parents. If their accents aren't bad enough, the acting cer- tainly is. Unlike Grosse Point Blanke, The Big Hit has no character develop- ment and everything seems ex- tremely artificial. This not only makes the story even more absurd, but makes the comedy less than humorous. When much of the comedy revolves around mastur- bation and overdue video tapes anyway, it needs all the help it can get. ''The best part of the movie was the commercial for it. We believe this film to b,e a clear case of false advertising.'' It is really hard to enjoy a .film when an enraged viewer stands up and says \this film sucks more than a Hong Kong J~rosti­ tute.\ Avery Brooks (Deep Space Nine, Spen- cer for Hire), how- ever, portrays a convincing head of the organized crime network. In fact, if tllere was one reason to see this film it would be for his perfonnance. The best part of this movie was tile commercial for it. We believe til is film to be a clear case of false advertising. As responsible film critics, we feel it is our duty to give the viewer necessary information to asses~ the validity of certain previews. How many times do pre- views use the phrase \from the pro- ducers of...\ or \from the maker~ of ... \? Statements like these should be an automatic cause for alarm. The definition of\producer\ is the per- son responsible for all aspects of a film including fund-raising, hiring personnel, and distribution. There- fore, we have never understood why the audience should care who the producers are. Obviously films use these phrases to force the viewer to as- sociate the film being advertised with previous successful m<lvies. This habithas become-increasingly popular with modem blockbusters. For example, in how many previews over the last couple years have we heard \from the producers of The R~ck.\ Jerry 'Bruckheimer and Don Sirnpson produced this hugely since uses this slogan. In fact, even the upcoming film Armegeddon useos it. Personally, however, we would rather know who directed a film rather than who raised the money for it. The director is the actual creative genius behind a motion picture. Therefore, we feel the term \.from the director of...\ to be a much more valid statement. Much of the time, the viewer is like-ly to enjoy different movies di- rected by the same person. Mov- iesproduced by the same person, however, will often have nothing in common at all. This was obviously the case with The Big Hit. The television com- mercial has been stating that this film is \from the creativeteam that brought you Broken Arrow and Face Off.\ This statement stems from the fact that director John Woo became famous with the suc- cess of these. two films. These action-packed blockbust- ers certainly attracted a large audi- ence and created a followin,g among action fans f~r Woo's films. So naturally, any film he is involved in mentions those movies in the-ir previews. The problem isthatnow John Woo is producing instead of directing, and his last two produc- tions have been pretty bad. Several months ago The Re- placement Killers was released un- der this slogan and the director was not mentioned at all, probably because no one would recognize the name. The same is true for The Big Hit, everyone knows John Woo but no one has heard of Kirk Wong. So our take home message for this week is don't throw your money away on false advertising, it might tum out to be a big miss. Rating: I'd rather have had my thesis stored on VU.

. j I Arts & E.ntertairimerit Student Bands Battle It Out by Kimberly Rohback A&E Editor However much I would love to write anarticle that tips apart some ridiculous performance I would fear to call art, there will be nothing of that sort this week. I have only go()d things to say about what I saw on Friday at Battle of the Bands. The event was held by the Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior classes in conjunction with the or- ganizers ofEarth Day, Amnesty In- ternational and the Environmental group. As one of the organizers, my goal was to have an event that would give Union College student bands a chance to show their stuff and compete. Just a large and at- tentive audience would have given me pleasure, but it was the quality of music was what impressed me so much. The competition includ~d five of Union's best: The Children, Kim Kilby and Roger Noyes, Sue Skinny and I 1 Inches of Finger Funk, Fools of Ourselves, and The Full Montelles. To begin, each band was amazingly talented, and entertained better than words could ever describe. The Children, made up of Josh Taub, Brian Mitchell, Jeff Hoyt, and Josh Bloom, was the first band to per- form. They put together a great jam session on stage,· ccmplete with raging guitar and killer drums. Although they lacked the organi- zation in musical style, their con- tinuous play was varying and easy to the ear. The next performance featured Kim Kilby and Roger Noyes, two members of a complete band that could not perfonn together for the competition.· The duo delighted though. The sounds of Noyes on his twelve string and Kilby on the mic made for a strong set of music with a taste of folk. The acoustic sounds were refreshing and origi- nal. The next band to perfonn was Sue Skinny and ll Inches of Fin- ger Funk. Band members in- cluded: John 0' Sullivan.·on drums, Max Catillano on lead guitar, and Sue Skinny on bass and vocals. They played a twenty five minute set, and had it not been for time constraints, would have been wel- come to .play more. They placed · more emphasis on their instrumen- tal work. The drums were espe- cially good. The next band, if you could call those two weirdoes a band, was Fools of Ourselves and they cer- tainly did make fools of themselves (just kidding). The crowd loved the fresh musical styling of fresh- men Pat Strong and Seth Madi- soB. The duo performed with painted chests and faces, much to the entertainment of the crowd. Their new hit single \You're Not Laughing at Us, We're Laughing at You\ is sure to make the top of the biHboard charts. The final band to perform was the great \Full Montelles.\ This band was not only last year's sav- ior of Earth Day, but a much ap- preciated performer in this year's contest. They combine humor and musical talent in a way that is not found anywhere else at Union. The Full Montelles started out with a salute to Earth Day. Arya Chowdhury proudly wore the green key chains that Amnesty International handed out for the Earth Day Celebration on bQth of his pig-tails. \It was fabulous and anyene who didn't go sucks\ said Gina LaSorsa of Battle of the Bands. \I found it exciting to see all of these campus bands who would other- wise not be heard. They played under the laws offriendly compe- tition, the laws ofMinerva, and in the spirit of Union College\ said my darling-and articulate co-edi- tor Lori Jill Greene. Thank you to all the bands that participated and all the fans who produced a lovely afternoon filled with sunshine and smooth grooves. · dtnmorhl:ensis • April 30, 1998 • Page 13 · STP's Scott Weiland is Back as is AIC's Jerry Cantrell :IJy Mat Berry WRlJC Music Direct~r s~ott Weiland's 12 Bar Hlues: ,FoF111er lead singer of the Stone Temple Pilots, Scott Weiland, has made a musical comeback with his new solo e~forttitled 12 Bar Blues. . The first radio single off of the disc is \Barbarella a six minute Beatle- like song tl!at sounds much·differ- ent from previous songs he wrote withSTP. \Lady You Bring My Roof Down\ is another song featured on the album. This s~ng had previ- ously been heard on the radio as part-()ftheGreat Expectationsmovie soundtrack. This. album is.by no means a twist This week, we ventured out to Latham to the Dakota Steak House on Troy-Schenectady Road. If you are a vegetarian, beware. The at- mosphere was just charming. All of the furniture was made oat Of pine to add to the rustic ambiance. There was a fireplace accented by authentic southwestern artifacts. The stuffed animals hanging <Jn the wall were abit disturbing, but none- theless fit the theme. Just a bit of advice, reservations and phone ahead seating are avail- able. We had no problem getting seated quickly, but we also went during the week. They also do ban- quets a11d private parties. Just call 786-1234 forinformation. Allma- jor credit cards are accepted and smeking or non-smoking sections are available. I was a little concerned when our dining extrava.ganza began. Laura, ofSTP. It is much mellower than I any SlP record. Take my advice, if you like Scott Weiland's vocals/ lyrics go buy this album, but if you like the grunge sound of STP hold off buying it until you can hear it. B~ggy Depot: Seattle grunge band Alice in Chains has not seen much musical action since their unplugged per- formance of a few years ago. Ob- viously lead guitarist/singer Jerry Cantrell is bored. He recently released his flfst solo CD titled, Boggy Depot. Many of the songs on this album will make you think you are listening to a new AIC album. Cantrell, unlike Weiland, uses many ofthe sounds on Boggy De- pot that he had previously devel- oped with AIC. Songs such as \I takes. [t happens, and we got over it quick:ly. Next, we hit the salad bar. It was pretty good. They had organically grown tomatoes, so that was a plus! Other than that, there wasn't much to say about it. I mean, it was your typical salad bar. All of the vegetables were fresh, and the ranch dressing was tres bon. While we were munch- ing on our delicious greens, Laura brought out a fresh loaf of hot multi-gra.in bread. It was great! Finally, our entrees arrived. I ordered the petite top sirloin for $11.95, and Miss Kimberly Rohback ordered the chicken teriyaki for $12.50. Both dinners included a baked potato. My steak was delicious. Cut YON In and Keep the Lights On\ remind one of AIC. New songs such as Settling Down and Cold Piece shed light on Cantrell's piano playing skills, moving away from the Seattle grunge sound. Overall this album is a decent ef- fort. I would encourage any AlC fans to purchase this CD. If you want to hear more of the album look for CantreH to be touring with Metallica and Days of the New this summer. Catch you next week with some more incite on the music world! is available for $11.95. Also avail- able are a variety of steaks and sea- food, including salmon, trout, and shrimp. Most entrees ranged from $9.95-18.95. Allentrees include the salad bar, bread, and a potato. Confused about how to order your steak? Don't worry about it, be- cause Dakota offers a handy little chart that does it for you! Overall, this was a very positive dining experience. I would defi- nitely go back again. The service very efficient (aside from the drink incident) and the setting was aes- thetically pleasing and enjoyable. Before I forget, Dakota does offer a fine selection of desserts and al- coholic beverages. ~~~ our lovely waitress, forgot to bring It was very tender and had a good flavoring to it. I tasted a hint of some spices, but it wasn't too spicy or overpowering. Kim en- joyed her chicken somewhat as well. We did not get a chance to try either because we were too full and not legal. The prices for desserts ranged from $2.50 for Ben and Jerry's ice cream to $4.50 for their \famous\ mud pie. I would highly recommend the Dakota Steak House for any fish or meat lover. For you meat haters, we'll try to pick a restaurant that is conducive to your dining needs for next week.

The key to winning the second game was held in the hands of juniors Pete Casola and Chris Frazer, sophomore Seth Potkin and freshmen Mahi Mahi, Mike Pigpank, Chris Vietor, Andy Smith, and Alan Gershowitz, who were fresh off the bench to replace t h e tired players from game o n e .

Ultimate Struggle: Union Confronts Tough Competition at Ithaca Tournatnent by David Brooks Staff Writer !his past Sunday, Union's Ultirnate team participated in their third tournament nf the spring season at Ithaca C()llege. At stakes were qualifYing spo1s for a series of UPA (Ultimate Players Association) playoff tournaments that eventually lead to Nationals. Union faced two very tough teams -- RPI, wh icil is ranked hi the top 30 of the nation, and SUNY Binghamton, another experienced team. Despite solid efforts, Union fell to both ( 13-3 and 13-4, respectively). The cold, rainy conditions seemed to symbolize the struggles of the young team, whose members were Mike lger, Sean Spindler- Ranta, Ed Lallier, Brian Goldberg, Aaron Braunstein, Adam Angle, Dave Northup., Alex Bartholomew, Ross Guida, and Siraj Bhadsavle. There were a few vety memorable drives -- one score against RPI took only seconds thanks to smart passing -- but as many passes slipped out of their hands as teammates slipped in the mud. On a positive note, Union was ranked 9th out of 14 teams, which is very respectable for a young team. Union Ultimate has two more tournaments this season, where they will be facing some of the top teams in the nation.

.. Sports 0Jnnc.orbitu£St~ • April 30, 1998 • Page 17 Union Crew Sweeps Hamilton, Bringing Home First Annual Gilman Cup by Aileen Quigley Staff Writ~r The men and women of Union crew took home the first annual Gilman Cup this weekendaftertak:- ingfirst place against Hamilton in all events. Varsity rower Molly Shaner summed the sentiments of her l.'eammates ·and coaches best, stating, \It w:as a clean sweep, and h' s about time.'' The key to any good competi- tion .is a worthy· opponent. Row- ing at both Union and Hamilton dates back to the late 1800s, the height ofthe collegiate crew scene. Along with schools like Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth,.rowers back then established the rivalries and competitive spirit that have been carried on by the athletes of each generation. The Gilman Cup signi- fies, in the words of Head Coach Tom White, \the creation of a tra- dition between long-standing ath- leti-c competitors· like Union and Hamilton.\ The cups were recently donated by Mr. Lawrence Gilman' 63, who was present on race day to witness the victory ofhisalma mater. Dur- ing his years atUnion,crewwasn't even available to the students. He has since joined the Saugatawk Rowing Club in Connectkut, and his enthusiasm for rowing prompted his offer to sponsor a cup in celebration of the competi- tiveness of collegh1te crew. He also joined Friends of Union Rowing (FoUR), the network of alumni that ~romotes funding, organizes sup- port, and encourages participation in rowing at Union. As a result of such enthusiasm Lacrosse continued from page 14 allowed them to settletheir pace. The Dutchwomen h()wever, did n.ot let down, regardless of their lesser opponent. Kittleman continued her strong play, leading the team with six goals. Giving her support to the team, Abbey Harris had four goals !lnd four assists. The fmal score was 19-12, and this victory placed Union second in the UCAA final standings, as well as tying a college record for victories. The last week for the Dutcbwomen has been very busy, and they deserve a break, but they wont get onejustyet. Itisnoteasy playing 4 games in seven days, with one day of practice in- between. Not only did the Dutchwomen play this past Monday, but they received a bid to the state tournament. According to their coach, only eight teams make the field, and they are fifth. The team faces Skidmore. who was their only loss in the UCAA division. However, Coach Linda Bevelander feels they will beat the team. \We are very cap-able of beating them, that was the game that we played awful,\ Bevelander stated. However, this team is not tht~ same team that faced Skidmore two weeks ago. This team is n<>W morelocused, an.d the dedication CJf alumni like men, victoriousagainstHobart last to coxswain Jen Tobin. \The nov- Gihnan, rowing isbtck in full force weekend, carried oyer this same ice,\ she stated, \can only be de· and here to stay. determination and tenacity. scribed as powerhouses.\ Novice In the name oftradition, Union They crossed the line in just over rower Christine Vines was very and Hamilton carne fac:e to. face on seven minutes, beating Hamilton proud of their efforts, \We worked the cold waters ()f the Mohawk and ~oving one step closer to- very hard this season and have earlySundaymoni:ing,eachdeter- wards claiming the Gilman Cup. come a long way in such a sllort mined to be the first to put their Rob Hoppenfeld,commented, \by time.

The The novice women's eight then pulled to the line, nervous but ex- cited. This was their first race against a novice boat not stacked with varsity rowers. With the 1 play- ing field now leveled, their collec- tive, focused energy fueled the powerful defeat of the Hamilton crew. Working as a single unit, they rowed 36 strokes per minute for viJ,tually the entire race, according swain of the \A\ boat stated \we , ' had a great start and there w.as no way we were going to let them touch us after that.\ Hamilt<ln was close on the bow of the \lf\ b()at, though several strategic m()ves by Union pushed them ahead. Arwen Temple and Kelly Houle concurred, affirming that, \despite a difficult start, the middle ofthe race itself was steady and strOllg. It felt greatto beat them.\ The fmal races sealed Union's triumph over Hami'lton. The var- sity men pulled up to the line even with Hamilton, only to leave them struggling to catch up f.or the rest ofthe race. Union crews finished injust over6minutes, their perfor- mance signifying the commitment to excellence they had set for one another and for their competitors. Jay Pyo proudly stated, \it was the fastest race we've ever rowed this season. Hopefully, we can do it again at States in the JV race.\ When the races were finished, Union coaches and captains were presented with the Gilman Cup and the Gilman Ladies Plate to commemorate these victories. Mr. Gilman also placed medals around the necks of the women's and men's \A\ boat. These rowers were Jen Brady, Kenley Smith, Katie Ott, Susanna Ryan, Sarah Retersdorf, Naemah Tan, Sue Zelnick, and Molly Shaner, as well as Steven Eichfeld, John Poor, Mike Sherwood, Rob Hoppenfeld, Mark Morse, Jason Monnell, Nicholas Papanickolas, and John Carbone. Overall, Head Coach Tom White felt that \the perfonnance and at- tention to detail was really what epitomized the say. Mistakes were kept to a minimum, and the crews executed as planned.\ In the years to come, the cups may change hands, but the tradition of com- petitive racing will undoubtedly re- main constant. The men's and women's teams are currently pre- paring for the state championships which are going to be held at Lake Delta in Rome, .New York. and puts in theextraetfort in every game. \You can n()t ask anyone for more than the BEST that they have to give. Theyare,giving 150% each time they stop 011 that field,\ says Bevelander. Baseball Stays Where They Are Having a .500 Week The Dutchwomen just wrapped up their season this past Monday, facing Hamilton. Theteam moved on to a 17-5 victory, without looking one bit tire(f, ()r showing any signs of fatigue. The first half of the game belong~tdsolely to the Dutchwomen,. tllei:r lead into the half was 8-l. I caug.htthe most part ofthe half from a -window in Bailey Hall, unfortunate:!y it was the Dutchwomen 's goad. It was a very rue occasion to see the ball at thai end. Goalie Woessner did not e'Ven look tested thus far. As for tlte second half, Union continued to play strong, but let back just a :Jittle. At the clos-e of the season, Union is second in the UCAA, and is 9-4 .overall. The Dutchwomen now move into the postseason facing fourth ranke<l Skidmore. Skidmore is the sde reason for these statistics. Had Union Vion against Skidmore, the roles would be reversed, but regar<lless the issue is now avenging the loss. The Dutchwomen are .c.11rrently on an eight game winning :streak, and take this momentum and .confidence into the postseason. by David Weiner StajfWriter After rallying in the previous weeks to drastically improve their record, the Swinging Dutchmen could not continue in their recent success as they could only muster three wins coupled with three losses this week. While the Dutch- men did score anum ber of runs and fqund a number of players perform- ing well, they could not pull out a two close games against St. Lawrence after easily ~weeping Clarkson and splitting a double header with Hamilton. Hamilton 18- Union 3 This was not the manner in which the Dutchmen were hoping to pegin their final week of action as they came out flat and were com~ pletely dominated by a powerful Hamilton team. In the frrst game of this double header, Hamilton found ·themselves leading 10-3 after three innings and then padded their lead with four more runs in both the fifth and seventh innings. The only positives in this disappointing game were Jeremy Lamb and Brett ·'' .' Zani, who both recorded tw<J hits. Union 6- Hamilton 3 After total obliteration in the first game, Union bounced back to win the back end of the double header. Riding a solid six inning pitching performance by Ryan Almstead followed by one inning of sl1Ut out baseball by closer David Kline, the Dutchmen were able to hang on f<Jr the win. Kline recorded his sev- enth save ofthe season as the team was powered by Ryan Smith's double, single, and two runs scored along with Lamb's two singles and two rbi's. Union 11- Clarks01, 3 Union 22- Clarkson 12 This was a high scoring double header that found the Union bats producing well. Almstead had himself a career day as he drove in eight runs with five singles, a triple, and a double. Ryan Smith and Jer- emy Pflaum each had five rhi' s as Smith recorded three singles and two doubles while Pfluam did his damage with six consecutive singles. St. Lawrence 1- Union 1 St. Lawrence 3- Union 1 This is a double header Union would love to forget or replay. The Dutchmen had leads in both ends of this match-up, but somehow blew the lead in each game. In the opener, Josh Soldo pitched beau- tifully, allowing a mere six hits, but had his game spoiled as he allowed two runs in the fourth inning. The Union bats were unusually quiet in the game as they could only muster one run. In game two, the Saints scored in the bottom half of the seventh inning, thus ruining a wonderful performance by junior Craig Kazmierczak. Erik Kopka drove in two runs in the sixth inning, but those runs were not enough to hold the lead and post a victory. With this .500 week, the Union record improved from 12-11 to 15- 14, thus not really changing the teams standing in UCAA play. With only a few games remaining in the season, the Dutchmen must rally back from this week and win the rest of their games to keep the remote possibility of playoff com- petiti.on alive.

Page 18 • April 30, 1998 • aroncar.mett!'lt5 St:. Pat:rick 0 by Christopher G. Leone Editor-in-Chief It is NBA playoff time md by the time this article actually gets published the New York Knicks will be in one ofthree predicaments. They will have either lost handily, pull off a great upset, or still be battling the Miami Heat. No matter what the outcome, the time has come for the retirement of Patrick Ewing.. Unless you spent the past winter on Mars, and did not get the recent NBA news from Marvin the Martian, Patrick Ewing spent the better part of this season on the disabled list with tom ligaments in his right hand. When Ewing was injured against the Milwaukee Buclcs, the Knicks were still contenders and only trailing the Heat by a handful of games. However the loss of Ewing did not kill the Knicks and doom tilem into the seventh playoffspot, tied with the New Jersey Nets. The Knicks were competitive without Ewing and only fell below being a .500 team after the losses <JfCJn:is Dudley to a broken foot. Coupled with the Dudley loss Buck Williams, Larry Johnson, Charles Oakley, and John Starks have all missed time due to injuries. The 1998 Knicks were n\Ot a. bad team or a disappointment because they finished seventh. If anything they were unfortunate that the other injuries plagued them Shootin Alan Gordon Becoming S()lid Closer Red Sox Need Coming into the season, the Red Sox had many question marks, but their biggest concern was whether or not they would have a reliable closer. This past off-season, in hopes of adding a fonnidable closer, the Red Sox signed washed up veteran, Denn1s Eckersely. Five years ago, Red Sox fans would have been drooling at the opportunity to watch the Eck pitch in a Red Sox unifonn again. However, at the age of 43, fans couldn't help but ask why, when they signed Eckersely in the offseason. Eckersely, to nobody's surprise other than Red Sox management, has disappointed, but first year closer, Tom Gordon, has made fans forget about the Eck's troubles. Gordon, who moved into the closing role at the end oflast season and saved I I out of 13 chances, was angered by the signing of Eckersely. However, he was given the .opportunity to prove his worth to the ballclul> and he hasn't disappointed. Gordon, like Eckersely, had been a starter for much of his career, but began struggling. In hopes of reviving a once promising career, Gordon decided t<J try out his luck in the bullpen. With a strong fastball, and Gordon's tendency to have success early in ball games, the move seemed Houston has thrived in the absence of the power hungry, ball demanding, Ewing. The 1997 free agent pick up has developed into an ali-star shooter and a cornerstone, along with guard Charlie Ward, for this team to build. Johnson, despite some injuries to his arm, is still young and a solid player without Ewing in the lineup. Johnson gets the ball and is allowed to create with the seven foot center missing. Oakley, who has filled in as center during the big- mans absence, has done an admirable job and plays a more physical game typical for the current NBA. lt could be argued that if Ewing was to leave there would be no true center on this team. While this is true, Ewing's retirement would secure a great deal of salary cap room for the Knicks to chase logical. His success at the end oflast season prompted the Sox to sign him to a two year $7.5 million deal to be the Red Sox closer. However, nobody expected Gordon to be closing games for a first place team and be second in the league in saves as April winds down. With Gordon's early success, the Red Sox have been able to win the one run games . that HeathcliffSiocumb and other former Red Sox closers could not. Slocumb has gone on to blow games for the Mariners, while the Red Sox enjoy life at the top of AL East behind their newly established closer, Tom Gordon. Sele leads trio of Texas Starters Aaron Sele, once thought to be Roger Clemens successor in Boston, h~s never lived up to the hype that surrounded him early in his career. After winning his first six games as a rookie, Sele fmished the year 7-2. However, in the years following his rookie season, Sele's record was a disappointing 3 I -31 and the Red Sox gave up on him this past offseason. Apparently, a trade that sent Sele along with catcher Bill Hasselman, to the Texas Rangers, for catcher Jim Leyritz and outfielder Damon Buford, was just what he needed to resurrect his career. Sele has begun this season much like he began his rookie season in Boston. After Sunday's another center. Remember that the Chicago BuHs of the 9G>'s~ and the great Piston teams ofthe late BO':s, \lsed a center by committee lineup. IfEwing were to leave, tile :Knicks could implement the tri-center system with Dudley, Oakley, and Williams. Extra money could secure a110ther pure shooter to join Houston. TFadin.g .away Chris Childs' and John Starks WCJllld free up more money under the cap .a11d tile Knicks . could be contenders for several more years. Yes, the team could contendwith Ewing, but it has gotten old. Every ~arne Ewing demands more shots than aJJyDne else and maybe he deserves it based <>n seniority, but before his injury his skills had started to erode and it is highJy likely they will not improve with age. For Ewing's sake I win against Kansas City, Se[e became the first pitcher this season to wi:n five games. Supported by above average fielding, something he never had in B()ston, Sele has already pitched two shutouts a11d has a 2.00 ERA. Ftuthermore, he has pitched into the eighth inning three consecutive times, a feat he never accomplished in 1'08 starts in Boston. Sele has been helped not only by the Ranger gloves, but by th~ir bats. The Rangers have scored 57 runs f()r Sele in his five outings thus far. Ifthe Rangers continue to support Sele, he will be ju.st another name in the long list of All-Stars tbe Red Sox have traded away. Sele isn't the .only Ranger finding success on the mound this season. Rick Helling and Bobby Witt have also begun the season undefeated. Witt, (3-0) has lost much velocity on his once feared fastball, but he has used his other pitches and fo11nd ways to win. Helling, (4-0) Tex:.as fifth starter, has baffled pitchers by ch,anging speeds. However, with a fastball which reaches only 86mph, it shouldn't be long llefore hitters start knocking Helling aroand. Texas can only hope theii masterfutpitdting continues as they attempt to distance themselves from the pack it} the AL West. Around tlle He~rn In response to Chis Leone's assessments Sports ore l:t0pehe remembers this because the New YoFk fans_ are sick and tired of hearing about championships that should be and never are. As- Mark Anthony said about Julius Caesar, \I come to bury Caesar not to praise him. The evil that men do long ()Utlives them while good is oft interred with their :bones.\ Patrick Ewing, who has worked ruirades for a once struggling franchise, might hear these words and retire before they are stated about him .after it is too late. * * * * * I am really enjoying how Red Sox fans are talking such great amounts of trash. BefoFe·the unveiling ofthis weeks power rankings I leave those beanheads with the following thoughts. While it is a great story, who really believes that Bret Saberhagen is going to last all season at his current pace? Nomar Garciapara is nice, but will have to slump eventually? Jim Leyritz is a Yankee and Mo Vaughn might be one s<>on if not signed. When was the last time Boston was hoisting hardware in October? Keep dreaming Boston! POWERRANKINGS I. New York Yankees 2. San Diego Padres 3. Boston Red Sox 4. Texas Rangers 5. Atlanta Braves * * * * * American league: The Yankees may very well be the team to beat, but how can an)'one predict that Oriole Mike Muss ina's injury is the first in a long line of trouble for Baltimore? Furthermore, how can one suggest that the Cleveland Indians, who defeated the Yankees in the playoffs last year, are a team of damaged goods? Both teams are strong contenders who the YaJJI<ees will have to beat on the field, if they hope to get to the World Series. They will not have the fortune of watching them crumble as a result of injuries which you see pending. Ifthe Yankees win, it will be for the immense talent the team possesses, not for the injury ridden contenders you wishfully prescribe. Player of the Week Mike Piazza C Los Angeles Dodgers After begin.ning the season in a miserable slump resulting from adverse contract negotiations, Piazza has once again returned to MVP form. The Dodgers have won four out of their last five and Piazza has carried them. He has upped his home run total to eight on the year and has brought his average back above .300. Piazza's ~arly slump, coinciding with the Dodgers slow start, prove that as Piazza goes, so go the Dodgers. COME INTO MOTO PHOTO FOR SUPER SAVINGS!
