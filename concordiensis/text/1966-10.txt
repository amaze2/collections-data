His e~ection to the S.C. Presidency leaves vacant the· seat on the All- College Council to which he was elect- e:i last April. A quef!ltron as rto the method to be used in filling this seat was iffilTiediately raise-d and referred to a speci-al committee. Other Condidates In addition to Volinsky, those nom- inated were Robert Winner, '67, Mike Berlowitz, '68, and Willard Grant, '67. Those voting were the 15 student council representatives from the three upper classes, >the three upper- class presidents, and the chairman of the .student Tax Committee. Also attending were abO<ut 15 or 20 stu- dell!ts. The final vote was Volinsky 12, Winnel' 4, and Berlowitz 3. On the second ball-ot Volinsky had 9, one shoxt of the majority 11e-eded and Winnel' • and Berlowitz wcee tied with 5 each_ The vote on the first ballot was· Volinksy 7, Wiml!er and Berlowitz 5 _ each, and Grant 2. G1•ant was d1'opped as the lowest candidate. The tie be- ·tween Ber1owitz and Wi'llner pre- vented a run-off b&tween the top two candid!lJtes. When the second vo-te left Volinsky one shy of the required 10 for a majority, a five-minute recess was • called. Three swit~hes in votes gave him the required majorLty. .the Student Council, making it pos- sible f.or any group to ·spo·IISor Sat- urday entertainment, and of having a student booking agent as a non• voting member of the tax committee i~ contact witJl the city- booking agen- Cles.

After the election, the other can- didates pledged support for Volinski. Mike Berlowitz said \I am pleased to see a lot of mterest generarted and I hope this intereest w.ill be .carried over.\ Bob Winn-er staU!d that he was pleased w~th the result, though nO<t as pleased as if he had been elected. He felt rthat VoHnski would do a dy- namic job. \Gnat or Gadfly\ Grant, another candidate. said that his political future W()Uld be as good as any \gnat or gadfly on c.ampu:s.\ Before the election, .speeches were made by each candida:te and hy the person who nominated him. The IVom- inrution speech was limited to three minutes and the candidlttes• speech to five minutes. A five minute question and answer period followed each address. Ben Volinski was nom-inated by \Doc\ Benjamin; M·organ \.Skip\ Eames nominated Bob Winner; Mike Be<rlowitz was nominated by Paul Costello and Willard Grant by Steve Yohay.

Harold Mal'tin's bid for a more even level o:f social activjty at the college, Steve Ritterbush, PI·esi- den.t of the Class of '.68, said Monday. '['here will be no definite Fall Week- en<! this year according to I,arry Pedowitz, President ()f the -class of '69. ln&tead, Nov. 4-5 vlill be the first so- cial weekend featll!'ing only one con- cert on Nov. 5. The weekend will be s.p()nsored by the class of '69. Another weekend is tentatively scheduled for No\. :19, b11t a sponsor has not been fo~Xnd.

One-Day Events ]3(}th Ritterbush and R<>bert Ben- jamin, President of the class of '67, str-es·sed that weekends in the past llne grown too big for the good C?f 'the student body, from an acadenuc and financial standpoint. Ritterbush said it was com:;;non to lay out $15,000 ior one weekend and just as c<>mmon to ic>se up to $2POD as did the class ()f '67 last spring- First Job Afte1· the election, Volinski said \My fir.st job is to .see Dean L1>ckwo.od and have <the faculty members of the All-College Council selected.\ DelphicsMove To Better In troducing his subject, he po-inted out that \Here has been something chaotic, dramatic, ct>mpelling, and completely understandable, which has been recognized as a full-blown ex- pres'Sion of everything wrong with the world up Ulltil that time.\ From there, Mr. Frankel took his audience on a fascinating tour of the maneuvering, elbow-twisting, and even idealism involved in the . two affairs. .Ritterbush said ·a ticket cha1·ge of ~8-$9 per student is needed to sup-port big weekends on su<=h a small campus as ()Urs. He feels that the smal1er, more frequent Vv-eekends a1·e better 'Suited to Union. He also appointed an election com- mittee -to combat apathy and to ill· vestigate methods of election for the new A.C.C. members: The commitwe consists of Bob Marshall, Frank Me- Kim, and Marty Pit1son. QuesbiollS weTe raised as .to whether freshmen should be allowed. to vote and also if the Student Council should elect the representative. Convocation Attitudes War Pact Asserting that \history is the first cousin of irony,\ the correspondent pointed ()Ut that, 11 0n the very night that Hvngarian youth ga.thered for what became the ·start of the Hun- - garian Revolution; the leaders of France, Great Bi'itain, and Israel signed what was really a war pact.\ \With the )Jeginning of the new ac-ad-emic cul'ricula, the 3 ()1' 4 day .blovrout puts a sevel'e strain on stu- dents/' said Robert Benjamin. He also poted faculty resentment of the big weekends resalting from the weak co-ndition of many s.tudell!ts on the M-<Onday after. A proposal to have the Student ·Council itself sponsor entertainment on November 19th will also he investi- gated by a special committee. . (• Nominat-ing Speech In his nomination speech, Volinski thought it \wi-se to get away from the very extrava-gant weekends\ and to stretch them out. Other proposals concerned the questions of having the IFC and IRC re}lresentatives sit on Th-e Delphic Society hatS begun a campaign to crack down on miscon- duct at convocations. At a meeting called by Delphic President John Geer, the society dis- cussed actions -that could be taken against &tudents who are found guilty of such ill conduct.

Each of the 16 fratem1ties :h,as 2 represent~ilives im •bhe IFC. They elect a 5 man judicial boa-rd which emorces rushing ·and social rules. An inf1·h1ge- ment of the rushing rules may me.an the forefeitimg of a fraternity's rush- ing pri:vileges, the forfei-ting <Jf the freshman's rushing privileges,. and/ or a fine of $250. A primary goal of the IFC is te re- organize seasonal weekends. JFC president Hunter Lewis would like to see more weekends, on a smaller scale than former seasonal weekend-s. It is hoped thaJt this can be remedied by scheduling top notch entel\ta.iners on three of f.our weekends per teNn. Although the rushing period has been shortened from twelve to ;nime week.s due to lthe tri..,semester, ib is believed that the fr.eshmen wiH still have adequate time to decide Qll 1!. fra- ternity. A shorber rush period' also lessens ·the financial burden of .the fraternities by eliminating a number of parties. •that would otherwi.se be needed during the rushing program.

And then it be- comes yours forever. It is your voice. It is your heart beat.\ Archie Sbepp wrote .the above statement. He is one of the more musically talented as well as vocally articulate of the new musician's. His views about the Negro',s relationship with white society have proven to be very unpopular with many people. They write Shepp off as a racist without having ever heaxd any of his music. Anger Not Hate However, if people would just listen to Shepp's music, it is conceivable ·that their opinion of the man might change. It is true that the man's music shows his anger towards many whites. No- body is denying that. But Shepp's anger i:s not hatred. And he isn't angry with all whites. If he were, why would tw<> fifths: of his group be white? Shepp's music is usually raw naked power. He wails, screeches, and snorts with his instrument. The man is conveying the frustration that he, a Negro, has experienced in white America. A good example of such pLaying is \Scag\ from the al.bum New Thing At Newport (Impulse).. Shepp bullie's the listener into either acceptance of his music or complete rejee:tion. There is no middle ground. One shouldn't get the false impresion, however, that there is only the angry side of Shepp. On the contrary, he is apt to be a romanticist a.t times. Listen to his reC(Hding of Duke Ellington's \Prelude to A Kiss\ fl'om Fire Music (Impulse). Here is Shepp when he is calm. Although his· ~ · tone is still slightly harsh, lyricism is quite evi- dent in his playing. Shepn sings of his dreams and hopes. He, too, would like to reap all the benefits that white America enjoys. And he right- fully feels that he is entitled to them. All Blues John Coltrane. What .shall I. say of the man?

If one considers the objective of the Newport Folk Festival to ·be the definite production on the current folk scene,. then it failed miserably. The An informal gathering watches one of the many workshops at the Newport Folk Festival. evening concerts were dominated by many obscure performers and the accent on the traditional folk spectrum w11-s heavy. Big names .such as Peter Paul and Mary, Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, were made conspicuous by their ~b'sence. Many of the currently popular city performers such as Tom Rush and Eric Ander- sen performed only at daytime workshops. worl{S such as \San Francisco Bay Blues.\ Hav- ens pl~y,s all his songs in open tunings (open E, E;:. ·seve.n,, and E mino.r). By changing the tempoes and making some subtle changes in the melody, Havens produces a truly unique sound, He performed around the Vil- lage for Heveral years but, until recently, was un- recorded. His popularity is highest with ·the \in circles\ of £otk music, but it is hoped that New- port will give him the impetus to become more wide'ly known. It is unfortunate that he wasn't exposed to more peo]Jle at the evening programs. New Face Another new face to many was Tim Hardin. an explusive blues singe1· who recently released his first album. Hardin, who performs mostly orig- inal werk, combines a rich deep voice with un- usl:lally melodic blues songs. The political ·sentiments of the audience ranged from left of cen:ter to left of left of center. This was made clear hy the response to topical singerS, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, and Pete Seeger. The greatest applause of the festival came when Pete Seeger sang a song which stated that \if you like your Uncle Sam, bring back the boys from Viet- nam.\ Sound System The sou·nd system was good but was marred by disorganization and unpro.fessiOI~alism. However, this is to be expected when running four concerts at one time, as during the afternoon workshop sessions. Most of the sta~ing of the evening con- certs was can-:ied off cleanly. The afternoon workshops were originally meant to be small informal gatherings at which per- formers could demonstrate and explain their vari- ous talents. However the magnitude of some of the workshops haS' become such that many are no more than concerts centering around a theme, such as \contemporary music.\ .• J, Some workshops though, such as the one on Movie Review: Communication of Physical Sensation One last not about Coltrane. At least he is able to make so.ine sort of living from his music while other talented musicians have to starve.

For' Firtnness Benjamin Volinski's el~ction to the presidency of the student body hopefully will tbring an end to the unfortunate drift that has characterized it since the start of tne year. Volinski brings to his office a full measure of exper- ience, topped by membership on the Student Tax Commit- tee, the All-College _Council and his position as a Nott Scholar. This latter qualification should preclude the pos- sibility of his following the path of two of his three predecessors. The college is now standing at the cro~sroads between mediocrity and excE;lllence •. The first~ tentative growth has ta:ken root, but it is, as yet, a fragile thip.g. The l~ader of student government should vigorously speak for the stu- dent opinion. He should never be afraid to speak because of fear of adverse reaction, but should actively strive to lead it. Union has long been known as a conservative school. Its student leaders have rarely been willing to speak with firmness and authority oh any but the most obviollS issues. They have often allowed respect for administrators dilute their willingness to oppose them despite private convic- tions. Hopefully, the Volinski administration will provide the s~rength that the student body needs at the top. One issue h~ can attempt, right.at the cnit.set:of his term, is writing new rulei goverri.ihg selection of\the council chairman to prevent th~ aca},~rilif;ally . inspired resignation from be- coming a way of life f(lr student chief executives. - ~ I' ' The letters on this pagt;l indicate that the question of social rules is still a sensitive point on campus. Last week's editorial suggested one possible alternative to the present rules. Although we feel that that outline provides the best framework for the college, we recognize that it is unpop- ular among many segments of the campus. But the Stu- dent Council should provide a continujng forum of opinion on the questi~m of\ the optimum standards. And they should never be . dissuaded from discussing an issue be- cause certain segments of the campus falsely cry \cau- tion\ or refuse to consider differing opinions. cordiensis has done i•t. J:t has banished the platitudes and · eu-phuisms that unfovtunately comprise so many of President Martin's remarks. What we are dealing \Vith here and what we have been dilly-dallying with in the paJ?t is fornication. I must · say that the disguises with which the administrati-on has vei\ed it have often beeon ludicr- ous' But now that the unpe,ak- able has been spoken, i-t is deeply hoped by this writer that there will he ·an understanding on this campus, as there should be everywhere, ·that number one, above .all other classifications with their legal, moral and reasonabl,e \rights we are hu- man beings, and two, we are free.

I ·wish for this reply on no other g-rounds other than the fact that they, like us, are human beings. I~ is time for a dialogue. Kenneth Arthur Kobland '68 Basic Morality Letter to tile Editor: Let me raise two questions comerning last week's edi-toriai entitled \Personal Propriety.\ In the first place, the editor writes with regard to the new s·ocial rules: \We do feel that th<Jy are not the definitive norm::tive standard for this campus for all- time. We feel that they should be debated openly and freely by the colleg-e community.\ Our question is this: were they not deba.ted freely and openly be- fore being adopted, and do they not continue to be debatted? Furthermore, who has ever in- timated that these rules are to be a \definitive normative stand- ard . . . for all time\ ? No spe- cific solution can be ultimate; only basic principles can persist. Again, the edi-tor wriotes: \The present rules limit when women are allowed in the dormitories. We as·sume that the rea&on for this ·is .. , to restrict op.portuni- ties for fornicati-on, , . • a per- sonal matter\ which does not \infringe on the rights of others.\ The editorioal overlooks the fact that such \personal\ matters can infringe upon the rights of the col:ege community as a whole. The colle-ge has a right and more than a rig;ht- an obligation-to defend its -good name, its decency. I am convinced of more than this. The \personal matter,\ which the ti.tJe of the editorial classifies as an issue of propri- ety, extends beyond propriety, or convention, to basic morality. It has roots that are deeper than mere manners. Norman B. J·ohnson Departme'llt of Classics 1966,) you ask the faculty '00. take a s·tand on certain ques- tions regarding the propriety of the coHege placing restrictions on the private and personal lives of the individuals who are stu- dents here. This is one faculty member's stand: The decision to abstain or in- dulge ~n fornication is hardly personal or private. Society -says that you sha:l not! All religions say that you shall not! If So- ciety was concerned about you only, the answer would still be the same, But Society also cares about the bastards you pmcre- ate, the daughters and wives that you viola-te. Are you familiar with the so- cial r11les to which the faculty I?ust adhere? They .are not pu-b- lished in the Faculty Manual. They do not have to be! They are obvious. Those who run the college would not think of in- su.ltil?g our intelligence by re- mmdtng us of them. Commit• ting f-ornication is cove1·ed by -the ·express!o11 \moral turpi- tude.\ F~or faculty members -the punishment for guilt is di-smi.s. sal. (it may also mean that the guiiity party will never teach again.) . The thing that surprises me 1s the fact that some of you stu~ de;nts do not seem to realize this. Where have you been lo these seventeen (.or more) year~ of your life? Would you have me presume that you come from parents that axe adulterous? When you write that 'fthis newspaper (I assume you mean the editor) neither advocates nor condemns fornicwtion\ it :;ounds as if you are either 1gnorant or wjthout principles. In fact, it is just equivocation as far as I am concerned: you really mean that you are for fornication .. Why do you not say so? Take a stand :for goodness sake! In the hopes that you will not accuse me of equivocation, may I say that r condemn illicit sexual intercourse in all i•ts forms; fornication, adultery, and any other nrun·e that you may call it. At fit'st I intended to glve reason ft>r my stand, but I have thought better of it. So many writer.s have stated the ease so well that I shall not even try. Apparently many of ·bhe more valuable a~udeuts have eom- pletely mi-sunderstood President Mavtin. I shall stand eorre ·ted leader <Jf men in the profession of arms.

Please, Mr. Editor, can we not now turn 1>Ul'· atte-ntion to more im- porta.p.:t !itl'eas \Vithin 'the college comm.Jinfty \? .

You prom- ised us to do this! On your honor! What's this bit about the rules being framed to inhibit f Jt·nication? You are not going to do this anyway! '.1 '' What I do nat understand is why you will not go all the way. Why do you not beg for an honor system? I, for one, be- lieve that you students could hand'e the excesses in the fl'a- ternities and dormitories much better than we can..

NEWPORT FOLK FESTIVAL Page 3 Concordy Sports LANGUAGE LABORATO.RY Page 5 Gridders Tie Mariners; Mcfarlane Knots Continentals Joe James Tallies For Only Garnet Score Union withstood a strong second half comeback by heavily-favored Kings Point to hold the Mariners to a 7-7 tie last Sat- urday. The game, played in a steady down- pour, was not decided until the final 1 :25 of ;play when a field goal attempt by Kings Pomt quarterback Hanford was short of the mark. Union almost scored the first time they had the ball. Taking the ball on their own 30, the Garnet moved the ball to the Kings Point 1 before being stopped. Throughout the first half, Union was able .to move the hall well behind the strong run- ning of Jim Ramich and Joe James. It was not until the second quarter that the Gamet scored their first touchdo\'Vll of the year, however. Midway through the quarter the Garnet marched 58 yards to score and ta:ke a 7-0 lead. The key play of the drive was an 18 yard touch- down run by fullback James behind the blocking of Fusick and Smith. Kings Point threatened several time's dul'ing the first half but was hurt by two fumbles deep In Union territory. !Kings Point dominated the second half as the Garnet were unable to move the ball past mid- field. Union took the second-half kickoff and was fOirced to punt after three running plays netted six yards. Kings Point took the ball from their own 36 to the Union 20 before a fumble halted the drive. The only bright spot for Union in this Mlf came thereafter when Utecht hit Ramich with a:short pass on a third and 18 from the Union 26 1 • Ramich slipped two tackles and almost got away before being hauled down on the Union 40. .The Mariners' scoring march started m1dway in the third quarter after a Union quick kick. Taking the ball on their own 40 Kings Point stayed mostly on the ground and moved well. The An End of an Era It was with great regret and pain that Red Barber, sportscaster of the New York Yankees, was fired by Michael Dunn, the new Yankee presi- dent. This action by the \CBS Yankees\ has now begun an era in broadcasting. Red Barber has been the· representative of mil- lions of Yankee fans for 20 years. His warbling, southern accent oecame a part of the Yankee dynasty; however, one must realize that Mel Allen was fired .by the Yankees during their champion- ship years. Why then is Red Barber's dismissal so import- ant'/ It has been unusually obvious that the major networks, in an attempt to increase the·ir audi- ence, have hired many ex-athletes to help with the broadcasting and the \color\ of ma·ny sports events. Among these new .sportscasters are Frank Gifford, Tom Harmon, Joe Garagiola, and Pee Wee RE*'sf'. They are all eminently qualified in their field of sports, and they certainly aid in the laymen'.s understanding. They have also been well trained in voice control, in diction, and exclama- tion. Aithough these men will add a great deal to the listeners' perception of the game, their rise t() the forefront of broadcasting has added a great amount of mechanics while limiting the warmth and emotional quality of the s·port. It may be interesting to note that it has been l'umored amongSit those in broadcasting that the present broadcaster of the Saturday college foot- ball games will be soon wi 1 thout a job and that Terry Brennan, former Notre Dame coach, will fill his vacancy. With a fear- that spor,ts may soon become aca- demic rather than enjoyable, it is hoped that the major nf:'tworks will review their policy. A compromise between these two qualities of sports broadcasting will certainly add to the laymen's enjoyment, whiie a one .. sided outlook will cer- tainly call for the end of an era. fullback Sullivan took it in from the one with 1:30 left in the quarter. Early in the fourth quarter Kings Point moved to the Union 35 after Union gambled and lost on a fourth down play in their own territory. Here the Mariner'S were halted as Hanford was thrown for a loss attempting to pass, and Sullivan was unable to gain through the middle of the Union line. On a fourth down play Ramich intercepted a Hanford pass. Aided by a personal foul against Kings Point, Union moved to their own 46. Utecht hit Ramich with a screen pass, but Ramich fum- bled when hit on the 49. The Mariners then moved 31 yards in 11 plays aided by two fine runs by Sebuck on fou1'th down situations. With a fourth down and five on the Union 19, Hanford's field goal attempt failed. Al- though the ball changed hands twice in the last minute, neither team was able to threaten seri- ously. Hanford, who was touted before the ga!Ile as an outstanding passer, completed 9 of 15 but was never able to complete a long pass in the second half The fine play oj' Ramich and DeMond in covering the deep receivers and the pressure the Union line put on Hanford in the fourth quarter were mainly responsible for this. Frosh Gridders To Face Trinity By LEN SIMON The freshman football team opens its season to- morrow in a home game with Trinity. Coach Bruce Allison has high expectations for this year's squad which he calls, \an eager and ambitious group.\ The squad numbers 45 and Coach Allison hopes to use as many boys as possible in each game, but the following are those who should see most of the action. At center will be Bill Birns, flanked by offensive guards Bill Muhly and Skip Lynch. One offensive tackle will be John Burton, and the other will be ei'ther Andy Anderson, Al Kelley, or Bill Dwyer. The offensive end positions will be manned by Tom Godfrey and Kevin Monahan. The quarterbacking dUJties will be held by either Scott Kumpf or Ken Pearce. Halbacks will be either Dick Swan, Tom Leahy, or Craig C.,arlson, and the fullback will be Vern Syverson. When not in possession of the ball the frosh will use a 5-3, 3 deep defense. At def·ensive ·end.s will be Burton and either Monahan or Frank Felts. At tackles will be Dwyer and Kelley. The line will be shored up by middle guard Lynch. Muhly will be one of the linebackers, with the other two chosen from among Paul Malsky, Russ Ciccotti, John Duffy, and Ed Valentine. Steve Ciesinski, Fran Piscitelli, and Mary Martland now rate the edge in the battle for defensive backfield positions, but Steve Bauer, Dave Gray, and Jim Sabella are aloo in contention for the tl:wee spots. Ideally, Coach Allison would like to start 22 men, or two separate platoons. He hopes to move toward this goal during the season. His only prob- lem has been inadequate time to practice and or- ganize his team. After opposing the Trinity frosh, the Garnet have away contests against Rochester and R.P.I. later this m<mth.

Hamilton had taken a 3-Q lead just 2 minutes earlier. The Garnet started strong, completely con- trol'ling play during the first half and taking a 2-0 lead. Dick Amesbury tallied for Union in the first pe1·iod while Ting Pau Oei added a second period g()al. The Garnet seemed to \run out of gas\ in the second half as Hamilton scored sing·le goals in the third and fourth periods. An injury to senior captain Greg, Olson early in the second half ham- pered the Garnet effort. Play was fairly even dur- ing the 2 ·ov·ertime periods, the first of which was scoreless. Coach Evans cited Greg Olson and Toby Olson for their fine play but felt that the entire team needed bet.ter conditioning. The Garnet's next encounter wHl be tomorrow at home against Al- fred at 3 o'clock. Draft Test '70 Booters Win; • fBard Sched1-tled ·lu The Fres.hman se>.ccer te~m opeEed. its seas(}ln Monday with an ImpressiVe 6-1 victory over Northwood. Ce·nter-forward Jim Jennings st;~ppl1ed the offensive spark for the Garnet frosh with three goals and. au assist. In addition to Jenning's scoring, Tim Bitting, Mike Patters<:m, and Dane Gleason scored for the Garnet with assists from Doug DuVal and Martin Carey. The Garnet f1•ont line, led by Jennings, played only three periods and controlle-d the ball so well th<Jt Northwood got just one shot at Union's goal. Out£,banding em 'the defense were ce-nter halfback Brian Gi'llie and fullback B()b MacKenzie. The frosh hooters travel to Bard for the.i:r next ·ame Saturday.

According to Ben Volinski, the decision was made to hold a campus-wide election rather than to have the student council elec- ·tion after talks with members of a special c0mmfttee and members of the A.C.C. Committee Approves Eledion A temporary committee, consisting of Bob Maorshall, Marty Pinson and Frank McKim, was set up at the :first student ca·uncil meeting to investigate the .pos·sible ways of electing another student representative at la1•ge. None of the committee members or A.C.C. members had any violent objections to a campus-wide election and some wGre ve1•y enthusiastic about dt. I Many reasons exist for an all-cam- pus election. If another election were held in the Student Council, the cam- pTI's might object that elections are entirely closed to the bulk of the stu- dent body. Any member of the stu- dent body may now run, subject to the approval of the board set up in the ACC charter. · Appeal to Freshman The freshman class will be exposed early to campus affairs, ami it is hoped that this class will take an ac- tive interest and become intelligently informed.

To Decide Brown Cup Award Date Dean 0. Edward Pollock announced Tuesd.ay that he \doesn't known when or where\ the Stephen P. Brown Tro- phy will be awarded thi:s year. He said tha:t ·the fra'bernity pesidents -would like him to present the award at the football game this S!l!turday but thai he thinks that awarding the trophy at a rootball game is \a horrible idea.\ Annual Award The Stephen F. Brown Trophy is awarded annually to the frruternity which excels in three areas: scholar- ship, ill!tramural athletics, and par- tici'pa:tion and leade.mhip in campuos extracurricular activities. The three areas are asses·sed on the basis of a point system. In case of a t:e, the fraternity wi•th the most pcbts in the activities and lea,der- ship a,re::t will receive the award. Prizes Eliminated The trophy was originally given to the college by Phi Sigma Delta Fraot3rn:ty. Until several years .ago the award was preosented annually at the opening convocation, but in order to shorten that convocation, all presentations and award were cut out and transferred to other times. Dean Pollock is currently dete.rm- ining- the winner of the award. Dan Button, area candidate for congress, gives an exclusive report on his recent mission to Vietnam on page 4.

New Expenses By ROBERT SHAMIS The heavily added expense that has been created by the C'Onstr-uction of the new dormitories and e:lassrooms makes the new fund drive a most crucial one. The new Offlce of Ex- ternal Affairs will help to more ef- fec-tively eo-ordinate the fund raisirg drive so that it will attain the t!esired ..financial goal.

Response Enthusiastic With the installation of WSPN-AM at , Skidmore College in Saratog-a Sprmg-s, the Union Broadcast:ng ~roup In~. completed the first S'tep m a maJO'r $40,00() expansi·on pro- gram. Formerly WRUC Radi{}, the man- ageme;nt of Union's radio station formed a separate corporation to han- dle the expanddng activities of the oampus station. The Uni<>n Bl\oadoast- ing Group Inc. is owned by the col- lege, managed by students and over- seen ])y a faculty dominated Board cf Dire~tors. The Group owns and <>perates WRUC at Unicm, th·e nation's oldest radio station, and the recently added Skidmore station. In addition to the radio properties, UBG has a small advertising agency and a re- gional representative firm to sell ad- vertising for CoUege radio stati.ons i'll the northeast. ABC Coverage Added \Many of the facets of the Gr()up's expansion progvam are not immedi- ately visible to the Union studenrts,\ according to Group President Riehoard Ferguson. \Two add.itions to <the pro- gramming schedule have received con- siderable comment however,\ Fergu- SJn stated. ABC News and S!}orbs now being caJ:Ti% on both th·e Union and Skidmore stati(:}ns have added to the station's ability to deliver to its audienoe the very best coverege pos- sible of world and national happen- . ing~s. We're IN Now The other addition is the Group's pffiUation with the IVY Radio Net- work, a corpo.ration owned by the ra- radio stations in the IVY League. The Network maintains advertis'ng sales offices in New York, New Haven and Boston and has been extremely suc- cessful in gaining the acce]?'tan~e of national advertise:rn for its stationos.

Tallest in 'Toga Newe&t and most spectacular i·s .tJhe new Performing Arts Center in Sara- tcga. Housed h1 \the tallest building in Saratoga County\ as their p1:1b!icity proudJly, and inexpJ.icaJbly so proclams, SPAC is truly impressive. Boasting the New York City Ballet with George Balanchine for July and the Philadelphia Orchestra with Eugene Orrnandy in Augnst, the cen- ter is assured of excellence in this category. And, if these performing groups were not enough, the Centet· has imported .top outside talent such as Van C!ib1:1rn, Isaac Stern and Leon- tyne Price, who starred in \Anthony and Cleopatra\ at the MetropoUta·n Opera House's offi nial opening in New Yot·k this past fall. Gideon Putnam Hote'l, ek Behind the house itself is a brook and waterfall- which can be shut off during the per- formances by ,tJhe orchestra to prevent the noise from interfering with the music. Well-Designed M echani0ally, too, the Center is an achievement of the first rank. The stage has room to st()re over 104 sets, the proscenium is 100 .feet by 60 feet, the indoor capacity is over 5,000. And another 7,000 can see and hear from the lav.'lls which slope down to fo1·m a semi-natura•l amphitheater. New Deal Bati:Js Most important to any festival of cc>Urse, is the quality of the artists. Beyond the mus·ic itself, the entil'e setting is wch as to make anyone feel WO!Hlerfut Set in the midst <>f the Saratoga Park, i.t is surround'ed by acres of rolling lawns and wo0ds, by .the New Deal bath houses, by the And most important the design al- lows a relatively clear sound w·h'ch is focused by panels on the outside LJf the building whic'h allows the night air to enter at the same time. Probably the biggest problem the Center faces is ·intrinsic to the area it serves. It has· been estimated 75% of the audience came .from within 5fl miles of Saratoga. And this group is not known for its breadth of cultural a tta·inmen ts. Conservative Program Consequently, or so the sbor:y is told, the Center felt forced to schedule a remarkably cons·ervative program. Solid, weB-performed, but not novel in any sense of the word. Even its contemporaries like Hindemith we~e old name.s to concer.t-goers. There Is some talk, as yet unofficial, that the financial success of the fin:·•t season (the $180,000 deficit was $20,000 less than anticipated) may be a m()derat- h1g influence and next year's program may he somewhat more adventunms. One of the nicest features of the session was the Monday chamber mu- sic recitals given during August by .personnel of the Philadelphia Orches- tra. Given in the Casino in Congress Park in Saratoga, it was reminiscent of what chamber music must have been like when there were real cham- bers and private royal audiences. The .casino, with a capacity of around 200, is lavishly furnished from its dayos as one of the richest g>ambling haUs in the country.

Near Lake George is situated Queensbury, the home of the Lake George Opera Fes- tival. This festi:va:l comes nowhere near the standards of SPAC. It gives its performances in a high school au- ditorium, its singers are young and relatively unknown, its repertory is on the conservative side. Huge Cultural Contribution Nevertheless it makes a huge con~ tribution to the cutural offerings uf an area which would Dtherwise be devoid of such without it.

Theaters In Saratoga itself two theaters pre• sented their wares to the pu:blic though with somewhat less happy con- sequences. The Skidmore Comedy Arts Theate1• was designed to give productions of first-rate comedies, showing that their worth is as high as the more talked-of tragedy. Although a paJ:tial success artistically, the pubHc was not suf- ficierutly iruterested and the playhouse closed at an untimely date some wee~s· before scheduled .

4 Thursday, October 13, 1966 Galaxy Players: 'Tartuffe' Dissects Gullibility DAN BUTION Button On Vietnant: The Noble Crusade By DAN BUTTON · Special to Concordiensis ·; Daniel Button is a form!'r executive editor of the Albany Times- lhtion who resigned, to run for Cong·ress in the 29th District on the Libe-ral and Republican lines. He is scheduled to speak on campus at 4 Jl.m. on Tuesday, October 18th in Hale House Student Lounge. I went to Viet Nam for two weeks as a corre-spondent because l ·wanted to see at first-hand the conditions under which Americans ar-e fighting there. I think-as perplexing and confusing as the V~et N am situation is-that there's good reason for every American to try to understand fully what our country ts trying to do there. While there, I saw not only American men in the field but I had ta.lks with high officials of the Ky goYernment, and four lengthy hrterviews with Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge and Deputy Am- h~ssad·or Porter. Just a month ago, millions of Vietnamese voted in what has be£11. .described-somewhat optimistically-as the country's fh·st free elE:!ction. The election was ·successful despite Viet Cong terrorism. .·h'nericans can take some heart in what may turn out to be a pre- cllJ'SOl~ of a democratic government in Viet Nam, a country with aJ>go lutely no traditions of freedom as we know it. Elections Important I !'an't over-emphasizl' the importance of the elections not only tu the Vietnamel;?e but to Americans. If they p1•ove truly .a success, th~t country will be much better able to stand on its own feet and defend it:;:;elf against its enemi!'s. Inci·dentally, the Viet Cong repre- se:Jlt no more than 10 to 15 1 per cent of the South Vietname.:;e. If the elections prove to have 5trengthened democracy's foothold in Viet Nam, the Viet Cong will be increasingly disct·edited, and despite their te~rori':::;m, the military conflict will be much more nearly concluded. Admirable Points _-\H this emphasizes one of the more admirable points of Ameri- <'UJl involvement in Viet Nam. ~ot only are we there with three hundred thousand men in uniform, but we're helping to establish a ]JO]itical system based on democratic institutions instead of auto- crucy. To carry this out in the midst of a war is unp1·ecedented in the world's history. Fu:rthermorc, just as important and just as drama tic, we are spending hundreds upon hundreds of mililons of dollars, sending in thou:;ands of Ameriran specialists, to plan and create a viable eeo- JJomic base for Viet Nam. We are trying to give it a political and :m economic !'<tabilitv !'<o that AmE>riran service men can bE> with- c1I:~m\n as South Viet· :'~:am estahli::;he~ itself as a strong nation. Exception to Johnson I must take exception to the Johnson Administration's lack .:Jf faith in the American people and in our own democratic institutions for what I feel is a consistent lack of candor. There seems to be a ·willingness in Washington to tell the truth only when the truth will s~rve a pm·pose, but not nec~ssarily otherwise. T feel that this con- triibutes to the great confusion, uncertainty, and restriveness that all nur <>ountry seems to feel about the Viet Nam war. niffiC\ult r!ays are still ahead. As a nation, we must be patient, we must try to undel'stand what we are doing and why-and surely this calls for a reaffirmation of a proper relationship between the rleC'ision makers in Washing-ton and the people all over the count1·y. Thi~ is laC\king now, and I fe!'l it is a contributing reason to the belief of many people that the President just shouldn't have any rn~l'E' \Ye:::\ men ln Washington.

Through the Sham The fly in the happy ointment is the fact that Organ's family sees through the sham, includ- ing· his dau:.>;hter whom he wants to marry to Tartuffe, and have a cordial hr:tred for his constant meddling and his undue influ- ence on Orgon. In effect, the play juxtaposes the str:ngth'.s of family against those of gull:- b'lity~wt'h almost disastrous consequences for the former.

ROCKY: A BOON TO EDUCATION I~y GEORGE BIOXDO \This is first in a se1•ies of articles con- cerning- the current political campaigns. :New York State's Governor HockefeUer has recently been accused by various people as having been a do-nothing governor. Com- ments like \Is he still governor?\ \All he's changed in the last eight years is wives.\ and \Rockefeller for ex-governor!\ have been aired from Montauk to B11ffalo. 'J'hEJ voter's dissatisfaction with their gov- ernor is in part understa.nd:able. For al- though Rockefeller has received a good deal of publicity, much of it has dealt not with hir11 38 11:overnor but with him as a million- nil-e and divorce. Wide-spread publicity of hi~ personal life has overshadowed his polit- icaJ ac<!omplishments. Because he doesn't rer.ne.:mber hearing or reading much about Rodefeller's administration, many a John Q, .Public assumes that its accomplishme·nts wea:e insignificant. Not Typical Nelson Rockefeller is no typical politician. Perhaps because he has always been rich and influential, Mr. Rockefeller has neve1· had to make his every success known to as maJ\y- people as possible to find their sup- port. This is not saying that he has simply ste:pped fmm one position to another re- gardless of his merit. He has long been ree<Og\llized among statesmen as a mos·t able leai£1e:r. He is, by nature, however a little quieter about his accomplishments. As a re- sult the voting public is larg-ely unaware of his vast success as the Governor of the Em- pire State. Nelson Rockefeller spearheaded the most dramatic and dynamic aid to higher educa- tion .program ever attempted in Ame1ica. SUN\'{ (The State Unversity of New York) has, in the last eight years, emerged from its former teacher's college status to a fh·st- rate university. Today SUNY has an en- rollment triple that -of 1958-59! There are now 108,000 students enjoying vastly im- proved facilities, faculties and courses. And the teacher-student ratio has actually im- proved! The quality of teachers is on the upswing too. Attracted by better ·sala1•ies, new equipment and an opportunity to mold courses f1•om their birth, highly qualified scholars have come to SUNY at a fantastic rate. Students in New York State for whom less than a decade ago a college education was out of reach, now have more financial aid available to them than all the other students in the entire U. S. have! The num- ber of Regents State Scho.Jat'ships has mol'e than tripled. Over 72,000 new guaranteed' and largely interest-free loans were made last year-compared to about 5,000 ih 1958. Albany State One look at the Albany State Campus will testify to the intensity, and beauty of the new university construction :vrogram.

OP t Y. • Thursday, October ·1 3, 1966 The Future: Studyi11g in the halls, a result of the Sexual Devolution. Movie Review: Hemingway ~Bogey And HonkyaTonk 5 A Plea For Sexual .Devolution By BARRY NEWMAN In the aU night study room, the cold floures- cent light co.Jors the pages of your philosophy text a pale obtruse. It's 2 ·a.m. on a silent Sunday morning., and no one else is there. In the bath- >l'oom the pretty blue disinfectant is ·still and calm. All night drunken boys stormed into the gentle- men's room, profaned it with the .fruits of ex- c2ss, and stormed out again, Beh!nd the distant carrel, you labored on. At 2 a.m. your eyes are heavy, so you .pile your hooks and l'Ustle your coat and bump a desk w:t'1 a great grinding noise, and walk out into the darknes:1. The parties are over. The campus is asleep. Your footsteps echo. The dorm is a tomb, and you quietly shuffle down the dim hall. From the door knob of your mom hangs a cardboard tag-it. says \Go Away.\ You groan a tired, hopeless .groan, and drag yourself back down the haH to the lounge, curl into a .corner, tuck your philosophy book unde1· your head, and drift off to a happier world. It ha~ been this way ever since they changed the soc1~l rules in January 1967 and permitted women m the dorms at all ho-ms. It was bad enough when the college tried to cut down on big weekends in September and created ·six orgies instead of three, But with the new rules, your roommate commandeers the cubicle at least three times a week, and .the lounge is heginning to oe as familiar as your bed. You have complained vainly to the dorm coun· sellar, begging him to stal't a systEm like the one in West College where the la'st three rooms on each hall are reserved permanently for kept women. But he has refused, insisting that such segregation of sexuality gives the college the bad name ·of an inhibitor of student freedom. After all, he argues, the college has given the student the peatest responsi•bility by permitting women· guests, The college does not want to mind the student's busi·ness, but ins.ists the student keep his business in hand and out .of tro-l!lble. Under the old rute, students were trusted only a few hours en isolated evenings, n(}W every Union man is trusted aU the way, :so to speak. But you have always disagreed with this con- tention. Your roommate is a ma,;;terful lover, and though you aspire to his heights, you fall miser- ably short. He gets the room, and you g-et the lounge. On weel,days at the beginning of the year you and he were a winning team, studying together in warm, friendly silence. Now he stud~ ies w.ith hts girl, and you meekly retire to an icy corner of the library. Sure ther~ are rules. Noise is kept at a mim- mqm; everyone must wear some clothes in the lounge; married students are not requit\ed .to have a third roommate; women may not .use shower facilities without asking pennis'sion ().f the stu- dent a•lready in the shower; students may not use '\\'Omen company without asking permission of the student .already in his company. Rules, though, never work. Noise is unbearable at night, and it seems that everyone in the dorm is disturbed-tossing and turning C()onstantly, gasping and moaning. Girls dominate all the sinks and mirrors. They hang stockings on the shower rods. They insist it's not ,P()']i te to curse and have water fights and howl in 'the halls. Your room- mate's gil'l has hung rafe curtains, put a lace doily on your dresser and has this big pink ·stuffed poodle which makes you sn~eze. She filled your closet with her dresses and· your desk drawers with curious small bott]e·s, 'The whole place wreaks from perfume. You dream of the old days when the dorm re- sounded with feul w0rds, ·\l\hen the walls were plastered with air-brushed 'beauties from \Play- boy,\ and the faint aroma of sweat per-meated the building. Sexual Freedon1, you cry, is bunk, You long for demonstrations ai'H]: protests to demand more restrictive administra-ti~n control. Yeu would begi·n by keeping women ·O n'l:y at the end of each hall, and urging a system of ·\rotating cohabita- tion.\ You envision a return to two concert weekends, so women may be e~pectecl to go horne from time to time, with hopes of conserving their en- ergies. Jumbled images of :an all male dorm dance through you slumbering psyche, whi.Je elysian tableaus of a time when d:ates lasted less than a week soothe your troubled .Jnin<l. But it is only a dream ¥\ ou al'e awakened by the bustle of a young lady in the lounge, straight- ening cushions and dusting t!lbles. You grumble to your feet, stuff your shbrt into erumpled cordu- roys, J>ick up your hook a:nd stumble toward the de3erted library. Behind tlle carrel you slump over the inscrutable words, and won'der where you will sleep tonight. Duo's Poetic Call/or Communicati.on By CARL ROSENS'TOCK Simon And Garfunkel-\Wednesday Morning, 3 'A.M.\; \Sounds Of Silence\; \'Parsley Sage, R()semary and 'Thyme.\ It is a difficult task to plea·se two widely dif- fering tastes in music. Rock and RoH is an anat- thema to the f()]k musician, and any foil{ musician who turned to the Hit Parade charts was, until recently, nothing short of traitor. To Have And Have Not gets along with a mere excu·se for a story, takes its time without trying to brag- about its budget or to reel up footage- ~· ' for-footage's sake, and is an unusually happy exhibition of teamwork by talented, highly paid professional hacks. The best of the picture has no connection with the plot at all, but is a lesiurely series of mating duels between Boga1·t at hi's most proficient and the very entertaining, nervy, adolescent, the:t-new blonde, Lauren Bacall. As Bogart plays him, The first person to successfully tran3cend both fields was Bob Dylan. What followed Dylan W8S a series of patent imitators. Sonny and Cher carne out, with. th.eir deeply symbolic plea to Amerira, which smd m effect that \my hair's long, nobody loves me 'cept you, Parents don't understand us but. I got you, Ba_by.\ Occasion.ally this scene, christened the nbvwus-folk-rock, produced sorn~ ~ruly good sounds, by some really talented music- Ians. Probably the best groups and singer-song- writers to appear in this movern~nt were Tbe Birds, The Lovin' Spoonful,. Tl1e Paul Butter- field Blues Band, The Blues Project, .and Tim Hardin. Most of these gmups are not really folk- ro~k. in the sense Sonny and Cher are; they are ongmal performers, who, in reality esca.pe cla:ssi- fi:?ation. Prob:tbly one of the most talented songwriters to appear on this scene is Paul Simon of Simon and Garfunkel. His songs are not imita: tions in the Dylan vein. They are highly personal song'3 which deal with themes not usually covered. at ' • Oo . ~· ., Harry is a kind of Nietzsche in dungarees. Miss · Bacall has a jm·elin-Ike \·itnlity, a born dancer's eloquence in movement, a fierce female shrev:d- ness and special sweet-sourness. Whatever the film has to offer is contained in the sheer dynamic appeal of these two Hollywood idols. Highly Developed This crome-melodrama-ror;nance-comedy is, aft- er all, perhaps the most highly developed type of , American film, and is the chief vehicle for polW- cal thought in ou1· films. Melodrama, like the mor- ality play, is a popular form; ·structuarlly, melo- drama is the morality play with the sermons ~· omitted and the pattern of oppositions issuing in sensational action. Its intention is primarily to entertain (by execution) rather than to instruct (enter~ainingly). Labels ·stand for the sermons that are dispensed with and action is central. \'l Something about this film has a little of the nostalgia of highballs that taste like rotten ma- hogany, defective mechanical pianos at implac- able fortissimo, or gents-roo-ms strange! with the fragr-ance of mentholated raspbe1•ries. For its '' general romantic, kidding appreciation of hanky- tonk, To Have And Have ~ot is unmatched. Promoter from Miami A smart promoter, in Miami, Florida, turned them into the hits that they are now. The last cut on the first side of their first Album, \Wed- nesd·ay Morning . . .\ was a fait'ly g-ood song called'--\Sounds of Silence\ but it was straight folk, with no electricity. So over the original cut~ he taped over an electric back-ground. The re- sult wa:s a national best seller, which quickly es- tablished the names of Simon and Garfunkel. Their first album, Wednesday Morning 9 A.M., is straight folk. On the alburn is the folk ver- sion of \sounds of Silence.\ The best songs .rtf the album are ''Bleeker Street,\ \Sparrow Song\ and \Benedictus.\ The first three songs all deal with a theme that Simon is constantly touching- the idea of lack of communication between in- dividuals. \Benedictus 11 is a beautiful rendition of the prayer used in the maew;;. Introspective Composer On their second album, Sounds Of Silence, one can see Paul Simon at hi:s introspective best Simon and G<1rfunkel sing a personal brand of folk-rock. There are no topical ·songs on this album. 'There is one on their first album- ·a song entitled \He Was My Brother-\-which is not so rnuch a new type song, like \Eve of Destruction,\ but a subtler protest along the lines of \The L()nesome Death Of Hattie Carroll.\ The bulk of tbe songs oll thrs album deal with lack of commUllication, espe- cially between lovers. The most m()ving of these songs is one entitled \Kathy's Song'', \l ~ a Rock\ is also included in this album, Most of the songs don't have the loud electric background, typical of most folk-rock. The result of a.ll this is that the soft songs are done sof.t.ly with a simple background, and they are d()one beautifully, A word here abo-ut \Parsley Sag-e R.osem.ary and Thyme '' Not much can be S2id al>out this album, as it was just rele:a·sed. Most of the songs, including \Homeward Bo~And\ and \Dangling Con- versati()on\ which are als.o on t:he album, follow along the same lines as the ·second album. They are soft songs, ha untillg- il.lld t:hey linger on in your mind. There are two s.ongs of a topical vein -\A Simple, Desultory P\hillipic\ and \7:00 News Silent Night,\ the lattEr of which. is frightening in a way that can't be dEscribed.

Convocations The Delphics recently decided that any student caught creating a disturbance at convocation may be forced to attend an extra one. This seems typical of the attitude that the present system both fosters and is, itself, the result of. \You can lead a horse to water,\ goes the old saying, and you can force a student to attend convocation. But in neither case can any worthwhile gain be forced upon the unwilling in- dividual-of the four or two-legged variety. The basic question is whether the present system accomplishes anything at all. The rationale behind it is that this is the only way we can assure the audienc-e necessary for obtaining top speakers. But we wonder whether it is beneficial to expose the college at its most in courteous. And beyond that, it raises some questions about what the people in the Admissions Department are doing. Per- haps it is not too much to ask that they start taking some people who have enough interest in the intellect so as to want to hear the speakers who are brought to campus. And Sometimes Communists President Johnson showed an admirable willingness last week to disregard the pressures of the war in Vietnam and to try to achieve closer relations with Eastern Europe. For too long, this country has let matters of ideology enter into its pursual of foreign policy. While not bad in itself, this has too often been a rigid matter of blacks and whites bearing little relationship to the realities of the situaion. And the unfortunate consequence of this has been an inability to take advantage of opportunities as they presented themselves. It is, indeed, unfortunate that this same enlightened attitude cannot be applied to South East Asia. In Vietnarr we are committing our forces, now well over the quarter- million mark, in support of a government led by a mar described in a recent New York Times Magazine article as an \Asian Captain Marvel.\ This same article points out that the government we support is composed of the old ruling classes who will tell Americans anything that will keep us on their side while cheerfully sabotaging all programs to end some of the misery and poverty that have made the country such fer- tile ground for Communist propaganda. It is furthermore, unfortunate that this country, based historically on freedom and self-determination, is giving up those ideals at just the time that they are so much more in alignment with the ideals of the rest of the world than they have been in the past. In the name of duty, to whom is never defined, we have undertaken to destroy a country. Even the pretense of benevolence and disinterest is falling by the wayside, destroyed by chemical warfare and napalm and military ruler. In short, we find ourselves taking a path with only the justification that we started the journey and that \we can't get out now,\ usually shrilly proclaimed with the attitude that only a fool or a traitor could disagree. But the fact of the matter is that we, ourselves, have never really understood what we are trying to do in Viet- nam. Our goals are at best negative. Our support is go- ing to reactionaries. And our prestige is going downhill. It. is not too late to try to reverse this situation. But this will require the ability to recognize the fact that in some instances the Communists are the only groups with the interest and energy to form a viable government. If this is the case in Vietnam, and ev-erything seems to point to this conclusion, then it is in the long-range interests of the United States to end its opposition to the Viet Cong and to help them restore the nation to prosperity. Thursday, October 13, 1966 Letters ·To The Editor Public Matter? To the Editor: My colleag-ue's almost Swift- ian Credo may have left an er1·oneous impression o.f the o.Jl- erational meaning of moral tar- pitude. I was once told, in an- othel' time and place, what woul'd constitute moral tm·pi- tude-an example, happily, only a bit hyperbolic-\committing adultery with the Dean's wife in the front window of Macy's.\ Indeed a faculty membe1· is mo1:e like.Jy to be censured for Pl!blic advoca('y than fur private cOlYlmitment. In a mixed and incons'stent world,· gentlemen may hold a \·arietv of beJ:efs. \It's Ul> to the g'entlemen,\ as one adv·er- tisement puts it. One thin,g seems to me certain. A gentle- man does not make f,ornication a public matter-neithet• his own nor anyone's \else's Sincerely yours, Martin C. GideonsP Aloof Council To the Editor: Several interested students recently appeared at a student council meeting with some criti- cism of the membership. The students were nonmembers with some co-ncern over the appa1·ent aloof position of council mem- bers after elections. The stu- dellcts complained that the rep- resentatives actively campaigned during the elections, but then the student body never saw the:m again. Of course it is true that can- didates actively seek support during elections. However after the election I feel that these men are even more con~er·ned o~bout th,e ideas of their support- ers. No candidate has the time to f\01low up every voter, though. I know of no council member that heb himself in his room after elections. They want to represent those that elected them I bel!eve the problem lies more with the student body. They elected these people and I feel it is their duty to follo\v, .:dds_·, or en~:1 criticize their representatives. This may sound untrue, but how many council _nembers have time to see every- one on campus or even in t!-leir class to see if they h.rwe any ne\v ideas for t~1e coun. il ? That is qu!te a lQt of time. Even wt:h these rrob!ems mQst council 11embers make an Effort to 1cknow!edge student opinion. What I propose is a challeng2 to the student body. There are 'nOre electio,ns coming up, par- t:cularly for the freshmen. It is up to the dudent to exam!r.e the candidao:es and assure him- S2lf that the man he elects w:Il represent him a:1d listen to h's views. But it is the individu:::l who must carry hi's proposal to h!s representatives. The chr l- 'enge is for the s:udents t.o f()l- low up their representativ~s; ·rou should even pester tl.em if necessary. I myself would J;;;e ·ery much to hear any ir!~,:-- s :hat stur'ento;; have for the All '.::olleg-e Council. Sincerely, Frank McKlm 'GI Re~~rting Critic~zed To the Editor: I object to yom· news;;aper's current coverage of ~bde:·t Body Presidency successicn in the September twent~·-secJIHl and twenty-ninth editions of Co11.cordienseis. The absence of tact in repOJt- :ngo (i.n particular, Balagur's ar- ticle of September twenty- ninth.) demands extra personal poise from those mentioned. in !Jrint. This seeming indifTeren ·e of editorship demonstrates tJ the readeT little co-operat'on or understanding- between student government anrl publica 'ion. Concordiensis has failed to consult with me since last Spring. If your reporters had troubled ;o interview me, a g-reat deal of misunders,tanding and embarrassment could have been avoided. I do suppose that it is . the Union student's right •to b2 notified of forthcoming criticism in print. He should be given an immediate and equal opportunity to reply on his own behalf. Damage.s have been done. I hesitate to surmise what ethics and precedents your newspaper is leading to. Sincerely, Morgan F.

The Governor's accompl.ishments are cer- tainly not limited to even this vast pl'Oject ,in sta.te supported higher education.

Millions of families now live in clean renewal neighborhoods, enjoy cleaner water anod more be.&utifu} parks, and wiU 'soon qualify for free medi- ra>J care, all because of ,programs accom- plished under their present Governor. But clearly the most significant fact about om not-too-publicized Governor Rockefeller is the tremendous concern he has shown for us, the students of New York State. We're Winners! We have been the reaper's of the richest .::nd most generous opportunities in the his- lory of The Empire State.

It is easler to get to see the' pl·ayers and C()aches in a small college, but it is also harder to get the people to write about them. A few people have suggested t:o me that the Sports Staff pre- view upcoming g-ames, w·ith ex- poses of 'the opponents' sf:,ar players, type of offen·se, weak- nesses, etc. This is a possibility.

By G\AHY PREVOST Jack :--J\icklaus is the best profesional golfer in the world today as eddenced by his Masters and British Open victories of 1966; however, in two other 1966 events, the United States Open and the World Match Play Tournament, one could see a possible obstacle in big Jack's d1·ive to be- come the greatest golfer of all time. During the second round of the U. S. open at San Francisco, he was \Vat\TIE'd by official~ th:1t his slow play could cost him a penalty. Jack pro- test!:'d, saying that golf should not be measureu by a stop watch. LaRt week in the World Match !'lay Toumament in England, Nicklaus asked for a free lift due to an obstruction, but he was de- nied the request. Jack's ensuing protest resulteJ iu the fh·st resignation in the history of British p;olf by an official during an important match. GolfPrs have beE'n penalized before; in fact, 19fi6 U. S. Open Champ Bill Casuer suffered a two-stroke penalty during the final round of the Sahara Invitational last year for slow play, but \Buffalo Bill\ went on to win the tournament by two strokes. In the 1966 U. S. Open, Nicklaus \\\as not penalized but after his argument with officials, he made four consecutive bogies, his tempo obviously affected. The four strokes were the margin which placed him in third place at the end of the tournament. Golfers have questioned official decisions be- fore, but in England la:st week whert the big Ohioan was facing Gat·y Player of South Africa in the 36 hole finals of the World Match Play Tournament, Jack's play was affected by his argument with an official. Jack was one down when he asked for the ruling on the ninth hole and after a long los- ing argument, Jack played bad golf on the back nine and went four down, a deficit that he never made up. Jack Nicklaus has reached the pinnacle of the golf world with a combination .of finely tuned golf and tremendous comnosm·e. 'Ilhe two recent out- bursts may only have been inridental, but J.ack must realize that all golfers, whatever their sta- ture, should accept the on-the-spot decisions of the officials and concentrate on golf. Nicklaus has every right to question the official but not on the golf course during the round being played. I protest Jack's action not just because he questioned the judgment of golf officials, but I would hate to see Nicklaus fall from his pinnacle over something not directly connected to his golf- ing ability. Ketzmen Make Progress; .Face Vermont Tuesday By BILL CROWLEY The varsity cross country team of Union College opened its 1966 season in cdhlpe- tition with Oneonta State on Octob~r 12 at Oneonta. In viewing the squad's chances for success in their first meet this year, Coach Ketz said that his team will. be handicapped in several asiQects. He felt that the xunners were not in top condition yet for faring a strong Oneonta team which had four meets already this season and has a fine ::l-0 record thus far, They have defeated Platts- burg (19-45), Oswego (19-36), and Potsdall'l (20- 35). Last yea,r the Dutchmen were beaten by Oneonta by the score of 27-28. The Hills Additional difficulty arises due to the faet that the On 'onta com':Se was much more hill:Y' than tne cross country tract at Union. Ketz a]so re~ marked that the team is a little slower this year :han last becau'Se of the loss .of his two top men Bill Beevers and David Ring. · ' Myron Fribush, C1 top Garnet harrier, warms up with fresh Larry Stevens. Previous to the initial competition, Coaeli Ketz listed the probable starting runners for this sea- son. He figured his top man to be Myron Fl'ibush, a sophomore. Also picked to head the field is Coaeh Ketz's second man, Neil Campman. Num- ber three runner on thes quad is Spencet Hunt who is a junior this year. Adding suppmt to the Ketzmen campaign are: Ed Manfred, fourth man; Allan Sessoms, fifth man; Richard Marshall, sixth man; and Bruce N oe, seventh man. Booters Win, 5 Record Is 1-1-J The soccer team defeated Alfred 5-2 Friday to even record at 1-1-1 after drop- ping a hard-fought 2-0 de- cision to Oneonta Wednes- day. This week the boaters face Middlebury and R.P.I. The Engineers invading Daley Field Saturday at 12:30. The Garnet scored early agai!nst Alfred and were never headed. Down 4-0 in the fourth period of play, the visitors tinally broke through for a score against the second team.

He spoke at t~e fourth annual Union College Civil Rights rally las,t Sunday night. The Institute for Services to Educa- tion is an org'anization partially spon- sored by the feder,al government. The ISE aids Southern colleges whose enrollment is primarily Negro. Program Proctor outlined a three-point pro- gram for the civil rights movement in a talk entitled \Where Do We Go From Here in Human Rights?\ The meeting was co-sponsored by Union College and the Schenectady chapter of the NAACP. His first point was that if Negroes all over the country wcmld register and vO<te, they could accompUsh their objectives much more easily. He cited as an example the situation in Atl!anta where three NegJ:oes sit in the Geor- gia State Senate. Stereotype His second point was that civil rights organizations should work toward the elimination of the Negro stereotype. He urged Negroes to work for \inclusion at every level.\ He continued, \I've never seen a Negro state trooper or a Negro Greyhound bus driver.\ Finally, Proctor pleaded for the en~ forcement of existing laws.

Rather than have the A.C.C lay down specific rules, it will recommend that '1lhe various student organizatiot11s, such as the I.F.C., I.R.G., and the Student Council, e,sta:blish their own guidelines and policies toward stu- dent activities. The A.C.C. wHl not concern itself with the type of entertainment ap- pearing ·on campllls so much as with the manner in which it is condue>ted. Volinski stressed that throughout this year the emphasis will be on student establishment of their own guideli.nes and policies. He said that if the first few attempts fail, the ad- ministration will not immediately step in. \The students shl'>'uld try, however, to make them successful,\ Volinski said. While the Student Council is as yet unsure of its .position, the Tax Com- mittee will is:sue a .policy statement soon C()ncerning campus entertain- ment. Meanwhile, the I.F.C., I.R.C., and the Student Council are sponsor- ing entertainment for Nov. 19. SttJdent Responsibility \It is not the frequency of parties and entertainment ,alone, but the stu- dent conduct will spell the success or failure of this ven·ture,\ said Dean Lockwood in an interview Monday. He, too, stressed that the responsibil- ity in the weeks ahead will lie with the student, bo.th to establish policy and to carry H out. The Dean said that a major prob- lem has been excessive drinking. He suggested that it is a matter of taste and maturity. \The students should try to see that drinking remains within reasonable bounds.

The present best-seller of the Four Tops is \Reach Out,\ which has topped the charts across the nation for many weeks. They also have tow smash albums featuring their own brand of \Motown Sound.\ majority of the faculty support the new policy, and that if student social life is carried out in a mature and pleasant way, the faculty will be pleased. \It is only a small group of students who are objectionable to the faculty and to their fellow students. We must carve out a pattern of social activi,ty within which we can enjoy ourseJves without offending others. The success of the whole venture reSJbs with the students,\ said the Dean, . \and a majority obviously wants 1t to work.\ The All College Council meeting was held Monday night at Dean Loc)r- wo,od's house. In attendance were Edwin Kirkman Tolan, Librarian and Profeg,sor of Philosophy, Walter Lowen, Professor of Mechanir-al En- gineering, and Alfred Theodore .Goble, Chairman and Professor of the Dept. of Physics. Also attending were Deans Lock- wood and Pollock. Students in attend- ance were Frank McKim, Paul Co~­ tello, \Doc\ Benjamin, and Hunter Louis, President of the Inter-Fratern- ity Council. ) Button Blasts -Calls Hint A Conners; Yes-Man/ Nick Matt, President of Kappa Alpha, contended .that a group of local people were causing trouble at KA ,over the weekend and that several at- tempted to steal po.cketbookJS. Upon being forced to leave KA, these al- leged intruders moved to a fire alarm box near Andrew Carnegie Hall. They then allegedly began taunting a nearby KA who went back to his fraternity to get help. Only miil'utes later, the fire alarm was pulled and the ScheneDtady Fire Department rushed to the campus. No monetary penalties are levied against Unio.n for false alarms. As a result of last weekend's difficulties, guards will be posted a.t all gates over home f(}otball weekends and, if neces- sary, over all party weekends. Cotnntittee Proposed on Editorials Jl 1 \I am against increasing Am~riean forces in Viet Nam. The United S,taJtes should take moves both economically and politically that will help Viet Nan> achieve an identHy and a central gov- ernment of its own.\ Daniel Button, Li):Jeral and Republi- can candidate for Congress from the Albany-Schenectady district, was speaking at a meeting of the Uni<m College Young Re,public~s and the Port!cal Forum. He said thart; he thinks that the nation must aim i1ls policies in t!te drrec~ion which wi~l relieve it of the ultrmate responsi- bility for Viet Nam. Vietnamese Experiences The U.S. should tend toward a r~­ duction of its military forces, both in number of troops. and firepower. In part, he said, he based hls opini~ns on his impressio,ns of Viet Nam which he gained there late last summer. The present policies are attemJ?~S to solve polit:cal prob'ems with mili- tary means. Button says that he. ~x­ pects some, although_ probably s~1~ht, modification of the V1et Cong position, and would eventually effect a reduc- tion of the Nort!1 Vietnamese infiltra- tion. Button also dealt with the philoso- J>hY of the role of the modern con- gressman. He finds the present body tends to be an echo of the voice of the White House,rather than a source of leadership and al•ternatives to the President. \The President wants the Congress to be a mirror of his own image. He } ,i does not believe in the two-.party s~ s- tem: he derides the opposition or hugs them to death.\ At one point, Button characterized Jr>hnson as an autocrat. ) J Faults Own Party Noting that the image of th~ Re- ' publican party is currently spirt be- tween 1964 Goldwwterites, Southern racists, Nixon -conservatives, he said the New York :party was one that !)resented the responsible image. This party can present the respon- sible and credible program, an altern- ative to the President's, whic-h is , demanded by the gravity of current ' questions facing Congress. He found his Democratic opponent, Richard Conners, lacking in the qualities of '. independence and individual initiative, noting Conners' record of never dis- senting from the party po,sition during his 25 years in office in Albany. Sees Hope Conners, the president of the Al- bany Common Council, has been fre- quently accused by Button of being nothing more than a yes-man to Daniel O'Connell, the head of the Democratic Party organization in A,l- bany. The Common Council is totally Democmtic and has not had a dissent- ing vote on any recent tallies. Continued on Page 2 Trouble for A// Houses No evidence exists concerning who actually turned in the alarm; ''To dispel rumors,\ Nick Matt commented, \I don't l>elieve that anyone in this house pulled the !llarm.\ He added that \turning in such a false al.arm is not an educated thing to do. If any fraternity man did do this, it would only cause trouble for all houses.\ Dean Pollock firmly s-tated that borth fire alarms were tumed in by persons not as,sociated with Uni{)n College.

The Garnet now 'Stand 1-2-1 for the season, and will attempt to even theil· record Saturday when they fa.ce Hobart in Geneva. James Gains On offense James was the whole story. Time and a,i'ain he ripped through the Engineer line for big gains, totalling 111 yards. The big sophomore scored 2 touchdowns and a conversion ~s the Garnet offense rolled to a score each period. The first score came on a 46-yard Union drive, the key play being a 23- yard pass from Bob Utecht to Dill. With ,the ball on the 6, Halfback Steve Roehm, replacing the injured Jim Ramich, slashed to the goal line where he fumbled. However the alert James recovered for the score. James slanted· into pay dirt for the conver- sion. The Garnet defense seemingly had stopped RPI, however a roughing th,e kicker penalty gave them a new life on the Union 32. Here Ni.cotera got the time he needed and hit on 3 pass- es, the last being to Stan Sweetser for the touchd{)wn. The conversion a.ttempt failed and Uni.on led 8-6.

Untort took over on the 8 and quickly scored, James going the last yard. Ramich, who saw limited action, swept right end untouched for the conversion to make the half- time score 16-6.

Midway throug,h the fourth quarter Continued on Page 6 By BRIAN HOLLEY At a Student Council meeting last Thursday, Mike BerlowHz moved for the establishment of a four man com- mittee to consult with the editor-in- chief of Concordiensis. The proposed committee consisting of two Student Council members and two non-memhers would have the au- thority to consult with the Concordy editor to discuss the subject and con- tent of editorials. Berlowitz stated that the· committee would not be obli- gated to consult with the editor-in- chief but would do so only when the committee members decided it wa.g necessary. Berl()Witz argued that the standard of recent edi:torials clearly illustrates the need for such a com- mittee. Review Board Be'ieving that he was misunder- stood, Eerlowitz later state.d that he was intereSJted \in an editorial rev:ew board more than anything else,\ and open to any changes or amendments to his motion. His intent was not to establish a form of governmental con- trol ·Of the p:·ess. Berlowitz further sta!ed that his objections were not re- lated to the person \but to the posi- t'on.\ He termed present editorial con- duct as \poor journalism\ and de- nounced the editor's use of the word \we\ w:thout consulting the Senior or Junior Boards or c-onsidering the opinions of staff members and other students. The Berlowitz motion was tabled pending further action at the next Council meeting on November lst. In other action, Robert Benjamin called for in altera,tion of the Coun- cil by-laws' regarding pal'tv weekends. The propo~ed changes would eliminate the methdd of conducting three major weekends and establish in i:ts place procedure regarding small weekends. Following the motion, there was much discussi·oti regarding the size and na- ture of the proposed smaller week- ends. No specific definition of a small weekend '\vas established. This moti(}n was also tabled unrt;il the next Stu- dent Council ltleet'ing. An emergency motion was enter- Continued on Page 2 '.

2 West Gern2an Diplontat Address Full House Dr. Neils Hansen, Deputy Consul General of the German 'CQnsulate in New York, s:pea:king before a standing-room only audience of IRC members, faculty !J.nd re·s1dents descl'ibed \German Political Parties Today,\ this past Thursday m Hale House. .Ill: the Federal Republic o.f Germany there are 3 ma:in parties; the ruling Chnst1an Democrats, the Social Democrats and the Liberals. 'The Christian Dem{)t:rats have been in power since the formation of the •R.eptll)lic in J.949. According to Hansen, the Social Democrats have a go()d chance to gain control in the.1969, election. Fee}mgs that it is \time for a c-hange,\ and the lower po:pulanty of Chancellor b·hard compared to that of Adenhauer make this po·ssible. In addition, two thi·rds of the C.D. party is Gatholit: while Erhard is a Protestant. Two Votes Under Germa:ny's ut1ique electoral systen1, as desc:dbed by Hansen a party is xepresented in the Bunderstag (the lower house) by the percentag; of the total vote it receiYes. Each person gets two votes: one .for the canaidate and .o\f}e for the party. Vote splitting is comm~n, Hansen not<Ed. Any party not receiVIng moxe than 5'!\ of the vote m· e'lectmg at least 3 candidates is not represented. The 5% rule was designed to prevent a large 11umber of splinter parties as hurt the Weimar Republic. West Germany has a Basic Law rather than a consitution in .the hope that a united Germany can be achieved some day, said Hansen. Ullder one provision of this law, a party may be declared suoversive by the i:iupxeme Court and declared to have no legal right to exist. While this law was supposedly made to prevent the reappearance of the Nazi :party, the communist party has been outlawed by a case m 1954. Hansen feels this was a mistake and that it would be better to aUow it to exist in the open. He eited the decline oJ party strength from 300,000 in 1946 to only 80,000 m 1954 as proof of its weakness. Differences between the two main parties were discussed briefly. Both parties are very similar in their policies but dl'aw their support from different parts· of the country. The failure to reunite Germany, a go<~l of both parties, has not been their fault hut \the fault of the international situation.\ The Lib- erols, the third party, stress the rights of the individual more than the other parties do. Studied in Geneva Hansen received his doctorate in laws in Geneva in 1952 and' has studied in the Univet·sities of Gottingham, Hamburg, Heidelburg and Zm'ich in addition to Geneva. P1·evious to coming to New York, he served in Viena, Libson and Bon.tl. After the speech, International Relations ·Club PresidentMa~·k Zauderer, said, \Dr. Hansen is one of a number of important speakers the IRC will present to 'students and the faculty.

The staff is also working on a plan by which ahout 90% of rthe ·student body will have their pieture in 1ihe yearbook at least once, giving everybody at least one reason to buy the yearbook. An expansion of the Garnet to ap- proximately 250 pages is planned. In- creased advertising and an increased freshmen circulation are the means by which this is to be accomplished. Ne.IV Features Some of tll.e new features planned for the 1967 edition are: a freshmen section; coverage of all intercollegiate sports and intramural competition; a section on stud'ent activities; and the addition of the scores of the past sea- son .of each a.thletic team. Another innovation will be the inclusion of a theme throughout the yearbook with about 10 pages of natural color. • Pres. Martin Seeks Chan~e In Attitude.

Increased Homework 3 O'Conner To Get ·N.Y. Going? By ROBERT STEINGUT This i's a signicant election year. New York State voters have the oppmtun:ity t;o get their State g-overmnent back on a eourse of responsible 'leadership and positive action, a course where It hasn't been the past eight yea1:s. It is a salient point to note that (}ne of the real sy.mptom·s t>f New York State political prob- :lems is personal ambition. Being the great State that it is, New Yor-k has always been the breeding ground for potential Presi~ents of the United s.tates. This ambition certainly has had no claim to e.ither party .. Wh1le Democrats have produced the hkes of President Ro0sevelt, candidate Al Smith andi pt•esidenti:al hopeful W. Averell Harriman' Republicans have provided us with candidat~ Dewey and hopeful Rockefeller. Ambitious Executive tant campaign spending. We need not dwell too long on this matter; suffice it to .say that whetl!er the Democratic claims that he will spend ·some $20 mHlion seeking re-election are entirely- true otr not (the fact is that he will break all records, exceeding by conservative estimates a campajgn budget of some twelve million dollars), he is spending at least five times as much as anyone else ever has in a Statewide campaign. Hol:Htrt :Kennedy's campaign of 1964 cost $1.3 million. Eis opponent Kenneth Keating filed expenditures of $750,000. These were \.shocking\ expenditures just two years ago. In 1966, the O'Connor campaign may or may not reach the $1 million mark. Thi·s all begs the question: Can a supedo1• ,can- didate, superior in every respect .except the ability t0 spend on his campaign, ovet·come the brain- washing efforts of his wealthy opponent and v.rin a modern election ? Or, more succinctly, could an Abraham Lfncoln, or an AI Smith, or a Raxry T1•uman win a contempora.ry contest, or ;even be considered :;~s a potential candidate? In this election Frank O'Connor and everyone who casts his ballot for him, can ha.ve the chance to show that quality can triumph over nor>pla, even in the center stage of 1966 elections. leadership and Courage Another comment frequently made was that the total amou~t of homew:61'k had increased, despite the reductiOn from five to three course·s.

When a neophyte to the JlOlitical scene in 1958, he told us that he had no .p·olitical ambitions other than to serve as the State's chief executive· .then, upon election to office, :he made sortie~ at a nomination eventually won by Richard Nixon. Four years later, after solemnly pledging that he was in·terested only in the Albany State House, he was re-eleded; hyo years aftEr that, he spent a small fortune trymg to steal .the nomination frolll Barry Goldwater. T-oday, in an election yea-1', he once again promtses tMit he has no na- tional.ambitions. What does it ali mean? ln the eras of the Smiths, R~osevelts, Deweys and Harrimans, state government was a far less eomple:x operation than it is today. State legis- :latures '&huflled in and out of Albany with reg.u- laTity, with sessions running ninety days to the day. Governors had a thirty day bill-signing period, and the business of .Albany ran like a pre- cision Swiss watch. The story of Frank O'Connor 'is one of leader- ship and courage. As the District Attomey in his native Queens County over a twelve year per- iod, he showed exceptional qualitie'S in being the DA in the State to support the abolition of ;capital punishment; he was the only DA out of 62 to sup- port the Metca:lf-Volker approach to .the treat- ment of nru-cotics addicts (a medical-not criminal -approach, such as arlvocated by Governor Rocke- feller).

The three-part y~ar allows each person to further experiment with his interests or explore a field not directly 1•elated to his major. Re-evaluation of Courses The switch to the new system allowed profes- sors to re-evaluate their courses, and, because of the time change, design new ones. Dr. William Bennett, Assistant Professor of Economics, says that the opportunity to teach new courses is very exciting. \I've made up a new course without a textbook, only outside reading, which can be flex:- ible in contrast to the old system which had a long-established set of courses.\ In return for the freedom of students to choose their classes and the professors' to, design them, the trimester system forces both sides to avoid \> falling behind. With the pl'es'sure of a ten rather than fifteen week course, each student and pro- fessor must make more preparation for every class hour. According to Professor Henry Har- low, Chairman of the Department of Civil Engi- neering, \the students have to take their work more seriously. They can't ·save work for vaca- tion ..• \ Ending the courses at Christmas vaca- tion will eliminate what Assistant Math Professor ·Henry K. Holt ~alls the \lame duck\ ses'sion, the post-vacation period which everyone spent .trying to remember what they had studied almost a month before. , The change, accomplished with relatively little 'difficulty in view of its novelty and the installa- tion of a new President, Dean of Faculty, Deans of Science Cent~r and Humanities Center, and a scheduling computer, will function even better next year. Perhaps a complete evaluation ()f the change will be possible by then. The students and their instructors agree that it is impossible to make a qualified decision on the merits of the change after so short a time.

Compassionate Lil:Jeral This man of the people, who is a truly com- passionate liberal, despite the machinations of the fr\str?ted :<nd desperat'on-struck Liberal Ptuty, .and one who has no further ambition than to serve the people of New York State as he has the people of his native Queens County as their- State Senator and District Attorney, and more rec€Thtly, the people of the City of New York as their Coun- cil President. He has the opportunity to provide the same leadership in achieving for New York Sta'e residents an enumtable tax program, based Oon progressive rather than the Rockefeller regressive taxation policies; the cleansing of our rivers and streams and air of pollution; the real care and curing of narcqtics addicts, the mentally ill and phY\sically disabled; the moderniza.ti()n of our S.tate government and actual cooperation with the Fed- eral government to gain the maximum benefits o-f their programs for State aid. The'se are a few <Jf the progressive ideas which Frank O'Conrtor bas advocated over the years. Failure Governor Rockefeller has failed.

Union College, . however,. is not society. It is rather .an institution run I:Jy an · organizational hiera-rchy. It is an institution attended by stu- dents who do not fit bhe mold stereotyped at Berkley, Gali- fornia but rather, who go aibout the business of discovering and devel•oping their own pers-onal- ities in their own way. This has been termed apathy. If so •then in all fairness, the Concor.dy's apocalyptic bent must be termed absurd.

On the surface, in the statistics, Union is among the finest institutions in the country. In strength of faculty, board scores of incoming freshmen, and size of endowment, Union ranks in the forefront. But something is missing. It is an imponderable. Part of it may be our stri_ng of losing football seasons, pa~ of it may be the scl':edulmg of sports events almost exclusively with schools which are far inferior to Union by every yardstick except athletics, part of it has been the .lack of the past administration. to provide tJ:e sense of ~!lotion and accomplishment, tbe failure to provide the tangible marks of excellence such as a major Ford grant or a significant number of National Merit Scholars or a single Rhodes. We see a gradual erosion of this sense of inferiority. President Martin has been a vigorous exponent of change and excellence, a man who has been a cultured and gen- erally enlightened chief executive for the college. Under his leadership, and to some extent (although ex- actly how far we cannot tell) because of it, the college is in the final stages of completing the most significant build- ing program in its history, and has smoothly transferred to a radically different and successful calendar. But the effects of these changes are still inchoate. Vandalism and drunkenness still characterize much of Union's \fun.\ We hope that this will diminish as the college begins to realize the possibilities for achievement which lie within its reach. No Place But Up They said it couldn't be done, but the 1966 Garnet is even worse than its predecessor. Happily, it appears that a better yearbook is on the way. Under Jack Stokvis and Co., the organization is get- ting out from under the long-time bear hug of one frater- nity control, a hug that has stifled and smothered all ini- tiative, all imagination, and all excellence. Almost by definition, the recent issues of the Garnet have been deficient, for the book must cover all facets of campus life. This should not imply that the staff must limit itself to reporting in a sterile manner which kills the interest inherent in the material. A yearbook can and should highlight that which is unique about a college. Through careful editing, with a eye not only to beauty and immediate beauty, the book as a while must, it it is to be truly successful, try to give focus and coherence to the myriad of detail. The 1966 yearbook provides a good technical base for improvement. It has larger pages, is sensibly bound along the long side which enables decent layouts to be arranged. The pictures, despite the total lack of taste in selection and the inanity of the slugs, are good reproductions. With this technical strength and tpe artistic and liter- ary promise of the 1967 staff, we can hope and expect a much finer product than this college has seen in many years. Moving your body around is highly inefficient. If communications were perfect, you would never have to. Of course, you would still have to get exercise. But that's your problem. We want to make it easier for you to contact people, learn. get information, attend lectures, and hold meetings. If communications were good enough, you could stay in the sack all day We developed Picturephone* service so you can see as well as talk when you call. And be s~en, too. We int~oduced Tele-Lecture service (two·way amplified phone calls) to let you hear lecturers in distant locations. And so you could ask them questions no matter 'how far away they were. Right now, many students can dial from their dormitories to a language lab. Soon a student will be able to dial into a computer thousands of miles away to get i11formation for his courses. Depending on the nature of the information, he might get his answer back audibly, printed on a teletypewriter, as a video image, or a facsimile print. Some of these services are available now. Others ar.e being tested. For the next week or so, better get a move on. *Service mark A~ T@ Bell System . & ~ American Telepl1one- & leler·•P and Assac-Jate-d c(l,...,f\1Mt4>~ .. ~ ~ I advoe editorial : the editoz ials that : ful, and t pus fee.li SJ \AM MD Tl~ WALTE~ rrrk'l\fl, \tbe ac( tos SP A~ 2 Di PAL HO 5-3 D J· s 'I . . .-- in - - WE in I sh, lJ· . ,.

First, he says that the editor-in- ch·ief is entirely responsible to the Administration f-or .the con- tents of the Con~ordien.sis and therefore exercises the .perrog:a- tive of writing the editorials. I do not follow this logic and know only that the ailln:inistra- tio'1 could not be more dissatis- fied wit? the editorials as they are wr1tten now. His sec-ond al;'gument is that he is always open to suggestions on the con~ tent of his editorials and the m~nner of its prese:ritatj.on, which h~· :is. However, since he SQ often completely disregards these suggestions for h.is offici8l whims, this. &lcond argument becomes completely meaning- less.

Often it was a ca~e of, \close but no score.\ Casserino Breaks Ice Sabbi Casserino broke the ice with a goal, as- sisted by Al Cowell. Later John Isaac scored to move the score to 2c0. He was assisted by Bill Lock. The final score was off the foot of Sid Abrahams, and Co\vell assi'Sted again. The En- gineers had 24 shots at the goal, as compared to 17 by the Garnet.

Chris Cassels kicked the extra point as Union went ahead 31-6. Interception In the final moments RPI linebacker Chip Sea- burg intercepted a screen pass thrown by reserve quarterback George Goth, and raced 10 yards for the score. 'I'\he conversion was ad<ied by John Contento. The game statistics bore out the final score as Union outgained RPI in total yardage 238-113, and held the Engineers to only 13 yard's on the grmmd.

KRAMER The prime object of Comt>I'e<nen- sive Education 10, \Freedom and Au- thority,\ is, according to Professor Ma:colm Willison, to identify and un- derstand \any limits we may wisll to impose on our own behavior and any which we cannot es-cape because we live in society.\ This course emphasizes criticism by the instructor of ma.ny short student papers, as well as personal dis-cU£- sions with the student of his Wl'itin·g. In this respect, Comp. Ed. 10 is an attempt to supplant the traditi'()nal freshman course in English C()ntposi- tion while sacrificing only its didacti- cism. The classroom situations de- emphasize monological lectUl'eS' and strive to bri.ng the student into the discussions so that he has the oppor- tunity to practice ora] communica- tion of sophisticated concepts. The general theme of \Freedom and Authority\ allows the facult-y to use those materials that they are per- sonally intere.sted in teaching- hom, which is not always possible in the courses encountered within a specific academic discipline. Joint Lectures The faculty members teaehing Comprehensive Education 10, have been meeting regularly to dis~uss this new course. Professor Willison of the Sociology Department is dil'ecting the coordination of the rom·se. One of the prime concerns of those fa-culty Continued on Page 5 Y.tmi:~t~;i~~l~~m1~tm§§Ei~'li:K=at::r$I..WWJ~mw::t~~;:rtJ~::H£~~~-~~~E:mu.:tXJ_:_:_:.:::_.x~ :: .;_ .. :;:; .. , :;;-;--,::;:~~~ni~~~m~£:&:n Frosh Bu(y U of R ReboundJng from an opening game defeat, the Union College Freshman football team swamped an under- manned University of Rochester team 68-8. It was as if the fmsh had heard Khr-uschev say \We will bury you\ and decided to do just that to their rivals. Overwhelmed went 8~ yards to score. The 2 point conversion, a pass from Pear.ce to Monahan, was goo:l, and the score \:as kno~ted at 8-8. The very next time Umon got the ball, it went 56 yards on the first play, a pa.ss from Pearce to Swan, to make the score 14-8. A 42 yard punt return to the 3 yard line by Gray set up the next score. From here, Leahy slashed his way over for the score.

The entire program will be written a~d recorded by Union students and Will be fed live to the network from the Union campus Monday evening, October 31. The third in a series of four pro- grams dealing with the November elections, WR.UC's effort will deal with key congressi<;mal races across the country. The first two programs re- ported on the gubernatorial and sena- torial races and were produced at WYBC on the Yale campus. Large Staff WRUC President Richard Ferguson will produce the program and Robert Killian, News Director, will direct the production. Enterv:iews with major na- ti~nal poli~ical figures are presently bemg obtained, and reports for cor- respondents as far as Calif()rnia will be recorded and edited at the Union radio station. A staff of twenty people ~vill be involved in the writing, record- mg and feeding of the political doru- mentary to the network. All twelve stations of the IVY Net- wvrk will be connected to the WRUC ~tudios by telephone long lines. IVY ~etwork executives and engineers will fly to Schenectady Monday afternoon to review the program and make final checks on the network. The IVY Network consists of all the Ivy League schools as well as Colgate, William'S, Lehigh, Rutgers and Union- Skidmore. Many IVY stations also broadcast on FM. The WRUC pro- gram will be heard in New York City, Philadelphia. Boston, New Haven and Providence. It is estimated that over 209,900 ;people will hear the broadcast origmatmg from the WRUC studios. The entire IVY Election Series is being spons()red by the Western Elec- tric Company an{} will climax with a six hour program election night, No- vember 8. Over 150 students from all IVY stations will meet in New Yo-rk City the day before the election to set up studios at Columbia University and make last minute preparations. WRUC's Bob Killian will head a dele- gation of Union and Skidmore stu- dents to participate in this program. The elect10n night se1·vice will be car- ried on at lea'st fifty stations across the country. PRICE 15 CENTS Samuels and White Air Different Views Samuels H.its Rocky State Education Howard Samuels brought the gu- bematorial campai·gn to Union Col- lege yesterday with a slashing, bitter attack on Governor Rockefeller. Describing the Governor as irre- .sponsible, politically partisan,. and dishonest with the public, h~ claimed that he and Frank O'Connor, on whose ticket Samuels is running for lieu- tenant governor, must be elected to give New York the modem govern- ment it needs. Criticizes Rocky Samuels outlined four basic areas in which he felt Rocl{efeller's per- formance has nat b-een up <to par. They are education, aid to the cities, the constitutional convention, and the political integrity of the preserut ad- ministration. Samuels derided the Goverll!or•s as- sertion that he has done a lot for higher education in New York State. Citing California as an example, Samuels said that New York had an equal number of college students as that state when Rockefeller first took office but now has slipped 250,000 s.tu- de!JJts behind. More State Aid Advocating spending four or five hundred million dollars more state aid to educa.tion immediately, and two billion more over the present three and a half billion by 19'70, h€ said that \We haven't really begun in educa- tion.\ This was attributed to Rocke- fe1ler's early insistance on \pay as you go.\ ;:)<A.utue-ls sa.id that the present finan- cial system of the state, relying pri- marily on the sales tax, is a regressive system putting the greatest burden on those least able to bear it. He sug- gest~d increased bonding as the hest form of finances, terming it an invest- ment in the future a:nd in human re- sources. Alternath.:rs to th~R would he an income bx and a $25 or $SO credit on the sales tax.

Most .of her talk was an exp]anation of her opposition to the Viet N:a!Il. war. \The major focus of our campaign is on the war. It is another instance of the American ruling class' attempt to prevent oppressed people frorn mov- ing forward and determining thei:r <>Wn affairs.\ She further stated, '~The so- cial revolution in VietNam is a dir-ect threat to the American ruling class.\ Socialist Worker Mi'ss White is running as a SociaJist Worker because she feels that both. of the two major parties are domtna.ted by \millionaires/' and termed both the Johnson peace offensive and reeent civil rights legislation fraudulent. The candidate felt that if the United States Constitution had been enf.()rced, there would have been no nee-d for civil rights legislation. Miss White ended her speech by calling for a socialist United States. She said that this would \preve::nt fu- ture Viet Nams\ and would be~ :real threat to the totalitarian socialism o.f Russia and China. Off the Streets The Socialist Workers Party bases its beliefs on the philosophy of Leon Trotsky, a Russian revolutionm~ whD was sent into exile by Joseph Stalin. Miss White holds a Bacbelor of Arts degree from Brandei·s Univer·sity and a Master of A1'ts degree from Boston l!niversity, where she taught anthropology. She currently resides in New York City. Miss White says that she is n<>t run- ning as a person with certain qualities, but as a believl:r in socialism. \They needed a candidate to run, and they asked me. I had the time, so I'rn run- ning.\ IFC Resurrects Paper,· O.E.P. Disagrees On Role By LEN KAGAN The Interfraternity Council has vot- ed to begin work on another eampus publication, in IFC newsletter. There is som~ disagreement as to what its role on campus will be, how- ever, J.ohn Mackey, President of Sigma Phi sees it as a stimulus to Concordy. But Dean of Students 0. Edward Pl}l- lock said he conceives of it a.:s an ad- junct to Concordy. Following the initial impetus at the meeting of Oct. 11, an organizational meeting was neld on Monday, 0 ctober 24, \vith approximately 15 people sign- ing up to work on the new paper. \This paper will be primarily run by fraternity men,\ according to Hu:nter Louis, IFC President, who announced that its co-editors will be Don Abood of Kappa Alpha and Bob Seigman of _ Delta Chi, both of whom will assume the organizational responsibility, \ Hunter Louis made this observation: J;here a~e m~ny people on e.ampus Wl~h prevwu·s hterary experiellce, vrh.o, ~o;. one reason or another, ba-ve not ~omed the staff of Concordiellsis.\'' It 1s hoped that these people win j<>in the staff o-f the IFC newspaper. \Student Voice\ T.he frosh .::arne from behind to prove that they may be tbe finest freshman football material ever as- sembled here.

The first half was 1·ebtively un- eventful. Neither team was able to move the ball consisten.tly. The only score came about when RoC'hester's Chapman .intercepted a ~ray p-ass and hustled it back 45 yards for- the sce>re. The two po-int convers:on from Mords to Glarke was !rOOd, and Rochester took and 8-0 lead into the dressing room. Inspired This one score was as close as Union came t() losing, for they came back in the second half t') play in- sph bd football. It was Jed by an illus- tri'DUS defensive eff01-t which held Rochester ,t'O only one first do-wn, and never let thein advance pas~ their own 37 yard line. · The avalanche began when, on the opening kicl~off. of the second half, Carlis011 Teceived a lateral from Swan, and with a key bJ.ock fr0om Monahan, By ROBERT SHAMIS Professor Manfred Jonas, associate professor of h:st()ry and dixeeto:r of tile graduate program in American Studies at Union, has completed a book entitled Isolati<misrn in America 1935-41. The book has been p111:Jli:shed by the Cornell University Press and will be released this Friday, October 28. In his book, Professor J-on;m; ex- p\ores the forces which led men of su~h divel'se political beliefs as the conservative Robert Taft, the S()Cialist ~orman Thomas, and the Communist Earl Browder to form a unHed front ag:J.inst American intervention in European affairs. The author also c;uz.&tions the positive. vie1vs of the United States in world affairs. which were implicit in the attLtud.es of the isot.ationists. Jonas surveys the neu- trality legislation of the 1930's and examines American abtitudes towards the Italian-Ethi-opian War and the Spanish Civil War. He traces isola- tionism in the 1930's back to the roots of anti-interventionism in American hist{)ry. Neo-lsolatiollism Professor J'Dnas concludes by com- paring i-solationism in th€ pre-World War II era with the unilaterism of contemporary right-wingers and the neo-isolationism of liberals who op- pose Amel'ican intervention in the Dominican :Republic and Viet Nam. He arrives at the verdict that while the isolationism of the 1930's is defensi- ble, i;;;ol!lltion-ist doctrines cannot be supported today when the possibility of nuclear attack pertains to every nation in the world. Con-tinued on Pag., 5 PROF. MANFRED JONAS Dean Pollock, advisor to tlte IFC had a somewhat different conception of the proposed newspaper. \It would not be a new publication. The IFC has been publishing a newslettel' 110tr and ~n for the past five years,\ he noted. Its purpose has been to ser-ve the fraternity system, by covering those news events of interest to fraternity men that the Concordiensis isn't able to cover, doesn't care to cover or doesn't cover sufficiently from t.he'fra- ternity viewpoint.\ He cited the ex- ample of the lack of coverage of' fra- ternity intramural sports e-vents. He further noted that sin<!e the IFC pub- lication doesn't serve the campus co-m- munity a's a whole, it has nev-<Er been entitled to student tax funds, and has always been supported by IFC m{)n-ey.

Ferry St. Prof. Sven R. Peterson, <:hairman cf the Department of PhiliJsophy a;t Union, acted as moderat()r for the dialog. Prof. WiHison gave a brief his- tory of Black Power, distinguish- ing between Black Supremacy, Black Nationalism, Black Pride, and black political activitie1s in Negro areas, and di'scussed what he considers to be a .pervel'ted form of Black Power prevalent today in the North. The 0righ1al intent ·of the term was to \inSJtill pl'ire\ in the Negro people in an attempt to destroy apa:thy and dissention from within. Willison explained how the term has be- come a war cry shou·ted by groups seeking to obtain desired ends through violent means.

Thus it is with a mixture of shock and horror that we view 'the results of the editorial entitled \Personal Propriety.\ The purpose of that editorial was to stimu- late debate on the proper bounds of administrative restric- tions on students who will soon be forc-ed to live in ·college dormitories. The debate it actually spawned was whether the newspaper should have the right to freedom of ex- pression, unfettered, except by civil law. Without exception, the letters we have received have skirted this issue. The writers have accused us of every- thing from irresponsibility, to advocating the violation of wives and daughters, to being pornographic. And to a man, including our backers, these writers have .igno~ed the question of the possibility that further rnodrficatlon of the social rules, involving a clear statement from the college that sexual mores are not and will not be its of- ficial concern, is desirable. In short, we are sorely grieved by the lack of matur- ity in this community - a lack which has, as yet: \pre- vented all rational debate on these issues. It is a sad com- mentary on the state of Urlion. Only Honesty The recent opening of the front door of the library is a welcome sign of the progress that is being achieved in the current development program. Tulloss To The Editor: I received today a copy of your editorial of September 29, 1966 and copies of the ensuing letters to the editor. I thought that I would be less than inter- ested in what happened at Union this year; but as things turn out, it appears 'that I really do have a stake in things to which I made some contribution last year. I was not at all surprised by the replies to the editorial, the writing of which I <take to be a rather courageous a.ct. I sec- ond Ken Kobland on the point that the editorial said something that had to be said--'brought an important point out into the open. But I h'ope that fighting with Prof. Craig over the use of a word and the protect\on of the chastity of his wife will not be the nexrt occupati-on of the Union community. If I am not completelv out of contact with the \new\ Union, I think that an import- ant area that Concordy and tfie student body should enter, an area in which you may be able to realize results much more quickly, is that -of how (in what spirit) the present rules are en- forced. You will probably never change Prof. Craig's point of view; but he is not the Dean of Students-The Enforcer. Why not chang·e the Dean? A major problem with last year',s regulati<ms is that they left the major emphasis of the ''shall nobs\ essentially mis- p-laced. I leave the present to the judgment of present stu- dents, ·but I know .tha;t in the past there has been too much emphasis on disciplining infrac- tors of social regulations involv- ~ ing women and much, much too little emphasis {)n punishing ( OT better helping to straighten out) those students who commit acts of violence o.r property de- famation. The number of sucih acts is well-known to students and to Dean Pollack, who has too often treated them ·81S good, ~'e::tn fun. The solution is for the .students to come up wibh a code for the Dean to folle>w in dealing with 1·ule-breakers 0of the various sorts. I think the present students, if they think along lines of what would be best to make a healthy psycho- logical environment at Union, know enough <to come up with a viable plan. But I suspect that if ·the students want their plan implemented sympatheltitcally they may V?ant, for ex~mple,_ a trained somal psycholQ~S!t (lib- eral of course) in the Dean's chai~. I would suggest that this is a possible, visible, achievable goal for the -student body. Sincerely, Rodham E.

I am not going ·to argue with the au~ thor of the recent note, neilther am I going to try to present tl1e issue as I see it. All this would be to no avail. I am also not going to come out wjth what would probably be conceived of by this person as a handful of subversiYe 'commie-rat' sen.ti- ments. I am going, however, to ask the ind:ividual and all those tru:]y interested, to rea.Uy ques- tion the matter as sincere.ly as . possible as well as to read the published matter concer.ning this issue. QUESTION! Ask yourself about the morality invo1ve·d in t)le MSU project. Ask what kind of ruler Diem was. As:k what type of government he led. Ask about the people of Vie.t Nam. Understand them, their culture, their religion. Then, .and only then, come out with o bserva- tions. Until then the obsewa- tions made are useless and pro- claim nothing but a per·S{)nal ig-norance concerning a problem that has and must plague all those who honestly search for peace. Marc S.

H.owever, the 1966 edition does not even appro.ach this meagre standard. lt is a collec- tion of snapshots, many of which predate 1965-66, and meaning- less ditties scrawled in the mar- gin.

As to the argument that this cuts down ()U the through traffic through the reading room, we feel that this is not an inconvenience to the users ()f that room of any great magnitude. Congratulations Last night's concert by Guimar Novaes was a breath- taking experience. She had a rnagnificent technique, the phrases tenderly or tempestuously rolling from her fingertips. In the cul- tural desert known as Scheneetady, it is only through im- ported artists such as Miss N ovaes that any semblance of civilized recreation can be achieve-d. Those individuals, both of the college and of the Sche- nectady Museum, who have helped bring talent of this caliber here, deserve praise of the highest magnitude. To The Editot·, Last week's editorial \Some- thing's Missing'' did a fine job of gen!'raliz:i:n.g a few of the ·more bas.ic probl!'ms that Union must fac!'. Although I concur with the hope and optimism that thE' editorial expressed towards President Martin's leadership in mef'ting these problems, I would ike to s!'e some specifir pro- posals. Sometimes, however, the let- ters a.-re more \thought provok- ing\ than the editorktls.

A solution to this problem, perhaps even better than this board, would be to get A.A. Milne to write them. Certainly his stories would be nleasing. And more than that, Milne could never be mO're than a \little radical\-after all Win- nie the Pooh is only thre!' o1· four feet high. Possibly more disturbing how- ever is Mr. Walsh's letter con- cern.ing Viet Nam. I have never since the beginning of the Viet N am controversy .sf' en collec.ted, with more Whi.te House charm and Pentagon grace, such cliches, crippled dogmas, naive reitterations and wet slogans as was so aptly collected for us by Mr. Walsh. It's a very pretty flag, indeed, but don't get too close lest it cover your eyes. Ken Kobland 68 Vietnam To The Editor: So once again the prolllem of the Viet Nam situati·0n has en- tered the Lettf'.rs to the Editor section of the Concord.iensis in a totally incorrect form!

They visited New Paltz Wednesday, and close out their season Friday with an encounter with a strong Middlebury squad at home. La·~t W Pclnp,o;oa v thPv cldl':tt<>d Hoc.hestE'r in a dridn~· rair h\' :I :-eor~ of ~-1 in 0\'<'t'time. Tim Bitting was the offensive star, scoring both goals. He tallied <>arly in the game, and after a third quarter Rochester goal tied it up, he scored again after less than three minutes of the overtime. The sloppy fielrl hindered the play of both teams throughout the game, and the :work of both goalies was commendable con'sidering the slippery ball. Bitting's goal no.>ed out Hobart, 1-0. ing still had a measure left. Cieninski intercepted yet another pass and sprinted 41 y:ll'ds for rthe score. It took Union on1y 6 plays to put another score on the board. This time Kumpf hit Forrest from 22 yards out for the score. It was now 62-8, but Union was noit quite d·one. Their n1~al score came a.bout when Cicotti intercepted an- other .pass and returned it 440 yards for the final score to make it Union 68-Rochester 8. -Pilote by Dick Don lei Right inside Doug Duval shoots at Hobart goal during boaters' l-0 victory last Saturday. Varsity Booters Drop 3 More; Offense Still Proves Ineffective The failure to build an effective offense once again this \VEek prevented the varsity boaters from achieving victory as they dropped three games. The Evansmen lost to Rochester, 3-2, Hobart, 2-0, and Middle- bury, 4-0, as the defense did a commen- dable job. The losses extended their losing streak to five and left their record at 1-6-1. a 3-2 decision to Rochester in the pouring rain on Daley Field. 'Union's play was highlighted by the fine play of 'Seveml sophomores. Goals were scored by sophomores Dave Barton and Mike Solomon. At Ve1mont Tuesuay the Garnet put up a fairly defent defensive effort but were again unable t,, score losing, 4-0. Evans May Make Changes Dr:fense St;ong Against Hobart Coach Evans is obviously discouraged by the losing season but stated that he had been amazed at the continuing fine effort of his playets. In an attempt to build a better offensive attack, Evans may move Larry McFarlane to the front line and put Jim Barlow at fullback. Evans cited the fine passing of Ting Pau Oei but then stated again that his plight was simply the lack of a \foot.\ In the Hobart game at Geneva Saturday the Statesmen scored two goals early in the first period on a pair of lapses. by the Garnet defense. After that, Union completely dominated the game, but they were unable to come up with the tallies. The Gat•net made 27 shots, and the 17 saves by the Hobart goalie indicated that the hooters were taking good shots. The Garnet defense was strong as goalie Toby Olsen had to make only three :>aves.

Letter: :'Nothing Missing' In Union Athletics • Though I do no!. objel't to thl' rwerall tone of your editorial \Something's Missing\ I must take exception to your state- ment that Union schedules sports e\·ents almost exclusively with SC'hools that are far infer- ior to us in every .fielrl hut ath- letics. I feel that this is far fNm the truth. In football our opponents include R.P.I., Ham- ilton, Williams, St. Lawrence, and Rochester, who ran hardly he called inferior to us ·schola:;- tically. f.n haskethall our tnt- ditional opponents are even more impressiYe with Midd·le- bury, Trinity, Wesleyan, M.I.T., and Amherst joining our foot- bali opponents. The point is that our athletic department sched- ules events with schools which though academically on a par with us, are superior in ath- letics due to their heavy t•e- eruiti-ng, athletic schola1·ships, and better drawing power due to prestige. Our 1965 football season exemplifies this fart as we had our best team in many \'eat·s hut due to the overall su- periority of our opponents, we only made a 4-4 record. I know that this paper likes to attack our athletic depart- :uent whene\'('r it ha3 u chance, hut I think it has looked in the wrong placP for that \some- Lhing ndssing.\ Actually the o.thletie department should be conulw! ,,J,·d f vl' its policy of maintainiH;.{ contacts with other prestigious schools rather than just searchiJlg for schools we could defeat easily as R.P.I. has done l'E'cently. In 1964-65 the Engineers played Niehols Business College of Massa-chu- setts, a small, academically in- ferior s~hool, and this year add- ed Haverford, a school with <mly one-tenth as many male stu- dents as R.P.I. I can not see how they can have pride in their 57-0 win over Haverford Sat- urday. Our athletic department has had the sense to stay away from such contests. I feel that such an error point.s out again the need for rev-iew of editorials by the senior board. I am sure some- one on the sports staff w-ould have raught )'Our basic en·or. Gary Prevost Garnet Bo-ws to Hobart, 7 -6; Faces Unbeaten Ephtnen Sat. In a game dominated by hard-hitting defensive play, .the football team was nosed out by Hobart, 8-6. Their record now stands at l-3-1; Saturday they face undefeated Williams. Hobart,. kno;wn as a running team this season, surprised the Union defense the :first time they had the ball as Hanna attempted a long pas's which Breck could not reach. After an exchange af punts he tried again, this ti.me connecting with the lanky end for a 55-yard scoring strike. Dick Rossetti kicked the extra point and Hobart led, 7-0. 1-~arly in the seconct quarter a Umon punt by Frank Pizzica rolled dead at .the home team's 8 ~·ard line. ln poor .field position, the Statesmen were forced to punt to their own 31. However the visitors were stopped on fourth down at the 24. Again the defen•se rose to the occasion, throwing Hobart for 2 consecutive losses. The subsequent punt from the end zone was partially blocked and went out of bounds at the Hobart 27. Poor Punt After a poor punt by the Statesmen, quarter- back Bob Utecht, who had been relying on the running of Joe James and Jim Ramich up till then, opened up a little and hit Dill with a side- line pass for a first down ut the 15. Ramich, still hampered ·somewhat b:v an injured shoulder, drove to the 10 and then to the 8 on two sweeps. James, u sophomore fullback, slashed to the 3 for a first down. On the next play, Ramich swept in for the score. Coach Flood then gambled and decided to try for a 2-point conversion. The sweep by Ram• ich was smothered by a host of Hobart tacklers; Hobart led, 7-6. Morley Runs Draw Play Early in the third quarter pass interference penalties gave both teams fil'st downs in good position, but the defenses were superior again. Then with Hobart on their own 46, Morley brought the erowd of 3,000 to its feet .by breaking into the clear on a draw play and :finally being stopped on the 12. Three plays put the ball on the 5, and brought up fourth down. An attempted tackle- eligible pass fell incomplete in the end zone, halt- ing the threat. The fourth quarter opened with Union punting to the Hobart 21. Again Hanna. and Breck teamed up, this time on an 67-yarder to the 12.

Announcement of the plan by President Harofd C. Martin set in motion the first general fund-raising efFort in Union's 7 77 ·year history. Martin said he expected to have $12.5 million of the total in hand three years from now. Dr. Martin also informed the group that o stiJI.grow.ing nucleus fund of $1.5 million has already been pledged by members .of the Boord of Trustees. Key speaker of the e.vening was Harry K. DeWitt, president of the Chicago-based American Hospital Supply Corporation and an active philanthropist. DeWitt, 1928 gradu- ate of Union, criticized the notion that smallness is necessarily a virtue in <1 liberal arts college. Martin termed the drive an \en- lfglltened adventure\ in keeping with post historic ventures of the College. H.e called the effort a necessity. The $30 million which Union hopes to raise will be ploughed into four basic areas: educational proeram, new buildings, renovations and land acquisitions. and laboratory resources. A final $2.5 million will support an enlarged scholarship .I:Judget. A total of $8 million has been ear- marked for neiV buildings. Present plans inClude a Science and Engi- neering Center, a College Center, a Gymnasium abutting the present Field House, artd Arts Center, a Service Building, and an addition to Schaffer Library. While aclding new buildings, Union plans to rnake the necessary outlays to presewe its fine olcf buildings!: Renovatiom totaling $2.3 million are planned for North College, Nott Me- morial, NortiJ Colonade, the present geology quanters and Old Chapek A:umni Gymnasium will be converted into on Adrr~inistration Building.

Of the $19 mil- lion scheduled for this sector, $13 mmion is slated for improved faculty ~;a/aries, enlargement of faculty and staff and research. Another $3.5 mmion will be used to fund new pro- grams and supply supporting library The CoJiese has conducted fund drives in the past, but none to match the present effort in size or type.

Y., FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2S, 1966 PRICE 15 CENTS across the significant a product since years, but nurtured Alumnus Gives Ideas on College~ Business n. these Nhat to an in 'reality !!-bout by man The following are excerpts from Harry De- Witt's, '28, address tonight at the dinner kicking olf the fund drive. When President Martin first asked me to talk on this subject, there was in my mind a faint suspicion that -what he really had in mind was the importance, and value, of Union to business- not just all col- leges. Now, if we try to measure the value of our Colle-ge to business, we have no choice but to look at its -value to its graduates. Business is people. If a business is sta:fl'ed with outstanding people, it can't fail; if it is composed of inefficient or ineom- petell't people, it can't succeed .••. If we are to judge the value of any institution-to business, we must use as a basis C>f judgement the quality. the character and the abilities of men it . turns ()Ut. I suggest that among Union's g:vaduates · there is as high a percentage of men who have brought credit both to themselves and to their busi- nesses and profe·ssions, as will be found in the grad- uates C>f any othe:i' school. Some years back, a very wise old man in the tele- phone company for which I then worked, [told] me, \Harry from now on I want you to hire n{)th- ing but vice presidents. This is our policy, and to this you must adhere.\ .•• The first place we look, obviously, for vice pre'sidents, is in the ranks of col- lege graduates. To look anywhere else would be sheer folly. In looking for these vice presidents, we've learned some curious things. One is that the college usually makes a very noticeable difference in the nature, eharacter and ability of the man. Generali:?jations at'e l'isky, but we conduded some years ago that we would be wise to discontinue recruiting at a number of institutions, some of which are reasonably prom- inent, As a general premise, those colleges from which we no longer recruit seem to have concen- tra·ted more on hammering facts into the skulls of their ·students than in developing the attitudes we are seeking. It's difficult tC> describe all of the attitudes we seek. Eut, here are some: Gifts Through The Years Help Keep Union Solvent The success of Union College's just announced drive for $30 mil- . lion v.rill depend on many modest gifts and a few very large ones. In the past Union has been fC>rtunate in receiving those vEry large donations that push a fund drive to final success. Some of these· major gifts have endowed professursh~ps, some have created scholarship funds. some have built buildings. All have been essential in attracting- the schoLars and students Union ~now ha-s. Frank Bailey T!te largest individual benefac- tor 'Union has had was Frank Bailey, the Co.Jlege's treasurel\ from 1901 to 1953. During his unequalled 52 years as treasurer. i: he generously endowed three pro- . fessl>'rsllips and made other gifts totaling -$1.5 mi)li()n. Upon his death, his estate left another $1.1> millioli to the College. usually large distribution of funds. Union h~s received a nwnber of donations in the half-million dollar range. In 1960, Trustee Henry Schaffer gave the College $50J,OOO to build Schaffer Li- brary. Last year the James Foun- dation also gave the College $500,000. ): ears ago the General Educa- tion Board granted Union $425,- 000. And, near the end of his rec- ord tenure as President, Eliphalet N ott made the College a gift of some $600.000 worth of property. Endowed Chairs James A. Royce donated $116,852 in 1964 to estabHsh another major scholarship fund. In 1960 the be- quest of Seward D. Hendricks es- tablished yet another major fund with $126,363. A major souree of aid to needy students was established with the Frank Bailey, Jr. Memorial Fund. A gift of nearly $162,000 sbarted this continuing source of student loan funds. Union can count many other major gif.ts. This year alone, the estate.s of Lester T. Hubbard and Walter E. Kruesi have, respec- tively, provided the College with $150,000 and .$;1.18,412. H. Melville Hanna i , Mrs. R.ussell .Sage, wife ·of the man fo.r whom Russell Sage Col- lege in Troy is named, gave Union its second largest gift. Her will, tr nusually large sums of money are required to permanently en- d<Jw a professorship. Uni<m now ha.s four major endowed profes- sorships.. Past Treasurer Frank Eailey and his wife, Mal'ie Louise, endowed three of them with $150,- 000 apie.ce. These are for physics, mathematics and Greek, Latin and ancient languages. A fourth major professorship, in English literature, was endowed by Tho..,,.s Lamont's gift of $200,000 in 1948. G1vmg money so that future w01'thy but needy scho·lars can ge-t an education has always been an objective philanth{)'})ists. in higher education. William C, Got- shall established suc'h a scholar- ship fund for Union engineering students with a gift of $160,522. Though less well known to his- tory than his brother Mark, H. Melville Hanna wa5 no less gen- erous. A Union graduate of the Class of 1860, he amassed a for- tune of his own and later gave the College $100,000. James Brown, also a rnan of considerable means, fave Union a similar g.ift in 1878. In 1964, Walter C. Eaker con- tributed a gift of a quarter of a million dollavs. Baker has given Union long service !lS cl1airman of the Board of Trustees and over the years has provided the Col- lege gifts in kind amounting to another quarter of a million dollars. m~·de public in 1918, left the Col- A lege $800,000 for general endow- ment. Th.e next largest gift to the College came _not from an indi- .. vidual but a foundati<tn. In 1957, the F1>rd Foundation gave Union the stun of $574;000 in an un- To quote Dr. Angell, or perhaps to misquote him, \We seek men whose attitude shows they have learned the primary purpose of educa- tion is not just to help them earn their bread, but to make each mouthful sweeter.\ Harry K. DeWitt was the key speaker at tonight's dinner announcing the new fund drive. {2) (3) They exhil>it a reasonable respect for the ideas of others, but an equally l'easonable insistence on the dght of each man to develop his own ideas. They show a willingness to accept values o£ 1 - thin~s Ol' concepts a:s they exist, but also the inqu1sitiveness that a~ks why these things or ideas need perpetually to be regarded as verities. (4) They are characterized by a regard for those attitudes that have existed for many years,- but a conviction that the only thing that is permanent;: and constant is change. We have a .:onviction in our particular business that these things are more generally found in the smaller colleges and in the liberal arts colleges~ those colleges where there is at least a strong lean- ing toward the humanistic curriculum and. not the mere presentation of facts. . CDntinued on Page 2 Eight million dollars are earmarked for six new buildings: a new gym- nasivm, an addition to Schaffer Li- brary, a College Center, a S'Cience and Ensineering Center~ an Arts Center and cr service building. The $4 million Science and Engi- neering Center would alloiV the sci- ences and engineering to pool their _ resources lor a more efficient use or· space and talent. Ninety thousancJ:: square feet of classroom and labora- tory space wovld be adcled to form a complex: connecting Bailey, Butter- field, anc! Steinmetz halls arid the electrical engineering bvilding. Estimated cost, inclucling equipt menl, for tile Science and Engin· eering center is $4 million. Joining engineering in the new Center would be geology, chemistry, biology, phy• sics and psychology. A Colle-ge Center, to provide for out-of-cf<1s.s octivity~ is plcrnned at a cost of $1 rnillion. The Center would be used as EJiace for casual meeting of students and faculty, club meet· ings, stvdent newspaper, and literary magazine staFFs and alumni gather- ings. Andrew Carnegie Hall would be remodeled for the Center. An ex· tension would be added for a 550- place dinfng room overlooking Jack· son's Garden, several other dinine rooms and a kitchen. An Arts Center, estimated at $900,· 000, is planned to accommodate Un· ion's growins D.epartment of the Arts, The burgeoning arts program, now faced with \inadequate quarters,\ will require mo~e space ancl facilities in which its work of teaching, creaf· ng and performing can be carried on. Plan11ed are new studios, prac· tice and performance rooms, a small gaiJery and an auditoritJm large enovgh to accommodate concert and theatrical audiences. The College estimates it will cost $500,000 to build and equip an ad- dition to S<:haffer Library. The Li· brary's present capacity of 300,00() volumes is to be doubled. St!Jdy car- rels will crlso need to be dovbled in number. Roomr; for faculty studies will be addecl.

Toward Greatness The significance of the new fund raising program that was announced tonight will depend, not on wha.t is pro- jected in speeches, important .as those are, but in the spirit in which the program is run through<>ut the ten years it spans. Yet, the speech of Dr. Martin tonight is an encourag- ing sign, an indication that the spirit will be one of en- lightened liberalism and progressive e-ducation, Money may not be the primary rngredient in provid- ing the environment necessary for the educational experi· ence, yet it would be foolish to undere:stimate its influence in facilitating it. But the dapger always is that the money will become the primary object and the students secondary. We. be- lieve we can see this happening with t:he forced movement of students from off-campus living qMarters to the new dorms. If we can judge by the statements concerning this present drive, this danger will be avoioded. The ern:phasis on increasing the endowment is: the most significant of these signs. A college is only as strong as its students and faculty: a good a<bninistration can be good only in so far as it can obtain these two requisites. And money, for salaries and for scholarships, is an im- portant ingredient in this process. Considerably less importm.\t is the physical plant. Somewhat obsolete, Union's campus has been a pretty but inefficient house for learning. Its fa;.cilities are old and overcrowded, and, in some cases, such as a student union, non.existent. The funds set aside for improving these areas of the college will be well-spent. In short, we see this as an attempt for greatness. We have often said in the past that Union stands on the crossroads with the path of mediocrity and the path of excellence before it. We hope that the entire college com· munity, including students, alumni, faculty, parents, and administrati()n, will join hands in orde:r to make the latter path the one finally taken.

DeWitt. • • Cont:nued from page 1 Liberal arts colleges are not bet· ter for being small .... In my lay- man's judgement, the thing that makes the difference i~ the quality of teaching, - plu·s ·an environ- ment that is conducive to both teaching and learning. It is these two things, in my opinion, which determine whether a college will send out young men with heads full of facts, - or will graduate men who have acquired the happy fac- ulty of thinking logically and sensi- bly. And it is these things which the liberal arts college can offer so well .... Only some of the thipgs college did for me can be precisely out- lined .•.. but look at yourself. I doubt there are ten of you in this room who could say in truth you would have progressed to your present position had you quit school after high school graduation, And if you can't say this, it stands to rea:son that your coll~ge must share some of the crecJ.it for the positions you now occupy. But further than this, I suggest that there are not 10 ()f you in this audienee who can say, in truth, you are not a better citizen and a · better person than you would have been had you not gone t_o college. . •. . If Union did have a part in huild- mg not only you but your business p_rofit and credit, I suggest that perhaps you, even as I have an ob- ligation to that college. Ca:mpaign' s Major Beneficiary To Be 'The Endowment . Th_e folJowing are excerpts from P!es_Jdent Harold C. Martin'S speech· k1ckmg-ofi' the . fund-drive . Tonight .we officially begin something that prm,rnses t~, be the single biggest venture m the his~ory of Union ·College, W_e _prop~se to raise twelve .and a hall m1ll10ns m the next three yeal'S' we propose to raise $30 mil-lion in the' next ten yea1~s. There are three grounds of nece:;sity:. so}vency, cC1mpetition, an<l qua!rty. The formula for excellence is the. same the world over: enthusiasm; coprage, hard work, good resources. We have a go_?d deal of all four going for us. The chxef suppor~s. for the operating ~udget 11re two: tuition and endowment mcome •. We_ raise? tuition this year; we sh-all raise 1t ag.am two years from now· · and again two years later. Our endow~ m~nt incorpe last ;vear was $1,1:50,838. Without th1s campaign, we might reason- ably project an increase of about $63 122 a year. from that source. The gap' ,be~ tween mcome a.nd expense can be less. e;ned in only three ways: (1) raising tui- tion mo1·e frequently or more drastically· (2) cutting down on the quality of ou~ program; or (3) adding to erid'owment. we. mar be able to effect some econ- omles-mdeed, we succeeded in doing so la:st year-but no one here I am sure ~ants to· settle for cutting back on qual~ Ity. We must add to endowment. Endowment The eapi~al campaign plan provides that two-thuds o.f what it raises will go to endowmen-t: endowment for suppor<t of the central operatin?>' budget, which is what I have been talkmg about, essenti- ally endowment for the support of first- rate faculty; .e~dowment to provide some schol~rly P?st.tiOn~ through name·profe·s- sorships, d1stmgu1shed enough to bring ternporm·y and permanent members of faculty ;to our campus; endowment to underwrite _new vent~res after they have proved the1r value m an experimental stage, the point at which foundation sup- port often disappears and even the best programs are likely to be dropped or to die of undernourishment. The plan provides for a substantial in- crease in the endowment fnr scholarhips. Unless we want to be~ome a rich man's college, which is certainly no part of our tradition,_we shall have to strengthen our s·holm·slup resources every time we raise tuition. This scholarship expense is at bottom one of the most important ~xpenditure~ we make for quality. The campaign plan provides for addi- tions . to our physical p:lant and to our teachmg equipment. This is the most visible and inevitably the most glamdrous pa1't of ·the program. Our laborati>-:ries are forty, fifty, and sixty years old; ·they are over·crowded and inconvenient; they rore sep!lrated and therefore ine[fident. We pro :pose to teat• down, ,build, add on and renovate until we have a comple~ on the orrder of the campus development map. If we can get started on it next ~utnm~r and ·can ;move through e<ach ste:p m qurck succession, we believe we can· do all of what must be done for about· four million dollars. College Center The other immediate priority build- ing is a College Center. Insid!= the present building of Andrew Carnegie Hall, changes in interior ar- rangement would convert the c;lassrooms and ~ffi-ces and laboratories intoispa:ce for meetmg rooms and workroo>n fo'.r various student activities. Here students' amJ fac~ ulty and alumni would find a bu1lding suitable for their common and separate purposes. Three more bu!ldings lie ahead of us in the immedia.te future. Our fine new Pbrary, larg-ely the gift of one trus·tee is alre.ady taxed for space; an additio~ extendmg east from the rear of it will cost at least a half-million dollars. Alumni gymnasium, built 50 yeat,s ago is still an attractive and. usable strue~ ture, but it is far too small for the needs of our student body -and faculty. We have a :p:an for a gymnasium to lead off the front .of the Field House. I The fifth new structure needed i~ one for the !lrts-for music, for theatre, for the fine arts \:hich pogerther comprise c-!1-e department m our present organiza- iwn. Th:e t}).ird and fou;th parts of our. plan provi-de for renovations and for acguisi- tion of land. We should unquestionably preserve the oldest piJ.rts of our archi- tectural inheri-tance, as the trustees :have been doing piece by piece for many years. .The la'st part -:- land..acquisition - brx~gs me full circle to the point from wh1ch I began. WhiJJt w~ feel the .greatest need fo1\. right now is land for playing fields. I~ run!? ag~inst our own history and agamst t:Pe history of other institutions to think that Union College will be an en- terprise <;>f the ·same shape tomorrow as it is .toilaY· I am convinced that none of us wo~Jld want it to be so. And beoo.use I am convinced of that I am also con· vi:~J.Ced ~hat t~n!ght, the opening night of th1-s thi:ty-milllon-~ollar campaign, is a great m~ht for Umon College.
