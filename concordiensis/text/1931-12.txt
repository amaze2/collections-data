The past two weeks has seen tense feelings between China and . Japan, and many evidences of anti- Japanese feeling hereabouts. The boycott of Japanese goods and ser- vices is particularly acute and ef- fective, against official protests of the Japanese Government which seems to feel that China should not retaliate in her most effective way. It ls my good fortune to have )Jeen invited to participate in the deliberations of the Institute of Pa- cific Relations and I am enjoying very much the opportunities afford- ed thereby. The other college dele- ~ates are Chamberlain Of Columbia, Quigley of }Minnesota and President Comstock, so Union is In good com- pany. One of the Japanese delegates (Professor Takayanagi of Imperial University, Tokyo) raised the ques- tion whether Ohina is a sovereign state inasmuch as she pos~esses no effective government. The Chinese seem inclined to assume that China is sovereign ari!} so the discussion proceeds. ·Also, Japan feels that the League is too remote and unin- formed concerning Eastern ques- t;iqns to be dictating policies, and ad.vo~a,tes a semi-independent Asia- tic or .Pacific ~association of nations. 'i'iieri!\ seems: ~tb ;be doubt that the Manchurian incident was created by Japanese military chiefs without specific provocation of the type al- leged although Chinese procrasti- nation and evasiveness provides suf- ficient provocation of a more gener- al sort. At present I am too occupied with Institute sessions· and reports to write at greater length, but it is forecast that Japan will not with- draw from the League (nor from Manchuria) and that some mutual- ly· satisfactory investigatory com- mission may be formed. It is well recog!lized, however, that both Russia and the United States must be included in any group which pre- tends to suggest a permanent solu- tion.

They are also conscious of tl1e powedul in-fl-uence that public opinion exerts on college fa.culties and college administrations.

The last suggestion of the committee was that a committee be ap- pointed to advise younger memhers of faculties ' and study the purposes and aims of each course Such recent activity in the intellectual group comes only after long clamor of the students and finally the public taking up the cry.

Dewey's duties consisted of collect- ing the tuition and rental fees of tlle students, superintending the r.naintenar1ce and repairs of the physical property of the college, purchasing all the supplies, and also supervising the expenses of the undergraduate organizations. Since Mr. Dewey came to Union in 1908 various changes have oc- curred oiL the campus. In 1908, 250 students paid a varying tax from $60 to $90, the engineers pay- ing the hjgher sum. Today Union has an enrolhnent of 840 students who pay a tuition o:+ $350 each. Since 1908 the Butterfield Memorial chemistry building, civil engineer- ing buildLng, the Memorial Chapel, Bailey Hail!, the Aluxpni gymnas- ium, Alexander and Graduate Coun- cil athletic fields, John Howard Payne Ga.te, and several fraternity houses ha.ve been built on the cam- pus. NaturaLly the work as assistant treasurer required that ha closely scrutinize all expenses of the col- lege as w-ell as insist on proper re- payment of all loans made to stu- dents. Such work often caused un- popularity with students, but his CCa.nbinued on F<llge Four) (Cont:intied on Page.
