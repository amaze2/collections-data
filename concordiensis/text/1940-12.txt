Willkie, who was the main .speaker at the conference dinner President Fox stated that 'if Mr. Willkie campaigns again he may find an academic record a serious handicap. There is a good deal of suspicion now attacking educators from the little red school house to the White House\. TheJe- fOle he inferred it would he a dis- 3.dvantage for the defeated candi- Ja te to see!{ a position as a college president. Dr. Fox defended American edu- ~ation against .the critics who have declared that it has \enervated the American character\ and broken down \individual self confidence\. He declared that American oppor- tunities ate still plentiful and that American civilization ean go for- ward just so long as it wants to. He praised the fraternity as be- ing \one of the soundest and most effective instruments for the train- ing of good citizens by developing with its own house and table, a training school in the art of living together. The business of the meeting con- ~ernPd the future welfare of college fraternities in the country. College fraternities from now on will .be limited to those educational insti- tutions accredited by the Associa- tion of American Universities from the installation of new chapters, according to a constitutional amendment passed at the confer- ence.

These men have been the tentative \first five\ almost from the beginning of the court s·essions almost a month ago. However, Nitchman is highly en- couraged by the work of some other men who will undoubted!)\ be heard from, possibly before the season actually gets under way.

Yet it hapuened last Friday when the members of Mr. Gordon Rust's Freshman English clas~ labored for· fifty minutes to find the non- existent errors in paragraphs and Eentences that ·represented the answer~ in,;tead of the ex- amination . In New York at the time, Mr. Rust had Cadman Hislop of the English department proctor the exam. Previously, he had left the draft of the exam to be multigraphed and also another draft containing the answers. l'n- stead of multigraphing the cor- rect draft, the secretary printed the answers and gave them to Mr. Hislop to pass out. Only a few in the class left the exam alone, Mr. Rust said. Not daring to look at tne rest o • the papers which were we!. marked up, he promised another hour exam.

On Monday, how- ever, when he was informed there would be mole !'han 200, the sixty- nine-yeat· old scientist worked late into the night to complete tha<t num'ber. There wer·e many alumni who missed theil· planned trains to suburban towns after the dinner was over .because they were so en- grossed in attempts to ><olve the puzzles. Berg Talks Informally Dr. Berg entertained. the alumni with ~ series of personal anecdotes from th.e time he was a youngster Abraham S. Weber·, Budget Di- rector of the State of New York, lectured to the class on Tuesday from two to five.

S. 50, and one in Dr. Bennett's class in Labor Move- ments, he will take luncheon with :nembers of the Division of Social Studie-s. Miss Camille Staneska will arrive in Schenectady late Saturday eve- ning tryouts for parts in the Mountebanl\s spring play, \The In- spector Genet·al\ a play unusual in the fact that it offers 19 parts oi which 11 are full roles starring each almost equally. Lectures .Monday Night Dr. Polan:; i's only public lectut e of the coming visit is scheduled ·for Monday evening in the Old Chapel The lectur·e. which is to begin at 8 p. m., will .be on the subject \Can World Economy Be Restored?\ On Tuesday morning, the lecturer will make his appearance in Daily Assembly at 10 o'clock, speaking on an undisclosed topic. Following this, he will conclude his visit here with a lecture in Dr. Joseph D. Doty's course in English History. The Institute of International Education, which is sponsoring Dr·. Polanyi's lectures this year, is an organizat-ion, with headquarters in New York City, which is devoted to the spteadifig of educational facil- ities beyond the political bound- aries of the world today. - ------0---~ Hartnagle, '98 Named New State Geologist Dr. Chl'is A. Hartnagle, '98, was appointed State Geologist, effective December 1, in an announcement made ·public yeeterday hy Dr. Er- nest E. Cole, CommisEioner of Edu- cation. Rounding out a third nf a century of service in the Geulogy Department, Mr. Hartnag-1<' >UC- ceeds D1·. David H. Newland. who retired last summer. He has been acting he 1d vf the department since last summer. In his thirty-five year interval Dr. Hartnagle has wt·itten various bul- letins and pahmphlets nn the gPn- eral and economic geology of New York state. Born in Newark, N. Y. in 1874, Dr. Hartnagle wa:o gradllaled from Union College in 1898 and from the New York State College ~or Teach- er;:- in Albany in \'.900. While Parn- ing his master's de~;ree at Columbia University in 1904, he becam~ a Fellow of Geology. Graduatmg m 1905, he entered tht• offices of the New York State Geologist, where he has remained since. The 11 full roles give a wide op- portunity for parts to actors witt previous experience, while the eight smaller pal ts, which are b:, no means \walk-ons\ give ample oppm·tunity for inexperienced ac- tors to gain experience under a Broadway actor and director. Tryouts will be at 7;30 Saturday and Sunday evenings in the Mountebanks theatre. It is prefer- able, and a fuller opportunity will be given, if tryouts attend both meetings but a full opportunity to demonstrate in every part talent will be given at either. Large, Varied Cast Five officials. a hospital commis- sioner, a school superintendent, the mayor. the judge, the postmaster, and the police chief, are five of the 11 leading characters. They have the roughness, weakness and petti- ness typical of Russian provincial officialdom. Thoroughly inafficient and grafting, they are thrown into a panic that one of the czar's in- spections is about to descend upon them. Their desperate and con- fused effot·ts to cover up their shortcomings under the mayor's leadership provide the play with much of its best material and cer- tainly several of its most prom- inent roles. The two landowners, the stupid and inseparable, Bobchinsky and Dobchinsky, have parts which are as important as those of the offi- cials and offer great opportunity of \'hick peasant characterizations. Perhaps the largest part, if any, in the play, is that of Hlestakov, the young and dashing official whose arrival in the town is r·e- sponsible for the predicament of the officials. Hlestakov is at the same time weak, ingenious and ap- pealing. His invented stories. his love making with the mayor's daughter, and his high handed treatment of the officials, provide the actor and the role with contin- uous and varied opportunity. Miss Staneska will :be the guest of Professor and Mrs. Burges John- son while on the campus. Robert K. Killian, '42 and Wi!l- .am R. Kreusi, '42, will superintend _he transfe1· of the proceeds of the ~ollection. The reception and dinner at Hale ::rouse at·e being arranged by Al- bert S. Callan. '41, John A.

Radio Broadcast Planned The Union College Radio Work- shop has volunteered .its services to the Student Committee for Democ- racy in making technical anange- ments for the Empire State Town Meeting of the Air. The broadcast, from 3:15 to 3:45 on Sunday afternoon, December 15. will be conducted :by the Committee in the round. The topic of the town meeting will be, \What Can College Students Do for Democracy and National Defense.\ A series of short speeches by Committee repre- sentatives will be followed by a genet·al discussion in which the audience will participate. Fox to Introduce Group The student chairman of the broadcast will be At·mand V. Fei- genbaum, '42. The program will be introduced by President Fox.

In this category belongs l'nion's: festive cmol :;ing which in the past has been one of our most sueeessful campus fumtions ami umlouhte<ily will continuE'' to be in the future. Community carol singing is a European relic of the :\Iiddle; Ages perhaps of even nn eal\lier progeny. It has progre.ssed ! through the ages and has been enriched in its course a.s new interp1·etations, additions and 1 e\·isions were given to carols. In the ~ ew \\'odd t IH' custom nearly lost its un iwrsali ty and ~·early recUITHnee.

From a Concordiensis of the past we quote: \Sunday night we saw this fine tradition (in l'Pfe1·ence to the community carol sing) culminate<i in a momentous enterprise, involving the voices of many thousands of people in a mass grand- choir. Our college is embarking on its greatest ti·adition. Our exchange scholm·s, whether they l'etain anything else or not, will retmn to their native la.nds with the lasting im- i pression of the::-;e inspiring· ceremonies. The guests of the· college will retnin longer than a.nything else the knO\vledge of these festivities. It will make an imprint on the college and on the communit,v which we hope will be irradicable.\ The greatest tradition upon which the college embmked at the time the a·bove quotation was written haR lasted and, if anything:. been strengthened. Guests of the college and' especially our exchange students have retained the knowl- edge of these festivities. A week from Sunday night we will· ag·cdn be given the opportunity to enjoy the community carol sing from the campus and may witness fot• ourselves why this event has come to lJe one of l_lnion's most inspiring! ceremonies. We ul'ge one hundred percent cooperation with : Dl'. Tidmarsh and our student leaders in doing· l_lnion's part· to continue this grand tradition.

If the drive and enthusiaHm displayed by Nels' charges were all that counted on the court tlw team should be a world beater. How~?vcr, in the informal practice :<amt•s p:ayed this week with a ,;ick~il te:J.m from Albany, the team, thoug-h showing improvement in each game, still has a long way to ;:o to assume the state of perfecti•l:J. The squad has shown a dPfin:te lack of being able to make both its set shots and layups good fot· two points. Even then thP layups have been few as the Dutchmen's offense was for the most part un- able to pen~?trate vpt·y nPar thP bas- l,et. Pa~sine:. too, has rPceived its share of cl'iticism from Nels r.F the bali handling has b~?en rougn and ragged.

The dialogue is fast moving and its provides the audi- ence with much ground for laugh- ter. The picturization of the very crooked small town officials who are frightened out of their wits when, an Inspector-General comes to investigate their city is very similar to the situations that exist in some of our more modern Amer- ican towns. Following the three night show- ing of the play in the Mountebanks Theatre the cast will begin a week's trip which will include one night stands in the Capitol District and other towns in the Northern New York Sta:te area. Miss Staneska who has become a freqUent visitor to the campus since her affiliation with the Mo- hawk Drama Festival will perhaps again displa:;- her talents to Sche- nectady audiences if she takes one of the female roles in the play. Lunch with Directress The members of the executive committee of the Mountebanks had lunch with Miss Staneska in the Hale House dining hall before she left for New York. Many towns- people who have seen the directress in her many productions for the Festival, came to the campus .to pay their respects to the actress. Many others who could not spare the time greeted her, however, when they met her on the street . Many of these fans also offered her the facilities of their homes during her stay on the Union Col- lllge campus. Miss Staneska wnP much enthused with the reception given her both by the townspeople and aspirants for \Inspector Gen- eral\ roles. Monday afternoon the directress left the campus for her home in New York but she will return agam in the near future to assume full charge. Until she does resume her work here Mr. Gordon Rust, faculty adviser of the play group, will conduct the rehearsals. • • tfltStS Begun Em playrnent Talks UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N.

News spread like wildfire last night that Clair C. Smith of the freshman class had contracted the fever and that Delta Phi fra- ternity, of which he is a mem- ber, had been quarantined for a week. This news was verified by Dr. G. Marcellus Clowe, college physician, who explained that Smith had been removed to the isolation hospital and was not in a serious condition. Dr. Clowe said that residents of Delta Phi wi11 not ·be permitted to attend classes for a week, and that the fraternity's intramural athletic activities have been postponed . College Obtains Play Recordings English Division Uses Shakespeare Discs For Class Instruction Aid A new method of teaching Eng- lish literature was inaugurated at Union today when students study- ing Shakespeare met in the Moun- tebanks Theatre this afternoon at 4:30 to hear recordings of the Eng- lish playwright's well !mown com- edy \Twelfth Night.\ The public is also invited to hear the recordings. Dr. Karl Polyani Concludes Visit Affirms the Necessity In the World for an Economic Order Soon Dr. Karl Polyani, noted European lecturer and student of the social sciences, concluded his two day visit to the· campus this morning with an address in Daily Assembly, and a discussion before Dr. Joseph Doty's class in \English History.\ In his chapel address Dr. Rolyani pointed out the paradox that exists in the world of today. He stated that it is unusual not that world democracy is facing a crisis, but that it has been able to stand up under it so well. The weakness of democracy, he said. is due to the breakdown of the old 19th century economic system. Dr. Polyani arrived Sunday and was entertained by Dr. Benjamin P. Whitaker and Dr. Frederick L . Bronner of the Division of Social Studies that evening. On Monday morning he addressed Dr. Harold A. Larrabee's class in \Social and Political Philosophy\ and Dr. Wil- liam W. Bennett's class in \The Labor Movement.\ Luncheon Guest He was guest of the Division of Social Studies at its weekly lunch- con in Hale House on Monday noon. Last night Dr. Polyani deliv- ered the only public address of his visit, speaking in Hale House Lounge before the Philomathean Society on \Can World· Economy Be Restored?\ In discussing world economy, Dr . Others To Be Here Russell Sage will De represented by Lucienne Prosser, president of Student Government at the Troy institution, Angela Cavagnaro, president of the senior class, along with Barbara Stratton and Eliza- beth Kahnstamm. The Empire State broadcast will include addresses by Misses Wil- liams and Prosser, and John A. Ruskowski, '41, along with that by Kohlhofer. A discussion will fol- low, which will include informal remark£ by others of the delegates. They will be entertained through- out the rest of the day by mem- bers of the local committee at luncheon, dinner, and the annual Christmas Carol Sing in the eve- ning. One of the personnel men who is assisting in the work put the chief benefit of thl' interviews as \learning to talk to an older man without being jittc~y.'' He said that \there ien't mucn wrong with the boys. Placement is mostly a case of indefinable 'hunches' which are u::;ually right anyway.\ He explained that cer·tain individ- ual traits of personality or atti- tudes could often be pointed out to the prospect which would give him a better opportunity of mak- ing a good impression with future employers.

Polyani stated that it is the inter- national system under which we live. The international gold sys- tem presupposes the absence of war, he continued, and the fact that this system was able to op- erate was that during the 19th century there were no wars ex- cept the Franc-o-Prussian conflict. France was able to pay her debt to Prussia within six months after the war was over. This sy~;tem was an outcome of the way nations carried on trade, and no one was in control. main th01oughfare. When the food is being passed The list of courses is civiced into two classifications. The Hr~t group includes those in tended primuril;; to train men now une:-nplo:;ctl, Oi' employed in work not r:ow co.n~t>ct­ ed with the National Defense ?ro- gram. For instance, the cou:·se i.r \Elementary Electrical Theo1 ~· unu Practice\ is intended to give to persons not previously engaged in engineering work sufficient train- ing to enable them to be of service in the electrical industry in con- nection with manufacture opera- tion or testing. The course in \Drafting and Drafting Room Practice\ is another of the courses primarily directed toward training those now employed to qualify them for increased respon- sibility in industries associated with the National Defense prog1am. Courses in this group include \Tool The records are the first in a series of plays and poems by great authors interpreted by the best of contemporary actors and readers which are being acquired under the supervision of Cadman Hislop and Gordon A. Rust, of the English department for college instruction . It is believed that the recorded renditions of studied selections will give a greater meaning to these works to students who ~:eldom have an opportunity to hear profes- sionals. The recordings will supple- ment regular classroom discussion and reading. Dr. Polyani in this, his third visit to the United States, is Acting Lec- turer in Extension Courses for the Institute of Interna tiona! Educa- tion, which is sponsoring his tour. He hBs held the position of lecturer at the University of London and Ox,ford University in addition to teaching at People's College in Vienna.

George H. Mitchell, 8ecretary of the Retail Merchants Bureau of Schenectady Chamber of Com- merce, and Allan H. Rogers, super- intendent of ·public works of Gar- den CHy, Long Island, agreed that \most of the a.vaiJa:ble parking space lin ·business sections) is on costly street pavement intended primarily to ·fadlitate the move- ment of traffic, not for the storage of motor vehicles ... \ Garden CHy. which is n?puted to have model m·unicipally ownPd parking areas for which there is no charge in pa1·king, including over- night parlting for residents of ad- jacent apartment houses. was used by Mr. Rogers a>' an example of what municipalities can do to in- crease bU8ine8s for the merchant~. retain the value of property adja- cent to busine,;s districts. and fa- cilitate movement of traffic on the streets. Mr. Mitchell pointed out that \municipal parking will enhance rather than jeopardize the chances of small busine:;s to succeed. Re- tail business spends money in an effort to aHract shoppers to their town but whPn thE' shoppers come to town and find no place to par·k their car, the small rnPrchant is the victim of this gravP inconsistl?ncy.\ Private pa.rking areas, it was agreed, cannot make enough pmfit to provide facilities regularly, at- tractively, and continuously. Mr. Rogers advised that \for best results each ·parking area should be tailor-made to fit not only t·he needs of the particular community ·but also of thP imme- diate district served.\ At Garden City, he said, \after considerable study we came to the conclusion, in which many traffic authorities concur, that the provision of ade- quate off-street par· king arpas i,; a public responsibility. This conclu- sion was upheld by the courts .... Other interesting and new points of law confirmed in litigation ... in- cluded the right to assess the cost of acquisition ! of land for munici- pal parking areas) against benefit- ted property, and the right to ac- quire more land than was imme- diately needed, in order to plan for reasonable expansion.\ ----- -0---- Dr. Lewis Will Speak To Chemistry Club Tom arrow An invitation has been received by the Chemistry Club to attend a lecture Wednesday evening at the Ricketts Laboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

D. in 38 bly, ted of bly, s nd Junior Prom Committee Picked Z-511 Vol. LXIV., No. 23 Dr. Clowe Sa·ys N;o f·oundatiion To Epridem·ic Rumors Fox Urges That Illness Be Reported to Union Physician for Safety There is no danger of any sort of, an epidemic nor more than the regular amount of sickness on the campus, Dr. G. Marcellus Clowe, said yesterday. On Monday eve- ning the Delta Phi fraternity and on \v'~dnesday afteraoon the Kappa Nu house were quaranti-ned because of scarlet fever. UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N. Y., FRIDAY, DECEl\IBER 13, 1940 PRICE FIVE CENTS 'Skidmore Susie' Breaks Date Because o J Fever Skidmore Susie, the Union man's date, will be left to the wiley appeal of Dartmouth, Hamnton, Colgate, Williams and the rest because of a ruling by President Moore· of Sk-idmore that ao date with Union men be allowed the girls until after Christmas . The decision to bar the Dutch- meR from the Saratoga campus was made to protect the girls from any scarlet fever germs that might be carried up from this· campus. Scarlet fevPr is only spread by actual contact, Dr. Clowe said yesterday, and Skidmore health off-icials wish to avoid any possible contact with Union. This is the first time in Tthe Concordiensis' knowledge that · Union men have been kept from their s·kidmore dates. l:ln~ause of fraternity initiations on this campus tonight and tomorrow night few dates have been made \up north\ so the ban will not work havoc. Houghton Leads With Stanes~ka ln Gogol Comedy Eleven Get Lead Roles In 'Inspector General;' Alternates Named Donald Houghton, '43, has been awarded the leading part of the young official, Hlestekov, in the Union College Mountebanks winter . ·production, \The Inspector Gen- eral,\ while Miss Camil·le Staneska, broadway director and actress, has consented to take the female lead in addition to directing the play, it was announced- today by Gordun A. Rust, faculty advisor, following weekend tryouts which attracted 29 students and nine local women fol'' parts. Sunday Christmas Festival Includes Three Musical Programs;'Everyman'; Student Democracy Town Meeting Ruskowski Is New ·! --------- ______ ,, Student Discussion Meeting Chairman Plans for the four college confer- ence to be held Sunday, under the auspices of the Student Committee for Democracy, are going ahead on schedule despite the fact that two members of the Union Committee are undergoing a period of en- forced idleness in quarantine. Festival First Campus Christmas Celebration C h r is t mas celebrations at Union before the annual Music Festival was ;otarted, consisted of nothing more than a faculty children's party and the usual long recess, Dr. Charles N. Wal- dron, Secretary of the College reca-lled. The childt·en's party, which is still held at the Presi- dent's home, was an innovation of Dr. and Mt·s. Richmond and wa:s first held in Hanna Hall. Carol Sing To Be Held Simultaneously in Gym And Chapel at 7:30 Townspeople will join with the Unioa student body in observance of the annual Christmas Music Festival, when on Sunday a pro- gram of three mu.sical events and a presentation of a medieval moral- ity play will be presented in the Memm·ial Chapel and in the Gym. The Festival constitutes Union's Christmas services. Speaking in yesterday's chapel, Dr. Fox asked students who felt themselves ill in any way to com- municate at once with the college physicians whether they wished to be treated by them or not. Dr. Pox also asked students to \watch your- selves\ during the coming weelcs and months because of the influ- enza epidemic which is suppu~>Jd to Eweep the country this wintet\. T'wo Scarlet Fever Cases There were on;y two cases of scarlet fever, Dr. Clowe said, and both men had been removed to City Hospital. Their fraternity brothers are being quarantined to prevent the possible spread of the fever since it can only be caught by ac- tual contact with the person af- fected. McCandless To Be Junior Prom H,ead The play is unusual in the fact that 11 of the 19th pal'ts are al- most equally important. Other stars will be: J. Clarke Alberts, '44, the mayor; Samuel Portnoy, '42, Fil- lipovitieh, hospital commissioner; William Massee, '43, Lukitch, school superinendent; Jacob Van Aernam, '42, Lyapkin-Tyapkin, a judge; Harold Hendrickson, '42, Shepkin, the postmaster; Ellen Dewey, the mayor's wife; George Fawcett, '43, the police chief. Laskar Schwartz, '41, and Ar- mand Feigenbaum, '42, have both been prevented from attending the conference by illness in their fra- ternity. John A. Ruskowski, '41. will take Feigenbaum's place as student chairman of the discus- sions on the Empire State Tow.1 Meeting of the Air program. Student guests rep1·esenting Rus- sell Sage, Skidmore and RPI will meet at a reception before attenol- ing the Sunday chapel Christmas music service. Following Chapd they will be shown about the cam, pus and then taken to dinner in Hale House as guests of the Union Chapter of the Committee. An unusually long Christmas , recePs was given Union men in the 19th centmy. Often students would earn much of their tui- tion money by teaching a term of school during the two winter months, taking a week off be- fore and after the vacation. No Christmas celebrations of any sort marl{ed the week before the vacation started. The program for the day -inc! udes the regular Sunday Chapel services, the regular Sunday organ recital, and the annual Community Carol Sing. The chapel exercises will be broadcast over radio station WGY and the carol sing will be short- waved to Europe and South Amer- ica over WGEO and WGEA. The Sunday Chapel service will start as usual at 11 o'clock and w-ill be devoted to Christmas music by the choir, and by Dr. Tidmarsh at the organ. There will be no ser- mon. The broadcast portion of the program will start at 11:15. a.m. Dr. Clowe examined ·every one oick in bed and reported that there was the usual amount of grip but that there was no danger of it d<O- veloping into anything worse. Dean's office figures revealed that at least thirty have reported sick from the middle of last week and Dr. Clowe's office book showed that the medical staff had treated a large number of students ill with heavy colds. Gossip which has run rife around the campus concerning the number ill was blamed for the fear amor.g students. College authorities have branded as false reports that school was about to be closed. early. Stories that other houses were ready to be quarantined if another man falls sick was said to be with- out any sort of truth by Dr. Clowe. Sliidmore Worried Typical exampie of the way false rumors travel was the story that the Delta Upsilon house had been quarantined. Members of the house reported that Skidmore and Rus- sell 'Sage girls called to find out if the story was true. Yesterday the Skidmore health authorities telephoned to Herbert R. Houghton, Jr., college chaplain, and asked him to inform the stl)- dent body here that no Skidmore girl WO!lld !)e allowed to date a Union man until after Christmas because of the scarlet fever here. A talk with a Skidmore junior on the telephone revealed that garbled reports of the number s·ick at L'nion have been making the rounds of the Saratoga campus. ---o--- Additional Essay Rules Announced for Seniors Rules supplementing the infor- mation given in the college cata- logue about the Ingham and FrE>ling H.

Drawir g his example from the differences between the late Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill, the Carnegie visiting pro- fessor of intemational affairs ex- plained that because the present prime minister of England, Mr. Chut·chi!l, is a historian, he under- stands and accepts changes in world order. \The present era in England is one of anonymous resistence of .the masses,\ Count Sforza said. \Only two men deserve study. They are Churchill, whom everybody knows, and the next most powerful min- ister, Bevin, the labor leader.\ The lecturer pointed out that be- cause Churchill is an at·istocrat, the English will accept more easily the radical changes that are in store. A dictator himself, Churchill has not had the courage to say to \the upper classes that all dictators are alike.\ Bevin has had the courage to say that the privileged schools, such as Eton and Harrow, have not been such a success, the visit- ing professor continued. \He wrote but a few days ago that 'if the boys in the secondary schools can save us in the Spitfire, their brains can be turned to produce a new world.' \ The two comedy parts of Bob- chinsky and Dobchlnsky have been given to Stanley Green, '43, and Norman Fenster, '43, respectively. Smaller parts go to: Robert Dake, '43, Mishka, a servant; Martin Cap- lan, '44, a constable; Roger Allen, '43, Osip, Hlestekov's servant; Jos- eph Heaney, '42, a waiter; Miss Adele Fortin, a maid; Louis Loeb, '43, another constable; John Boyt, '43, merchant; Mrs. E. Jones, ser- geant's wife; Arthur Pastore, '44; Mary York, Leah Einstein, Mrs. Helene Zink, Wallace Morgan, '44, Harold Limpert, '44, Betty List, Durston Dodge, '44, officials·' wives, merchants, etc. Casting Not Final Mr. Rust anG Miss Staneska em- phasized that this casting is not necessarily final. \Changes and substitutions will be made as needed during rehearsals, on the basis of ineligibility, interference of personal plans, and inadequacy as indicated by rehearsals,\ they an- nounced. A!te1·nates have been appointed to each part and should be prepar- ed. Alternates in the order they will be called are: Fillipovitch, M. Caplan, '44, Alfred Swyer, '41; Lukitch, Robert Kempf, '44, A. Pas- tore, '44; Miska, Dodge, '44, Rich- ard MacKenzie, '44; the mayor, Caplan, Heaney; Lyapkin,Tyapkin, Heaney, Dodge; Shepkin, Robert Risley, Limpert; Bobchinsky and Dobchinsky, Smith and Caplan; contable, Dodge, Portnoy; police chief, Loeb, Kempf; mayor's wife, Roberta McWade; mayor's daugh- ter, Mary York, Betty List; Osip, Dodge, Mackenzie; waiter, Limp.- ert, George Lord; Hlestekov, Van Aernam, Heaney, Massee, '43, Limpert; maid, Mr~.

This statement was made in a telegram of condolence to the Brit- ish Embassy at Washington. Radio Worlrshop to Assist A rehearsal for the broadcast w~ll follow the luncheon at which time the speakers will be assisted by members of the Union College Ra· dio Workshop who have offered their services in making the tech- nical arrangements for the pro- gram. The Town Meeting Broadcast, from 3:15 to 3:45, will be conduct- ed in the round table manner. The topic of the discussion will be, \What Can College Students do for Democracy and National De- fense.\ After an introduction by Dr. Fox, the honorary chaihman, four speeches will be given, one by a member of each college commit- tee. The speaker· for R.P.I. will be Leonard B. Kohlhofer; for Russell Sage, Lucienne Prosser; for Skid- more, Muriel Williams, while Union's representative will be .John Ruskowski. The representatives from the va- rious colleges will explain what their particular school is doing to aid national defence and student democracy and all participants wHI join in a round table db;cussion . To Attend Community Sing Exclusive of the members speal{- ing on Town Meeting, each college will have three other representa- tives at the conference. From R.P.I. will come Robert H.

Besides a longer Christmas vacation, the Spring Recess also lasted much longer than the present recess. Christmas Party Planned For Dormitory Residents Invitations will shortly be dis- tributed for a dorm-neutral .Christ- mas party to be held in the Old Chapel on Thursday evening No- vember 19 at 8 o'clock. The party program, which is in charge of Professor Edward S. C. Smith, Proctor of North College, Mr. Gor- don Rust, Proctor of South College and Rev. Herbert R. Houghton, Jr., Proctor of Old Gym, is planned as a surprise. The 'invitations were described as \purposely misleading\ ·by Rev. Houghton -because the proctots wished to keep their .guests guess- ing and puzzled about the w'hole nature of the affair. Town neutrals and students wot'ldng for their rooms will also receive invitations. A Christmas wreath has been put up on the front door of Old Gym Hall. The residents of the second floor, North Section, South College are planning to decmate their hall again. In former years they have lined the hall with tinsel, put up a wreath and hung a \ME>rry Christ- mas\ sign from the ceiling. Worldly Friends Desert Everyman The telegram: \My only comfort on the death of my old friend Lord Lothian, is to feel he died figthing for the freedom and independence of England, of Italy and of Amer- ica. Please accept my deepest sym- pathy in your sorrow.\ The morality play \Everyman\ reaches dramatic pea-k during dress rehearsals as Five Wits (extreme right), Joseph A.

Play will be presen.ted at 6:30 in the Memorial Chapel and· in the gym. Dr. Tidmarsh will play a pro- gram of Christmas carols at his organ recital in the Memorial Chapel at 4 p.m. The choir will also assist in the pre::entation of this part of the day's program. At 7:30 p.m. Union will play host to friends of the college at carol sings in the Gym and in the Memorial Chapel. Slides with the words of the carols will be projected on large screens in the front of the chapel and the audience will join in singing of the carols. Gym Program Independent Unlik<' iast year, when the Me- morial Chapel sing was piped to the Old Chapel, the Gym sing will be independent of the Memorial Chapel program. Edmund Kelly, '41, student manager of the Glee Club will lead the singing in the Gym. A Hammond Electric organ has been loaned the college by Robert W. Baxter for uEe at the gymnasium evening service. There will be no reserved seats this year and the policy of first come, first served will be followed. An overflow crowd of more than 5,000 is expected on the campus but arrangements are expected to take care of the crowd adequately. During the community sings, a collection will be taken by the Stu- dent Committee for Democracy which will be given for British food, clothing and medical relief. The entire Memorial Chapel service is under the direction of a committee of the· Student Chris- tian Association and Dr. Tidmarsh. Assisting Lyall Dean, '43, chairman, are James Purdy, '43, Edward Fliegle, '42, and Edward Miller, '41. The Student Committee for De- mocracy is superv1smg arrange- ments for the Gymnasium carol sing while the Pyramid Club is furnishing the ushers.

After this week-end. the new members v.:ill be enabled to observe more of the inner workings of theit· chosen brother- hood, and, subsequently, to compare the standing of the fra- ternities at Union with what they may know of their posi- tion elsewhere in the United States. The men who, tonight o1· tomol'l'ow night, will be called \Brother\ for the first time, may notice, upon their fil·st ob- servation, that Union's fratemities opet·ate under certain handicaps. They wi.Jl have to learn the intricacies of a catch- as-catch-can rushing system. They will notice that the pro- portion of men pledged from each incoming class is not as high as elsewhere. They will be reminded that the proportion of their schoolmates who commute is high and find that, naturally enoug·h, many of these men have no interest in H fraternity. If they carry their investigations furthet·, however, they must surely notice that the Union chapters of the national organizations have escaped many pitfalls. They will find that those hysterical magazine articles which view the psycho- logical effects of selective rushing with alarm, or consider college fratemities as educational organizations with disdain, invat•iably base their strongest criticisms on points which do not apply at L' nion. Tonight's initiates will find few men at Union who want to join a fraternity, but who cannot find any congenial g-roup. They will find no single house so outstanding that those out- side it are socially ot· politically handicapped. They will find campus politics among the fratemities fat· Jess obnoxious than at other similar schools. In the frank belief, then, that each of those who are soon to be initiated is joining one of a group of organizations which represent a true credit to their school, we offer each one of them our heartiest congratulations.

The whole party and crew had only a crate of oranges and a dozen loaves of bread fat· the voyage because it was impossible to obtain food jn France. Upon their anival in England, the party was cla·pped into prison fo1 an hour because they had pre- sented Italian passports.

British officials at first had been dumbfounded when passports of a countt·y with which they were at war were presented with a claim of personal acquaintanceship with King George. Through n piece of extraordinary good luck they wet e able to get passage on the Dutchess of Atholl, the first ship leaving Britain for Canada after their anival. The Count had been able to change his money into Canadian Dollars and although he had lost everything realized that he was more fortun~ ate than the British subjects on the boat who could take with them butten pounds.

You know I'm not one to run on this way, but somehow everyone who set there sharing hymn-books with everyone else, and raising the roof with those carols, forgot all the things he spends half his time griping about. Guys get awful criti- cal at college-it gets so half the time you see a fellow on campus you think, \Oh that bastard.\ All that seemed wrong tonight, or rather, it was ignored. At any rate I feel pretty good right now-the best I've felt in weeks. I guess I'd thought you outgrow Christmas at college, or at least the kind of a Christmas· we have at home.

In 1907 when the Athletic Boa·rd put t-heir O.K. on the sport the stu- dent enthusiasts started off with a bang under Coach Bill Hardman, Playing such teams as R.P,I., Wil- liams, Hamilton, Colgate, St. Law- rence and Rochester, the team won 6 and lost 8. Under Coach Kuolt, the team of '10-'11 turned in one of the best seawns on record, win- ning 7 and lost 2. In '12-'13 the Dutchmen con- tinued their rise to basketball heights as Ernie Houghton, des- tined to become and All-American, and the Beaver twins joined the team. In the season of '12-'13 Union won the Northeastern League Championship whi-le winning 11 games after losing the opener to Rochester, 25-26. Later in the sea- son they gained adequate revenge to the tune of 23-21. Among its vic- tories that year were decisions over Colgate, Army, N. Y. U., Wil- liams and R.P.I. In '13-'14 the Dutchmen again hung up 11 wins but at the same time lost 3 games. The team of 1914-'15 captured the Northeastern League Cham- pionship again with a record of 11 victories and one loss, that to Cor- nell by an 18 to 24 count. Vic- tories were scored over Army, M.I.T., Princeton and two apiece over Williams, Colgate, R.P.I. and Wesleyan. The team was led by Captain Ernie Houghton and con- sister of the Beaver twins, Mudge and Woods, It was probably one of the best tn ever represent the , college. 1 The 1916-'17 team, while not hang~ ing up ar;~ impressive ·record, dicl win notable victories over Dart- mouth, Army, Princeton, Williams and Wesleyan. From 1919 co 1921 the Dutchmen went big time, playing nearly 20 games each ~eason, splitting 18 wins a•nd 18 losses in two season. The record whHe seemingly not too impressive, actually was as the Dutchmen played such teams as Columbia, Navy, N.Y.U., Syt·acuse, Carnegie Tech, Army, Delaware, Colgate, Cornell West Virginia, Brown, Princeton, Rochester, Yale, University of Detroit and one year the Un-iversity of Mexico. From then till 1924 these same teams were scheduled each year with the team hanging up an .500 average. Again in the 1924-'25 sea- son the Dutchmen rose to national fame with a record of 12 wins against 2 losse~ and the following season won 20 and lost 5. How- ever, the schedule makers had us back in our own class with St. Lawrence, N.Y.U., Hamilton,. Roch- ester, R.P.I., Williams, Wesleyan, and Amherst.

Recently, however, General Electric research scientists at Schenectady, :\'. Y ., outdid the Baron by ireezing light. In producing this frozen light, G-E scientists submerged fluorescent plates in a large ther- mos bottle of liquid air with a temperature of JlO degrees below zero. The bottle and the plates were then bombarded by x-rays, exciting the atoms of fluorescent material on the plates literally freezing them stiff. When the plates were removed and al- lowed to warm up, they glowed with all the colors of the rainbow. A\ bottle\ of frozen light was sent to East Orange, N.

It was his hope that young men going out into t·he world would face battle \not as a dog we :had, who turned over on his ·back and put his four feet into the air when he saw a bigger dog and thus escaped trou- ble\ nor would he want them to be nursed into a soft position like a dog \who always wanted his stom- ach scratched.\ Refuting t:he assertion ·by some students setting out to hunt for a job tha·t the cards are stacked ag.ainst them Dr. Johnson termed those who would wish to use myth- ical pull as in a \pathetic state of mind.\ Starting !rom· scratch was a handicap which made a start effec- tive Dr. Johnson said and it was the young man with the comfort- able start who had the cards stac!;:- ed against him. Resting against his start Wl:'S the fight he did not have for the chance he was seeking. Social Mobility he defined as a lack of old world class structures. If there were such structm es here and young men could not shift them, then there would be some justification for such a depression of mind. He warned against con- sidering uld world soc1al classes be- causee the war had made them ob- solete in Europe and they nevt>r existed in America. A long ovation followed his speech. As Dr. Johnson was about to acknowledge the applause and opened his mouth to speal{, the organ blaired forth with the reces- sional. Students wei e stunned for a moment because it looked as if the music was coming fwm Dr. Johnson's thr·oat-so well was it synchronized.

Both houses were quarantined earlier this week by scarlet fever. M·ore news came from the Delta Phis who have been forced to stay inside since Tuesday. The an- nouncement of quarantining was \taken pretty cheerfully by the house\ a member said and \sur- prisiNg little celebrating was done.\ fhere have ·been no beer parties at either of the houses despite the usual tradition of a \quarantine beer party.\ Amusement Forced i..musement ac both houses has been rather forced and has been limited to the I'adio, bridge, poker, reco1·ds and occa~ional study. The Delta Phis stocked up with Shiu Kong Yuen's large collection of records which he moved from North College ju~t before being quarantined, while the Kappa Nm laid in a large amount of rea:ding matter. Sleen until noon was re- ported from- t.he Delta Phi house. At the Kappa Nu house the cook has not been quarantined and the The Board of Health has pro- hibited the sending of mail from the Delta Phi house because the letters might cari•y germs. The Kappa Nus reported no such re- strictions. Contact with parents and the world outside the campus has been made via telephone in the Delta Phi case. Only excitement of the quaran- tine yet reported wae a fire in the Delta Phi house when a chair blazed np at 4 a.m. The origin was traced to a smolderiNg cig- arette. The fire, which destroyed the chair, was quickly put out with fire extinguishers, and the chair was th1•own into the backyard. A rug was also damaged. The Delta Phi d0g was included in the quarantine while the Kappa Nu~ were uncertain whether \Pak their Irish Setter, was included in their quarantine. General opinion of both The Concordiensis cor- resnondent was that the English 3logan, \Business as Usual,\ was applicable to them. ---(0---- Choir Sings at RPcital boys have set up a co-operative SCD to Take Collection For British During Sing Dr. ~idmarsit s afternoon organ system.

The courses carry f~d­ eral scholarships sponsored by the Federal Security Commission and administered by the United States Commissioner of' Education. Professor Russell A. Hall, direc- tor of the courses at Union, an- nounced this morning that 992 per- sons had applied for admission to the program when registration was closed at 10 P. M. last night. He roughly estimated that a:bout three- quarters of those registering were General Electric employees. At least 30 are women, mostly college graduates. Carolers Contribute $275 to British Relief The Christmas spirit mani- fested itself in a practical way on Sunday evening, when parti- cipants a:t the annual carol sing- ing program donated approxi- mately $275 to the Bl'itish War Relief Society, to be used for food, clothing and medical sup- plies. The collection, which was taken under the auspices of the Student Committee for Democ- racy has been deposited in a Schenectady bank and a check will be mailed later in the week to the Society. The S. C. D. took an active pazt in the festivities by arr ang- in.g the entire program for the Alumni Gymnasium. .Speakers from the Philoma thean society were present and one speech was broadcast in its entirety over the WGY shortwave sta- tions to South America. The Committee for Democ- racy, which had p! eviuusly plan- ned for a four college confer- ence to be held last Sunday, an- nounced through a spokesman, last night, that the conference would be held in its entirety fol- lowing the Christmas recess. 'Whole Truths' Education Need PRICE FIVE CENTS Houses Initiate 104 New Members During Weekend Delta Upsilon, Kappa Alpha Have Largest Number of Neophytes Sixteen fo~aternities intiated 104 men after a two day trial period ending with formal rituals Satur- day evening. Although two fzater- nities, Ka,ppa Nu and Delta Phi, did not hold their initiations be- cause of sickness in the houses, only four men fewer than were in- itiated last :year bound themselves to the various houses. Of the men pledged, only 25 de- ferred initiation. Delta Upsilon, with 12 men, and Kappa Alpha, with 11, initiated the largest num· ber of men. The initiates zepresent 48 per cent of the Class of 1944. The new members of the various fraternities are: Alpha Delta Phi: William C. Stone, East Moriches; Stanley A:yers Davis, Albany; Andrew Law- z·ence Comrey, Charleston, W. Va.; James Palmer Hawley, Bronxville, N. Y.; Robert Wadsworth Breiling Hastings-on-Hudson; Edward Cur- tis Akerly, Rochester; and Abram .<'ayette Molyneaux, Albany. Union College students must meet additional qualifications in that they are required to be good scholars~at least Dean's List standing-if they are to take the pilot training course and also en- gage in extra-curricular activities. Freshmen and those failing in courses are ineligible to enroll. Under the C. A. A. scholarship provisions, a student receives a minimum of 72 hours of ground school courses on the campus and between 35 and 50 hours of flight training at the Schenectady County Airport. Professor Thatcher has urged applicants for the C. A. A. scholar- ships to telephone him at the Union College Physics Laboratory for further information. The sixteenth annual Union Col- lege Christmas Music Festival be- came history late Sunday night as the last of the nearly 5000 guests filed out of the Alumni Gymnasium and the last bit of debris was cleared from the gymnasium floor. About 75 students, faculty and friends of the college had taken part in the presentation of the festival, which included three sep- m·ate programs of Christmas mu- sic. Nearly 100 students worked on the pre-program preparations. Dr. Fox's talk in both the chapel and the gymnasium was followed by short talks by William Birdsall and Edgar Fisher, respectively. The talks in Memorial Chapel were broadcast. The overflow audience, estimated by Ed Fitz at nearly 1300 persons, went to the carol sing in the gym- nasium, where Edmund G. Kelly, co-leader of the Glee Club, Jed the assemblage in traditional Christ- mas songs, accompanied on an electric organ by Charles L. Ried, Ed.ward W. Miller and Miss Helen Henshaw. Others of the late ar- rivals listened to the Public Ad- dress system from their cars park- ed in a triple line from Payne Gate to the Chapel. Many High School Graduates Men applying were predomin- ently high school graduates with qualifications to enter college as freshmmen. Three hundred were college graduates. Last night, Professor Hall and a staff of 12 instructors individual- ly interviewed 585 prospective en- trants. Saturday afternoon, 407 were interviewed. The total far surpassed the maximum estimate of 420 persons submitted to the federal government as a possible size for the program here. Pro- fessor Hall is in communication with Washington officials in an attempt to enlarge the course to include all those tentatively ac- cepted. Fenster Advocates Democracy's War Be Fought With Truth Seeking to \debunk the kind of debunking by debunkers\ Norman D. Fenster, '43, advocated in this morning's chapel that whole truths be used to fight democracy's war instead of half truths which have failed to shatter the stand of the cynical critic and short-sighted pa- triot. It was unforunate, he said, that the drift in education has been away from giving a truly objective picture of the situation, but instead \half truths\ have been u;;ed to present a rebuttle to other \half truths\ mouthed by those who would destroy democracy. To give a truly objective discussion of a topic, he believed that all view- points should bE' presentE>d with the greatest possible degree of ob- jectivity and that the student should be warned of any of the teacher's prejudices so that he may guard against being persuaded too easily \that way.\ Attention should be called to other sources dealing with the same subject. After that, Fenster said, the teacher has the right to give his own personal viewpoint, making sure, however, that he does so rea- sonably and not too emotionally emphasizing that it is for the in- dividual himself to make his deci- sions.

Studer will present the second in the annual series of popular Christmab lec- tures on Physics on Thursday. De- cember 26, at 2:30 p.m. T!le lecture will be held in the Physics labora- tory and wHl be on the topic of \Light and Color.\ This lect.ure will be the second in a series of popular physics dem- onstrations sponsored by the Col- lege Department of Physics. The subject of light, in which Professor Studer has been spe- cializing for some years, provides much material for demonstration experiments that are of visual in- terest, and for a discm:sion that is infor·mative without being too tech- nical in spite of the nature of the subject. In this lecture Professor Studer plans to illustrate the mor') gen- eral properties of light by exped- ments with white light, sodium light, and ultraviolet light. More technical characteristics of light will be exhibited with the help of the recently developed non-reflect- ing glass and of several experi- ments with polarized light. Th~ various ways of color p!'oduction- refraction, interference, diffraction, and scattering, will be illustrated. with special reference being given to the colors of the sunset and the soap bubble, the blue of the sky, the plumage of birds, and the col- (Continued on Page 4) The program had its official be- ginning at 11:00 a. m. when the morning worship service, devoted each year at this time entirely to Christmas music by the college choir, its organist-director, Dr. El- mer A. Tidmarsh and. the congre- gation, was attended by more than 1,000 persons. The program in- cluded an organ prelude, offertory and postlude by Dr. Tidmarsh, 12 Christmas songs by the choir and three hymns sung by the congrega- tion. The afternoon organ recital, which on this occasion included numbers by the choir, was attend- ed by some 1400 guests. Dr. Tid- marsh played: six organ solos and accompanied the choir in 10 num- bers. Simultaneous Carol Sings Seven different college organiza- tions assisted in the preparations for the program. The choir, under the direction of Dr. Tidmarsh, cli- maxed many weeks of preparation when they sang almost continu- ously from 9 to 12 Sunday morn- ing, from 4 to 5 Sunday afternoon, and from 7:30 to 1(} in the evening. The Trombone choir played at all three programs, the Mountebanks presented \Everyman\ to both evening audiences, the Student Committee for Democracy handled the arrangements for the Gymnas- ium program, the Pyramid Club provided ushers for the occasion, and the News Bureau printed en- velopes for the SOD's collection. The Christian Association had gen- eral charge of arrangements for the Chapel program and through its faculty adviser, Chaplain Her- bert R. Houghton co-ordinated the activities of the other groups engaged in the preparations. Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox supervised the decorations in the Chapel. Fox in General Charge The evening program, which con- sisted of two simultaneous com- munity carol sings in the Memorial .::!hapel and the Alumni Gymnas- ium. began in the Chapel at 6:45 with the presentation of the mor- ality play \Everyman\ by the Mountebanks. The Chapel was filled to capacity by 6:15, and the audience included a few deter- mined souls who had stayed after the end of the orga.n recital at 5 to assure themselves seats at the evening program. It was reported President Fox, who has general that the ushers, members of the charge of the Christmas Music Christian association and of the Festival, proved a constant source Phi Gamma Delta and Alpha Delta of information, for those engaged Phi fraternities, arrived just as in the preparatory efforts.

Tentath 1 e Plans Made Tentat·ive ,p;ans are now being made to hold the conference soon after the Christmas holidays In the meantime, members of the Union Student Committee !or De- mocracy, who .planned t.t.e confer- ence and who were to have been among ,the Union representatives present, have announced their in- tention o'f maintaining contact with the three neighboring schools to carry on by mail the discussion planned for Sunday's meeting. The announcement that the :Skid- more representa:tives would not be permitted to attend the conference ca,me as a natural aftermath of President Moore's request that Union men refrain from having Skidmore dates until after Christ- mas.

The game proved· a 11:1p-and-tuck affair until half way through the Iirst period, with the lead chang- ing hands eight times. Then with ten minutes remaining in the in- .tial frame, the Panthers found their eye and dropped in four two .iJGinters before the Dutchmen stemmed the tide. Middlebury led at half time 19 to 12, and Unior, never being able to take command of the game again in the last 2G minutes, trailed by at least seven· points for the remainder of the game. Ca.rnwright Impressive Whitey Carnwright, repaid Nitch- man for picking him for the start- ing lineup as the blond sophomore, p:aying his first varsity game, was the star of the conte~t for Union.

Fred Lapham of the Panthers was the indiv-idual high scorer with 12 points, follow- ed by his teammates Tom Neid- haJt and Will Ouimette, who tosoed in eight points·. Though Middlebury scored first on a charity toss by Neidhart, Union regained the lead on a field goal by Mickey Rathlev, and held tne lead on and off during the first ten minutes. Rathlev scored again at the four minute point to give the Dutchmen a 4 to· 1 lead.

Opp. New City Hall of Union College annouaced in New York City last weelr that the parent of one and the grandparent of the other of the two men who are doing most for the \hands across the seat tt'l Britain\ policy were union alumni, he revealed a fact nidden for years in alumni record riles because of the dropping of a ,niddle name. Proof that one Leonat·d Walter Jerome of the class of 1839 was the same Leonard Jerome wlil.ose daughter, Lady Randolph Church- ill, became the mother of England's prime minister, Winston Churchlll, was difficult to establish because of war· conditions but with. the aid of New York City librarians, Dr. Fox: establi;,hed the identity to Ms ::;a~­ isfaction only a few hour:; before addressing the New' York alumni ,ast week. HE' and Graduate Coun- cil officials had been working- for sPvera1 month~ on the problem. James Roosevelt, the father of l!'ranklin Delano, graduated from Union in 1847 but it is doubtful .vhether he ever met the grand- .athcr of a prime minister. The young Jerome WB..':l ·born at Pompey Hill in Onandaga County d.nd entered Princeton, then some- .imes called the College of New Jet·sey, whf'n he came of age. He ;tayed in Princeton only three ,·ears and, for an undeterm'ined rea- Jon then transferred to Un·ion. During that period, Union was .l.t the peak uf its fame under the ,.>residency of Eliphalet Nott. It ,,·aS', it is beliE>ved. the largest col- _ege then in existence. Since then, .-'rincpton trustees have permitted .he student body to expand while Jnion d.irectors have wished to ;eep the benefit>< of a small college.

Two docu- Seniors Complete Record Quizzes Examination Questions Stump Many Who Felt Secure in Knowledge Union seniors. had a chance to show off .their intellectual attain- ments y.esterday and today when they emptied their minds < ?J for thE' good of the Gradute Record Examinations and their immediate well being. The examinations which were given on the campus for the first time last year, are divided into two parts. The first part presup- poses the student to have had a great fund of general konwledge, requiring him to answer questions· on the physical sciences, humani- ties, biological sciences, social studies, verbal factors and mathe- matics. The second part was composed of questions on some specific sub- ject, usually the major of the stu- dent. Most of the students finished the examinations with the feeling that a few more years of college with some post graduate high school work wouldn't hurt any. Sample question: \who painted pink, pudgy nudes, Velasquez or Rembrandt or Reubt>ns. The ·boys took it all very seriously mindful of the words of wisdom offered by our institutional dean who some time ago stated that the scores of the examinations would bf' usE'd only to the students benefit and never to his detriment. opp. old armory open evenings 1Esqutrr :!mtn'n §qnp Haberdashery \as you like it\ 704 ALBANY ST.

When Jerome left Union, a grad- uate, in 1839, he dropped his middle name, Walter. This caused the con- fusion when a lacal historian in-· quired at the college whether he was the gt•andfather of Mr. Church- ill.

He did graduate worlt at Harvard, enter- ed the law and proved to be a very successsful business man. Although a close friend of Grover Cleveland, the elder Roosevelt never indulged in politics. Union also conferred an honorary degree on him in 1850.
