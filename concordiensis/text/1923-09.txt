It is fitting that an Otis Elevator should carry passengers up tkough the base to the· foot of the Statue.

Attendance at all home contests o.f Lnion teams is required of eyery student, but it is certain that the 254' freshmen who have reg- istere-d were not on the blachrs, and succssful cheering can hardly be accmnplished without numbers. Th.e fraternities are duty bound to 1 see that every man in their respective houses attends the game. I It should never come to the point where men have to be told to. gc> to the games. If they have so little interest as not to arouse the I necessary volition within themselves to go to the scene oi the con-, test, it is certain the college itslf has littl or no interest whetheT 1 those students remain a part of it. i :\tall CJ.ntcsts where spectators gather, l.:nion is put on display. 1 The stnclcnb {)!1 those occasions show the spirit which prevails here I largely hy their s:purtsmanship and by the calihre of their cheering. 1 The college Df today li\·es not wholly upon its lntrels, but upon what every student makes it.

Union .street. · Call and Get A Schedu:le Car.d ==========================~~=========================== MINO.R ACTIVITIES :\Iinor <Lctidties at Union are constantly being criticized hy the 1 sttlclents, who, from all appearances, seriously take considerable de-· light in passing \wise cracks\ about them. Vnfortunately Union is unlike tbe majority of other colleges in this respect. Football, basketball. haseba'll. track,-and there the Union man stops, for other things are for the \Veaklings to participate in and nnurish. Constant criticism ahout the college is all too prevalent 8nd is not without its ill effe.ct. For an example, let tts take the hand. There is probably no other! actidty on the campus which receives more criticism and less praise j than that one. Throughout last year and already on a good start j this y<.'ar, the leader of the hancl upon annou11cing the rehearsals at: the stuclen t meetings in chapel ·has heen snhj ectecl to considerable 1 1 azzing, totally unnecessary. The persons \\'ho st<Lrt the commotion· ,,·hich generally lasts several minutes, ancl those who take it up, are certainly lacking. l I It is easy for the man to go ott t on the foot'ball field amid cheers 1 1 , ;mel songs. for he kncw,:s everyone is watching him. But for the' man \dwse lot it falls to play in the hand, it is an entirely different story. He puts in his hours of practice in some clark and stuffy room. His opportunity comes to perform and he hides on the bal- I cony 11f the gymnasium and does his week qu.ite unnoticed. He . · doe~n't e\·en have a good place froH1 which to Yiew the game as do ~ the majmity llf the r1ther students. He may play a hand instrument: <1:3 \\\ell as the star performs on the field, but he is unnoticed. And it is without recognition that be plods on and on in his work, that the ~•pectators at the game might be treated with a few numbers during 1 he lulls in the contest. It takes a gnncl man to fight, e\·en with p1:aise being bestowed upon him. hut it takes a better man to keep up the battle amidst no, recog-nition ancl eYen criticism. . \ In student meeting when a man arises to talk, give him the, floor, for he has something to say, '\V'hich eve11 though it may not be: ' of interest to you, it may be to others. Many will say it is good na-1 turecl razzing and only fun, hut to one who puts his 1 hest into a thing 1 with a certain goal in view it is discouraging and to say the least im-1 polite.
