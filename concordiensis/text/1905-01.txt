Two of the banquets were given by the Alumni Asso- ciations of New York and Washington and· the one at Syracuse was held during the convention of the associated principals of the State. Each one was well attended and enthu- siastic. The oldest graduate present at any of the three meetings was of the class of '44· Younger al u1nni vvere out in force and every meeting was brimfn1 and running over with Union life and ambition for the college. Such meetings as these are usually passed over by the general undergradttate body with but little interest. And yet were these gatherings of ott\r alun1ni not to occur fron1 time to time, the best part of Union College would sink into oblivion. How· n1uch real pennanent good does the student body ever do for its college? If it don't do the college any harn1 and leaves _it to the graduates to work for their alma mater, the college breathes with fair assur- ance. And the graduates make the college what- ever it is. If they are loyal, generous and self-sacrificing, the college shows it, tnater- ially and otherwise .. If they are entirely absorbed in then1selves and forget the source of their education, the college suffers and gives evidence of it. Union has a nun1 ber of ahunni associa- tions in various parts of the country. Many more however, could find favorable loca- tions. There are at present the following: General Alumni Association, Alumni Asso- ciation of New York, Alumni Association of New England, Alumni Association of Al- bany and Northeastern New York, Alumni Association of W ashington,Altunni Associa- tion of Genesee Valley, Alu1nni Association of the South.

It is a duty, to per- form which he was given the privilege of ·working entirely for himself for four years under the patronage of an institution which for four years worked an;d lived for him. tion. 'T'1ti:s word in n1any many instances is a toreign -one in the vocabulary of the Union students. Students at Union don't seen1 to realize that the day of graduation just marks the beginning for better or for worse of H1eir partnership with their college. The four years before were but to serve and test their apprenticeships. BASKETBALL BEGINS-WH'Ei\'? Wpatever the Athietic Board says, the students generally accept as truth. So the college will have no basketball team (this was known some time ago) for the Board has said that such a tean1 wouldn't appear to the advantage of the college in its new clothes. Our Athletic Board is very cautious. False steps in the past have now made it quite fearful of stu1nbling, and it refuses to go ahead until it is sure of everything, even the result of the games. Its plan as given by Dr. Tovvne is a good one if the students design to give it their notice, perhaps the repairs on the gytnna- siun1 will work miracles in the student body and inspire it to refrain from taking its an- nual winter term nap. Class basketball teams cannot thrive on the suggestion of even the Athletic Board. If they do not wax strong or at least live along somehow until they die, the chances for the recognition of 'varsity basketball by the Board next year are about as great as for its recognition of \drop-the-handker- chief.\ REAL ENGI·N EERING. Pro£essor Landreth has tried to interpret the wishes o£ those who are wrapped up in engineeri11g subjects, and will h ring here several men who have had practical ex- perience in different branches of ~engineer­ ing to give the benefit: of their exp-erience to those who subsist on theory alone. ,. . It is a bsnrd to suppose that there will be a smail number of our B. E. and :E. E. men present at these lectures. 1'he subjects that -vvill be tal< en up are too tnuch a part of themsemves. Four of the speakers are Union graduates which will add interest to their lectures. The engineering divisions appe2ar mncl1 pleased to have the opportunity to hear out- side men talk on subjects dear to their own hea,rts, and are grateful to Prof.essor Lan- dreth for his efforts to provide interest .and instruction for them bevond th~ reqtnre- men.ts of the regular .courses.

I2 THE COl'lCORDIENSIS. ============================= ··--========== CIVI:L EN·GIN:EERING LECTURES Professor Olin H. Landrethe, the head ·of the civil engineering department has arranged for a series of lectures by- prominent young engineers on engineering subjects with which they have been. identified. Among them are: Charles Par- sons, chief engineer of the Hud.so11 River Water Power Co., on \Spi Falls Power Development;\ Justin Burns, Cornell '93, on \Engineering Ex- periences in China.;\ Isaac Harby, Union '95, with Roebling & Sons, on \Maki:ng of the Cables for the Williamsbueg Bridge;\ J. P. Whiskeman, Cornell '98, on \Steel Building Construction.\ Also August Kreusi, Union '99; J. 0. Reynolds, Union '94; Chas. E. Gregory, Union '94. The lectures will be held in the chapel and will be given with stereopticon views. Justin Burns, Cornell '92, who will give the :first lecture on \Engineering Experiences in China\ Monday night in the chapel, was for seve- ral years engaged in railroading in the middle western States. He went to China in 1902 for the .American China Development Co., and was first assistant engineer on the Canton-Hansow Rail- way. The other speakers w'ill come as follows: Jan. 27- Isaac Harby. Feb. 1 7-J. P. Whiskeman. Feb. 24-Charles Parsons. March 3-J. 0. Reynolds. March 31-A. Kruesi. April 14-C. E. Gregory. JUNIOR WEEK The junior class is backer of a sehe1ne which is entirely new at Union, the idea of a Junior Week. Except that that class started it, perhaps it is stretchi11g the matter slightly to call it a Junior week, as there will be but one distinctly 1906. evening. The week will be that of the Sophomore Soiree which is to be held on February 10. A Junior Hop will be held on Thursday evening, the day before the Soiree. The remainder of the program has not been settled definiately as yet. The facul- ty have granted F'riday of that week as a holiday and on that afternoon the Allison-Foote debate will be held or a lecture on Lincoln, whose birthday occurs two days later will be given. It :i:s very probable that Manager Stevens of the Musical Clubs will arrange a concert for Wednes- day evening. Manager Benedict of the Van Cur- ler, is reported to be willing to book some first class talent for one of the days in order that a theatre party may be one of the attractions. ':rhis latter, if held at all, will have to be Saturday afternoon. The pr.ograrn as outlined above will occupy the time from Wednesday evening until Saturday evening. During this time all the fraternities will hold house parties, entertaining in this way the guests from out of town. As was said before, this program is by no means definite and some changes will, in all probability, be made. For this :purpose a committee from the Junior class has been appointed and is working in conjunction with the Sophomore Soiree commit- tee. JOINT BIBLE STUDY INSTITUTE On January 14-15th four delegates from the Y. M. c. A. had the pleasure of attending a Bible Institute held at Hamilton College. This Institute is an organization conducted by Colgate and Hamilton to further the interest in Bible study at those two coBeges and discuss the best methods of accomplishing this end. Satur- day was spent in listening to addresses by pro- fessors from the two colleges and Sunday morn- ing Dr. Griggs of the Auburn Seminary, delivered a powerful address in the chapel. President Stry- ker, who takes great interest in this work gave several short talks at the meetings and explained how full the Bible is of the very knowledge col- lege men are looking for and that make our lives worth living. All the Union men were given a hearty reception by Hamilton and feel that such a meeting is of great value in furthering; the best Y. M. C. A. interest.

THE CO~VCORDIElvS!S. PHARMACY. At an extraordinary session of the State Board of Pharmacy over seventy applicants were exam- ined for license. From this college fifteen men tri,ed and twelve passed. Speaking of these examinations Professor Brad- ley said ''It has always been most pleasant to us that so many of our boys pass the Board exams at the first trial.\ He said in addition that while, including college men, only from 3 0 to 40 per cent. ,of all applicants are successful, from 80 to 90 per cent. of A. C. P. men are successful on the first trial. At a recent meeting of the class of '05 a com- mittee was appointed on commencement invita- tions. It is e:xpected that the topic cards for this term will be ;issued next week. The do€1egates who represented the association at the :B-ible Institute at Jiamilton, were Waldron '06, !{itt '06, Weier '06 and Mcintosh '07.

REVIEWS No novel reader who likes best those bv•)h·s which stimulate curiosity in the first page anll. then never suffer interest to lag for an instant un- til the last leaf is turned, should fail to read \l\tl~· Lady Laughter,\ the latest volume fro:rn the graphic pen of Dwight Tilton. In this story, a vivid, powerful and inten~el.{ human romance of a stirring period of Anwrican life, the author of \Miss Petticoats\ has rt'HurnAd to the fashion which made that widely-read novel · o11e of the most successful books of the year of its publication; for, as its captivating title 1::-!igni- fies, a woman is the chief figure in thls Jlew romance.

The period of the tale is of those months of the American Revolution when the town of Boston, restless under the yoke of the British, was in a state of siege The story progresses .swiftly before a background of such stirring scenes as those enacted at Lexington and Bunker Hill The lives of its fictional characters are closely interwoven with the deeds of Joseph Warren, Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, John Hancocl{ and George Wash- ington, all of whon1. stand forth from the novel- ist's canvass with striking vividness. The pic- turesque quality in which the novel abounds finds ample scope ir!- such scenes as Fanueil Hall used for British theatricals, the Liberty Tree, the rid- ing school in the South Church, the Hancoek Mansion and the Queen's ball at Province House. Yet despite all this wealth of fact and associa- tiQn, \My Lady Laughter\ is by no n1eans an his- toriea'l novel, in the general acceptance of that term.

The love romance of Constance Drake and John Brandon appeals because it is their story; the history and associa- tions are there because the novel's people hap- pened to live \in the days of the siege.\ It would be unkindness to the intending reader to deprive him of the enjoyment of the surprises of the en- grossing plot. Suffice it to say that \love is the 1naster\ and. that heroism and gallantry, audacity and wit, aTe its hand-maidens. Co.nstance Drake is an enigma, but an essen- tially feminine and always lovable one. Strongly dramatic and in its chief character irresistibly fascinating, it is easy to predict that \My Lady Laughter\ will speedily fincl the great success on the stage tha,t has greeted the story between cov- ers. The publishers, C. M. Clark Publishing Com- pany, Boston, have evidently come under the spell of \My Lady,\ for the artistic and tender treat-

The ten striking pictures painted by Charles II. Stephens are reproduced by a new and .artistic process in the original colo·rs. Its cover; too, fs a work of art, and with its faithful reproduction of the poster figure of ''My Lady Laughter\ is a revelation of book-making possibilities. In this and other respects this new Dwight Tilton romance is undoubtedly the most notable book of the winter. America's Foreign Policy.

THE CoNcORDIENSIS VOL. XXVIII. UNJOJ\T :CO'LLEGE, J.AN. 28, I904. No. I4 AMERICAN RAILROADS IN CHINA ;Cornell Engineer Tells Experiences. rrhe first of a series .of lectures u:nder the aus- pices of the Civil Engineering department was g· .. ven in tlbe 0~1.a.pel oa 1Vlm1da.y aifternoon 1 • 'The speaker was Mr. Justin Burns, Cornell '9 2, who has been intimately connected with the develop- ment of railroads in China and it was upon this subject that the lecturer spoke. The talk was profusely illustrated by a number of stereopticon pictures. Mr. Burns introduced his subject with a ge11eral statement concerning the extent, population, lan- guage and progress of China. It was not until the ·c:o>'le o.f the C'hina-Ja.panese war that Clh.ina tho·r- oughly realized that western ideas must penetrate the Celestial Empire if she wished to hold a place among the powers. In connection with this for- ward movement the idea of constructing rail- roads figured prominently. As a result, conces- sions were given to various nations allowing them to build railroads. To Russia was given the coun- try in the north of China, to Germany the north- eastern portion, to Great Britain the middle east, to France the southwest, to Belgium the middle north, and to the United States the middle south. Of the American concession, the most important route is that from Canton to Hankow, a distance of some seven hundred miles, with its branch division from Canton to Sam Shiu, a stretch of thirty miles. It was about this latter route that Mr. Burns spoke. Owing to the proximity of a waterway to the line of the proposed road, the engineers li-ved in house boats. When compelled to travel inland, they took up their abode in the village temples which did not seem to offend the priests in the least. In fact, these temples seem more like our town halls and can be rented at a non1inal price. The engineers received the direct aid of the Chi- nese officials in their efforts and the ~ower class did not seriously molest them at all, deeming the approval of the officials sufficient guarantee of good faith on the part of the foreigners. Each party was accompanied by soldiers which served the double purpose of protection and display, al- though excelling admirably well in the latter capacity. Upon the entrance to an important vil- iage, a forma.l call was paid the officials and when their sanction was obtained, the battle was half won. Considerable difficulty was experienced in mak- ing cuts, owing to a popular superstition toward the .gods of wind and water who, when offended, bring bad luck. Certain hills, trees, and ceme- teries are held in sacred a we and it was often dif- ficult and sometimes ]mpossible to prevail upon the Chinese to allow them to be touched. To obtain a clear title to right of way was far n1ore expensive than that of reconnaissance and location. The natives have a peculiar custom of designating their ownership of land by a monu- ment in the centre of the area possessed and not on the perim.eter as is our custom. The difficulties arising from such a system are apparent. After the American engineers had staked out the prop- erty, a Chinese surveyor would stretch a string around the boundaries of the plot and, using a wooden div,ider spaced to five Chinese feet, would :painfully step off this distance. He would then compute areas in as many hours as it took the Americans days, and strange as it may seem, al- ways checked with the American figures. In construction, the Chinese proved themselves worthy in embankment work, but failed in grasp- the requiren1:ents f01? bridge building. The exca.- vation work was done by coolies who used an in- strument resembling a hoe and often the common pickaxe. Women also, as well as men, were used ~ in this work, oftentimes carrying their children on their backs while hard at work. The earth,

'1. ! i i': 6 THE CONCORDIENSlS. consisting ·chiefly of clay, was cut in blocks and these were transported by passing from hand to hand or on sleds. When sufficient sand was :present to 1nake the· mass unstable, it was ·carded in baskets. Wheelbarrows were tried but \\v:i!t~out success. Owing to the cost of steel, concrete was used in bridge construction as much as possible, leaving only an opening wide enough for the jacks. to :pass. The short steel girders were transported on snan junks and lowered into place by the fall of the tide. Steel ties were used on the double track portion of the railway, and oak beams on the re- mainder. The passenger service is divided into three class- es as is the custom in many foreign countries. In the third class which seems to be the most :Pat- ronized, the coaches are simply flat cars into which the passengers are huddled. Although our ideaT of railway travel is not in a flat car drawn by a discarded Manhattan \L\ engine, the Chinese seem to enjoy thoroughly this recent innovation. -·---<- UNION IN THE MISSION FIELD Alumnus Writes From Arabia Mr. L.

THE S! MPLE. 'LI,F'E. An alun1nus of Cornell has written an ar- ticle for the Cornell Alumni News deploring the increase in the cost of student living at Cornell. He says that the average expendi- ture has beco1ne so much more in the last twenty years that those students stay away who would get the n1ost good from a college education and who would do the college the most good. This increased expenditure, and in some cases it may he called extravagance, has spread itself among all American institu- tions of higher learning. Bnt they tell us that education has been putting on frills which the student of twenty years ago thought were pedantic. Time has proven that some of these frills are neces- sary or at least helpful. Consequently the student pays for them like everything else. Most \ologies\ and \ics\ .cotne high even if their need is not always apparent, nor their worth satisfying when measured by the product of the rnint. Besides our \prac- tical\ learning has widened and lengthened in its scope, and also widened, lengthened and deepened in expense. No one feels that the progress of educa- tion is being checked, and the student today with less money in his pocket knows on graduation that he has had better chances for a better education than the ahuHnus of twenty years standing. One reason why \plain living and high thinking\ have fallen fron1 the pedestal of tnany college youths is because those old- titne tnottoes are losing their strength as ideals in the outside world. Dr. Bailey of Yale says that the students who spend the least stand the highest in the classes. This teaches a lesson. But it doesn't prove that the student to gain his n1 arks will do it by spending or saving 1noney. Grin1-visaged ornament-Skating rink.

THE CONCO'RDIENS/5. II ONLY THIS. AND NOT'HlNG MORE. A professor of logic at the University o± California is at work on a machine vvhich, he says, will eliminate all errors in the con- sideration of ·syllogistic propositions and show at a glance what conclusions n1ay be drawn fro1n a given pren1ise. Ask the ma- chine any question that can be represented by certain set forn1ulas used in logic and it win turn out the correct answer. Now, if he will give us a machine to inte- grate calculus problen1s, solve the tnysteries of things like stresses, explain so1ne expres- sions in psychology, incidentally translate a little Latin, take down physics lectures, go around to chapel and write a few essays now and then, some of us 1night rnanage to worry along.

Histories of former years at this period are also apt to be cheerless. The opportunity to go to Troy on a relay tean1 is tempting and unusual, so a number of tnen are responding. Union ought to be well represented for her best runners are out to 1nake a place. Con1petition cannot be too keen, Capt. Raymond says, so there are plenty of chances for more n1en. Will the other classes take up basketball as the freshn1en have done? That's another question which those who are interested hate to ask themselves. Dr. 'rowne is go- ing to arrange a schedule. That's all he can do. The fresh1nen have clone all they can do. Now what will happen? A ghastly drean1-Skating rink. tNTERCOLLEGIAT'E ORATORY. Union is just about due to win the orator- ical contest :fron1 Rochester and Syracuse. Three years ago we had th~t honor and we have had our share fron1 the beginning. But we rn ust not lose this year. Six or seven men at least ought to come out for the trials. It won't be fair to the college unless that number compete. It is a singular fact that when Union has won it has generally been when the hon1e trials presented the largest nu1nber of com- petitors. Monun1ental mockery-Skating rink.

The sentiment of the song is refined, and its music made with harmonic skill and due regard for vocal exigencies. \Golden Days,\ also by Rhys-Herbert, is a song of more robust facture, in the ballad style, and ends with a climax that should never fail of its effect if well delivered. The words are particularly well conceived and have been feHcitously translated into music.

PRESIDENT RA YM·OND IN THE S0 1 U!TH Tells the Students of His Visit to South Carolina College On Wednesday morning, Dec. 1.8, President Ray- mond gave an account h1 chapel of his recent visit to South Carolina. The occasion of his visit was the Centennial Celehration of South Carolina College and he bore the g.reetings of Union. Col- lege which stands in a peculiarly close relation to the southern institution. As President Raymond said: \In their infancy both colleges were rocked by the same hand and nurtured and cherished by the same loving heart The name of Jonathan Maxcy was their joint in- heritance.'' Jonathan Maxcy was the third president or Un- ion College and resigning because of ill health, he sought. a southern clime and became interested in the movement that led to the founding of South Carolina College. He became its first president and held office until his death in 1820. In presenting the greeting of Union College President Raymond took occasion to refer to the number of students from the South who have been educated at Union.
