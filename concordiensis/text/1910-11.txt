THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. 35 NOVEMBER S, 1910 NO.6 SATURDAY A BANNER DAY IN ATHLETlCS FOR UNION. 'Varsity Team Defeats Stevens by a Score of g to o-Sophs Defeat Edison Drafting S.chool, and Frosh Outplay Albany High and Albany · Academy-Cross-Country Team Victorious. The Garnet eleven played a fast game at Ho- boken on Saturday and brought the Stevens In- stitute players into camp to the tune of 9 to o. Every man on the team played well and showed great improvement over any of the previous gan1es. Captain Brown was ea.sily the star of the game. He n1ade Union's only touchdown and executed a neat field goal fron1 the forty-yard line. His kicking was said to have been the best seen on the Stevens gridiron for years, not a l)Unt going less than forty yards, and every one sailing high enough in the air to give the ends plenty of time to run them down and tackle the man in his tracks. Fairbairn ran the team wen and the ends both put up a fast game. Comstock did son1e great punting for the Stevens team, and Meyers at quarter showed that he was an old hand at directing the plays. The Union players showed a marked improve- ment in the use of the forward pass. Ned Riley was especially clever at receiving the pass, and this play was worked eight times for substantial ga1ns. Stevens won the toss and chose to defend their north goal with a hard wind at their backs. O'Connor kicked off to Crooks on the ten-yard line, who ran the ball back ten yards. Riley tackling him. Unable to gain through the Un- ion line, Co1nstock tried a forward pass, but \Btnnhle\ was on the spot and intercepted the hall. Touchdown Scored. Brown and Sarvey hit the line for first downs but on the next play Crooks caught an attempted forward pass. On the first play Crooks fun1bled and Sarvey covered it for the Garnet. A for- ward pass from Brown to Sarvey took the ball to Stevens' three-yard line. Sarvey netted two yards in a line plunge and then Brown carried the pigskin over for the :first score of the ·gam·e. Union punted out to Atkin on the fifteen-yard line and Brown kicked the goal. Score: Union, 6; Stevens, o. In the third period the Garnet carried the ball to within five yards of their opponents' line only to lose it on downs. lTntil a few minutes before the end of the ga1ne the ball see-sawed back ancl forth in the center of the field; then Fairbairu by a sensational fifty-yard run placed the oval on Stevens' forty-yard line and Brown executed one of the prettiest field goals ever seen on the Stevens field. Final score: Union, 9; Stevens; o. UNION. The line-up: STEVENS. Riley -------------- __________ ----------- Harris Left End. O'Connell, Branson ---------------------- Ford Left Tackle.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. SOPHOM·ORE FOOTBALL TEAM Defeats Edison Drafting School by Large Score. On Saturday the Sophomores won an easy game from the Edison Drafting School by the decisive score of 26 to o. The ball was kept near the opponents' goal during the greater part of the game, and the Sophs were able to gain at will. The line-up of the Sophon1ores was: Ends, J(albfleisch and Anderson; tackles, Mohair and Fischle; guards, Hallock and Ulrich; center, Boughton; quarterback, Clarke; halfbacks, Mc- Mahon and \iVilcox; fullback, Davis (captain). Sophs at Brown Station To-day. This afternoon the Sophomores are to play a game with the Brown's Station team of King- ston, a team composed 1nainly of ex-college players. The opposing team is a heavy one and v:ill make the 1913 men put up a good game if they win. · On November 8 is the annual Sophomore- Freshman gan1e. The Sophomores are to play Albany Acaden1y at Albany on the eleventh, and on the nineteenth they will line up against the Amsterdam High School. There is also a game pending with Chatham High School. FRESHMEN FOOTBALL. Albany High Defeated Io-o. Saturday afternoon the Freshman team played Albany High School in Albany, the result being a score of 10-o in favor of the Frosh. The Frosh line-up was as follows: Left end, Naumann; left tackle, Coons; left guard, Abbott; center, Tilly; right guard, Kreusie; right tackle, Gochinsbu; right end, Hickok; quarterback, Noble; left half- back, Jepson; right halfback, Anderson, full- back, Storey, Brown. Also Defeat Albany Academy Team. Monday, November I, the Frosh team again played in Albany, defeating Albany Academy by a score of 43-0. The Academy team was out- played in all respects, the ball being in their territory during the entire game. Touchdowns were made so often that it was hard to keep track of the score. UNION EASILY WINS FROM COLGATE IN CROSS .. COUNTRY Run With Vermont This Afternoon .. The Union runners easily defeated Colgate in the cross-country run held in Schenectady last Saturday, by the score of I I to 25. Captain Travis and Rogers. :held the lead during the en- tire course, the £ ormer being the first to reach the tape. The Colgate team was handicapped by the fact that Captain Carney and Bezant, two of their best men, were unable to make the trip. The order in which the runners came in was as follows: First, Travis, (U.); second, Rogers, (U.); third, La Barron, (U.); fourth, Legeler, (C.); fifth, Streever, CU.); sixth, Wheeler, (C.); seventh, Van Nos,trand, (C.) Pickard, one of the Colgate men, turned his ankle so badly that he was unable to finish. The time of the four miles was 2r mtn., 23 sec. High School Defeats Seconds. On Wednesday afternoon the Union second team was defeated in a three-mile run by the Schenectady High School, the score being 17 to 19. The Union team was composed of Tremper, Vedder, Braman a.nd Elmore. Staver, a high school freshman, nnished first, Tremper being second. The thne for the three miles was 15 n11n., 9 sec. Run With Vermont To-day. This afternoon the Garnet runners will meet the Vermont cross-country team, the run being held in this city.. Last year the run was held in Burlington, Union being defeated by one point. The Union runners, however, are in better condition than they were a year ago, and are prepared to render a good account of them- selves. The Vermont runners, who arrived in the city yesterday afternoon, are Donahue, Roberts, Ald- rich and i\.bbott. Donahue is the only runner who was on the Vermont team last year. He '\von third in the run at Burlington, being de- feated by Rogers and one of the Vermont men. The Union team will be composed of the satne nten who defeated Colgate. = G f< tl 11 p ( 1 1= I ]

The matter of securing a coach for the basket- ball team this year has not yet been definitely decided. At chapel meeting Monday a motion vvas made and unanin1.ously carried that fifty cents should be added to the athletic tax for the winter term and should be . collected with that tax at the Treasurer's office. This will make about $ISO available for se- curing an able coach. Manager Atkin has been able to do nothing definite in the matter as yet, hut has several good men in view.

The time made in the run with Col- gate last Saturday showed that our runners are unusually fast and are able to hold their own against teams· fron1 any of the colleges of U n- ion's size. This victory on Saturday is one of the few victories that we have won over Colgate in re- cent years, and the team has certainly shown themselves worthy of the support of the student body. Nevertheless, the Concordiensis is obliged to state that there was a lamentably poor show- ing of students to see the start or finish of the Colgate run. There was no football game on the campus that afternoon-nothing whatever to draw the students away from the run, and yet there ·were not enough students present to gtve even the faintest sort of a cheer when the run- nets came tn. Of course, a cross-country run 1s not as In- teresting to watch as a football game. But the runners are working just as hard for the in- terests of the college as the football players, and deserve as loyal support. To-day the team will have a hard meet with V ennont. If they win, it will be after a lo'ng, hard run, and they need your support. The run will sta,rt at 2:30 o'clock and will be over before the football game. Every- body should be present to see the finish, and greet the first Union runner that crosses the tape with a cheer that will show him that you appreciate vvhat he is doing for the college. THE HAMILTON GAME. The last football game of the season will be played on the Campus against Hamilton next Saturday. On this gatne, to a large extent, depends the suc- cess of the entire season. For many years Ham- ilton has been our keenest rival, especially in this fo,rm of athletics. No football season has he en cc.>nsicl:erecl a cotnplete success unless it re- sults in Hatnilton's defeat, and no season which has resulted in a victory over Hamil ton, even though we have lost the majority of the other games, has been considered a failure. Also, the impression which the last gatne r the season n1akes u~)on the c!ty people and th.., world at large, is apt to he the impression vv t< s· c s f t 1:: r: I- 1 t t 1

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 which they receive of the entire season. A vic- tory over Hamilton is certainly something worth striving for, and something which is not apt to come to us unless we do strive for it. The student body has little right to expect Captain Brown and Coach Regnier to turn out a team that will defeat Hamilton unless they receive better support than they ha-ve had during the past week. ill t is the duty of every fellow who has a suit to be out on the field during the com- ing week, for a good scrub is ab.solutely essential d ' . to a goo varstty. It is the duty of every other fellow to learn the songs \Vhich are being prepared for the Ham- ilton ga:me, and to attend the meetings when the song leader calls for a cheer and song practise. Last year we practically out-yelled Hamilton on their own gridiron. The Hamilton teatn is to be accon1panied by ·a large hody of student sup- porters this year, and unless we learn the songs and attend the rehearsals, we are running the risk of disgracing our team and the college by being equalled or surpassed in singing and yell- ing while on our own campus. MUSICAL COURSE ARRANGED. Several D·elightful Entertainments to Be Given This Winter. The com1nittee of ladies c'otnposed of Mrs. Riclunond, 1frs. Gibson, Mrs. Ashmore, Mrs. Ev- erett Smith and Miss Darling have prepared a n1usical course for the winter that will delight those who like good nntsic. At present there are three concerts schedu'led and it is hoped that the Fl onzaiey Quartette w111 be a];>le to make two visits, thu~ bringing the total number to four. These will, as was the case last year, be held in the college chapeL The first concert of the season will be held on January roth, \Vhen the Delmetschos will appear and will reproduce the music of the Olden Titne, .. perfonnecl upon the instrument for which it was written. They will also sing selections from the music of the Elizabethan period and will dress i_n the costume of that day. The Flonzaley Quartette, who were here last winter, will make their appearance on the third of February. So great was the demand for these people that it was possible to make hut .one engagement with thetn. The co1n1nittee is trying to get another date for May with them but the outlook is not bright. The third performance of the winter in which Madame Alma Gluck, the singer, ap- pears, will he held on some Friday night in March. The date is not. settled since Madame Gluck's engage1nents at the Metropolitan Opera House are Lot yet definitely scheduled. Regular subscription tickets are to be sold at the rate of four dollars each, but a special rate of two dollars will be given the students. The tickets will cover the season's programme. REPUBLICAN CLUB. The Union College Republican Club was re- organized last Friday as a member of the Na- tional Republican College League. Mr. Joseph :C. Sears, New York State me1nber of the na- tiona:l committee of the league, acted as chair- man. The officers are: Lloyd N. Rpbinson, president; Chatfield T. Bates, vice-president; Henry H. Kimberly, secretary. The object of the league is not only to assist in supporting the Republican party, but to stimu- late an interest in politics. Statistics sho·ws that ye:ung college alumni are especially delinquent in exercising the right of suffrage. This is partly cl.tte to the fact that they can not vote while at a college outside of their legal domicile. One of the planks in the platform of the league is to make it legal for men to vote while away at college. The club is open to those allied with the Re- pub 1ic1.n party and all who have not affiliated \vith any other party. ELE:CTRfiCAL L·ABORATORY.

The original plan of the Counci 1 1 was to have the members collect sums of money from their classes for Council expenses and college enter- pnses. In placing ·the financial w9rk of the Council on a bYoader basis, as was done at the last meeting, the field for this sort of college sup- port has been robbed of its pettiness, both from the side of those giving and th.ose collecting. Until this new plan is approved by the trustees, cur work tnttst go on in the ol;<i method, and v;hile the work of n1ost of the dasses given be- h>w is good, the fact that only fourteen out of C1e fifty classes represented on the Council have given anything, is not as satisfactory. r863--------- $roo.oo t886 _________ $75.00 1867--------- IOO.OO r887- -------- 10.00 1872--------- 35-00 t888_________ 32.00 1873------ --- 7 5.00 1881--------- 15.00 I 875 --------- 100.00 18')8 __ ------- 17.00 188r _________ r28.so 1899- _ _______ so.oo r88S---·------ t;o.oo 1901--------- 6.oo T n practice the new plan woald work out as fc•l1ow·s: ./\ ltnnni wou1 c! be a s.ke d to rnake a yc arly gift tn the college of such an amount as -vvoulcl not be burdenson1e.

Near i]arney, s WILLIAM H. SEWARD HONORED AT ALASKA-YUKON EXPOSITION Statue Unveiled in Me.mory of One cf Union's · Illustrious Sons. At the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, held at Seattle, \iVash., from June to Q:ctober last year, a day was set aside to honor the memory of Lincoln's great Secretary of State, William H. Seward, one .of 1Jnion College's .tnost dis~ tinguished alumni, and the man who was in ... ' strumental in effecting the purchase of Alaskq, from Ru.ssia. As is generally known, Seward was born in r8or. In r 816 he entered the sophomore clas$ of Union College and two years later was grad.- uated with high honors, being a Phi Beta Kappa man. For several years he practiced as a lawyer and then was drawn into the unsettled national political life of the period. Seward served as United States senator and during the Civil \Var was President Lincoln's Secretary of State. · Seward's Purchase of Alaska. After the war, during which relations between .the United States and Russia were t>specially friendly, t1egotiations were entered upon by Seward for ·the purchase of Rttssian North Atnerica. Seward recognized that under Amer- ican control this territory would beco1ne of great value to the nation and would give to the United States a foothold for cotnmercial and naval operations frotn the Pacific States, In the face of the most a clverse criticism ftorn press and public all over the country, Seward carried out his plans and in r868 an act making an appro- priation to pay for Alaska was finally passed. This territory has proved a profitable purchase; in a few years Alaska was paying annually into the national treasury n1ore than she had cost, and later discoveries of gold and silver helped to s'vell the enormous wealth she was pouring- forth. This was the act of a sagacious and far- \ s c c ( j

September the tenth was the day set for the ceremonies to commemorate Seward and his great services to the whole country and esp~­ cially to Pacific development and progress. The formal exercises were held at the New York State Building, a replica of the Seward home at Auburn, N. Y.. At r2:3o o'clock, Mr. Benjamin M. Wilcox, chief executive officer of the New York State Building, gave a luncheon to General William IL Sewar~, a son. of Secre- tary Seward and to William H. Seward, Jr., his grandson. A large nun1her of prominent men and Exposition officials wer·e present. At 2 :oo o'clock, the most important event of the clc..y, the unveiling .of the Seward statue, occurred: vdth appropriate ceremonies. This was held on the grounds of the building, with Ron. Thomas Burke presiding, and addresses were made by prominent men, among them Secretary Seward's son. In the. evening a banquet was given in the State Building at which Jt.tdge Burke also pre- Russian minister: \Let us rnake· the treaty to'- night.\ This beautifu~ statue -was utnveiled by the grand-daughter of ex-Govern.(}r McGraw, of the State of Wash.ington, in front of the ~ew York State Buildin-g, and stands as a permanent reminder of the greatness of the· m..an whom our ·whoie .country adtnires. and to whonn. lJnion Col- lege points with pride as one who h~ts brought honor and glory to his Alma Mater. sided. Funds Raised by Seattle. The first moven1.ent for the erection of a suit- able m.onutnent to Seward was instigated by an article to a Seattle newspaper, in which atten- tion was called to the fact that, as Seattle had been benefited so largely fron1 the expanding trade with Alaska, her citizens could well afford to honor the memory of the statesman who pur- chased that territory for the nation. The Seattle Chamber of Commerce responded at once and appointed a co1n1nittee to raise the $rs,ooo nec- e:ssary to secure the statue. The Statue Itself. The task of making the statue was awarded to Mr. Richard E. Brooks of New York, a sculptor of high rank. After an extensive study of the s'ubject, 1\'Ir. Brooks -completed the model and took it to Paris, where it was cast in ~ bronze. The people of the Pacific Northwest believe that Seward's greatest achievement was the purchase of Alaska. That belief was im- pressed upon ~h.e sculptor, wlio has portrayed the statesman at that important hour of his great career.

Root, Kultchar Fullback HOBART DEFEATS UNION IN A CLOSELY CONTESTED GAME Vis1.tors Score One Touchdown-Union Twice Lof,es the Ball Within a Few Yards of Goal Line. In one of the hardest fought battles seen on the campus in recent years, the Hobart eleven defeated the Garnet team by the score of s-o. l 'n ion p' aye d. well during the entire game, but was unable to propitiate the goddess of victory, while the weather conditions prevailing Satur- d.ay n1ade the contest anything but pleasant to the contestants. A slippery field precluded long n~ns and n:ade the handling of forward passes difficult. Car)tain Brown and Sarvey were the stars of the gan: e and n1ade n1ost of the gains for U niOi:. ::\ ed Riley was the chief man 1n a couple of sensational tackling stunts and wa• clever at regaining the ball on fumbles. Wood, tbe visiting quarterback, did the .stellar work for the Hobart tean1. He made their only touch- down. tTnion twice had the hall on the Hobart one-yard line, but was unable to carry it over. Hobart kicked off to Brown on the ten-yard line. He, aided by the, interference, carried the hall twenty yards up the field before he was stopped. lJnion gained eight yards in two downs and then \Bumble\ punted. \iV ood imn1ediately returned the kick to Fairbairn, who ran back five yards. After a couple of line plays, Union again resorted to punting. Again Hobart re- turned and then for the ren1ainder of the first two periods there was a punting duel between the two captains, Brown and Wood. Brown was slightly t~e better, averaging more than forty yards. The half ended with the hall on Hobart's forty--yard line. Hobart Scores. Both teams started the third period with a determination to win at .any cost. Playing at high tension, the ball was kept near the center of the field. Finally Wood, by an end run and assisted by his team-'mates carried the ball to Union's ten-yard line. In three plays Wood was pushed over for a touchdown. Van I ngen failed to kick the goal and the score was Hobart 5, Union o. Time was called with the ball in Un- ion's possession on the forty-yard line. The fourth period opened with Union's team fighting mad. Sarvey and Brown tore up the line for big gains and within five minutes after the opening of the period, Union had the ball on Hobart's one-yard line. Unablre to carry it over, Union gave up the ball. Hobart at once punted out of danger. Again Union carried the ball steadily forward toward the goal line. A fumble delayed them. Again they pushed on, but the ti111e was growing short. Captain Brown carried the ball to the four-yard line. Sarvey took the ball on an end ru11, only to fall a yard short of the goal. Before Vedder could again snap the ball back, the whistle had blown and i 1 : was Hobart's game. The fina~ score was 5 to o in favor of Hobart. In the second period Brown tried for a field goal fro1n the thirty- yard line, but the wind carried the hall a little to one side. The line-up of the game was: UNION (o). HOBART (S).

The tug-of-war was an event that attracted much interest and wasted tnuch strength.

VERMONT DEFEATED IN CROSS-COUNTRY RUN '\ Union Wins First, Third, Fourth and Fifth Places. The l_T nion cross-country tean1 ended a suc- cessful season last Saturday by defeating Ver- mont with the decisive score of I<) to Q. The satne course was used as in the run with Col- gate except that the beginning and ending was on the football field, the race being so tin1ecl that the finish occurred just before the con1- n1ence1nent of the Hobart gatne. Rogers crosse(l the line not n1any yards ahead of Donahue of Vennont, tnaking a very close race. The runners finished in the following order: First, Rogers, (U.); second, Donahue, (V.): third, Travis, (U.); fourth, Streever, CU.): fifth, .I :I '\, I 'I. I ' I. i I ,j :

The team has ntade a fine showing this year and it is hoped that enough men will turn ou,t next spring to furnish material for a successful track team in the intercollegiate meets. THE BASKETBALL SI'l'UATlON. With the end of the footbaU season, the in- terest of the student body now centers upon basketball. Last year's tean1, while it won con:t- paratively few games, held some of the fastest teams to stnall scores, and was without question the best tean1 that we have had since the sport was given recognition five years ago. This year the 1[)rospects for a. \real\ tea,m are very bright. Of last year's squad, Coward, Hequemburg, Fairbairn, Johnson, Brumm, West- cott and Micks are still in college. Sarvey, '14, is reputed to be a fast player, and other good basketball material is reported in the entering class. A number of experienced men in the Al- bany departments have already announced theit intention of trying for the team. The management is not prepared to give out this season's schedttle officially, but we under- stand that it is to be an unusually hard one. The season will open imn1edia~ely after the Christ- n1as holidays and the last game will be played early in March. A call for candidates may be issued next week, but the squad will not settle down to work until after the Thanksgiving vacation. SOPHOMORE FOOTBALL. The sophomore football team has cancelled the game with the Brown Station team, and will probably not play any more this season. Al- though short, the season has been a successful one. Out of three games the one with the Edison Drafting School was won by a decided score, and the other two were ties. Thus the soph- omores' goal line was not crossed during the season. The following men have been on the team: Davis (captain), McMahon, Wilcox, Clark, Anderson, Mohair, Ulrich, Hermann, Stern, Kalb- fleisch, Fischle, Cronin, and Royce. $3,335 SUBSCRIBED BY .CLAS,S ,OF' '1,3, AND '14. So,phs Average $27.80 an.d Frosh $25o98. Yesterday 1norning the tnembers of the fresh- tnen and sophomore classes were asked to sub- scribe for the fund for the erection of the new gy1nnas1um. Both classes responded well to the appeal presented by Prexy Richmond,. Lawrence Mead and Harold Baker. The work of the fresh- men vvas especially pleasing, since they hav;e · been on the \hill\ but a few weeks and have not yet had a chance to become as (teeply iln- bued with love for Union's old gra:y walls as the metnbers of the class of 1913. Final arrangements for presenting this move- t:nent to the underclassn1en were completed by the gymnasiutn committee at a special meeting yesterday afternoon. This year the :eommittee was successful in keeping the affair a secret and in insuring a good attendance at the chapel service. Last year plans were all completed for asking for subscriptions frotn the freshmen, but notice of the con1ing event was unfortunately printed in one of the city newspapers, and as a result the majority of the seats upstairs were unoccupied during the chapel service. Those who were not present at the meeting- yesterday will be seen personally and giv.en every chance to subscribe, in order that no one •tnay have chance to feel slighted. The total amount which has been subscribed to the \gym\ fund is now approximately $38ooo. The canvass by Potter and Mead of the class of 1909 was completed some time age,. and the raising of the funds is now being left in large 1neasure to the Graduate Council. SOPHOMORE SOIREE ON DECEMBER 8. The sophomore s.oiree committee are planning to give two dances this year. The first one will be held on Thursday night, December 8, at Yates's boat-house. The second one will be held during Junior Week. The soiree in December is being supported well, especially b:y the two upper classes, and promisP.s to be a very suc- cessful affair. ---- PR ~--== \POL. ~ r~ ( ' h · Fres·: = Tl ·'l'lH' ~l'e tll page an pl't'-1'(1:(1 :NHl so· pl'ize fi ('·0101' l he prol 0(' (\1lll ~nped tlle pr he (:'X] [ll'Ollli 11 .fpatur~ won<lt•, I \Yill P The nnsilm lllltllhE tllP 'Ill nug~hf: rnmpt gE>t ir lertiol hl' pr F'or C'O\.Pl' ~l'nio ~llwk ~0111P ln~ t lig-llt ]) HI fpo1 lH' l'P <'i<l!'I SPP!ll \nn· h~gp·,. ~I~ n n m n 11 <'f\ ('ll]'l' 1 :)n Ill !

THE GAME Union ends her football season TO-DAY. this afternoon. The season as a whole has not been as successful as the team and the student b.ocl.y hoped that it would be ' yet it can by no n1eans be called a failure. \\' e believe that our tea1n this year is the best one that has represented the college since the abol- ishm·ent of football in 1906, and that this will he clearly proved in the ga1ne this afternoon. The coach, the captain, and the entire team have certainly done treir best to insure a vic- tory over our old rival this afternoon, and if the Garnet again goes ·down to defeat before the Buff and :Slue, it will be the fault of the stu- drnts, not of any man on the team. For during the past w·eek the squad has been m.uch s1naller t!~ an it shonl d. have been when such an im- portant gan1e 1s to be played, there being n1any persons 1vho arc in pc:>ssession of suits who have coi1tinua1ly failed to s hovv up at practice.' It can do no good now, however, to la1nent that in which we ha\'e heen negligent in the past. If we have not supported the tean1 with the true Union spirit by going out for the scrnh, the least that we can do is to be present at the game at pron1ptly 3 :oo o'clock, prepared to do our best to yell and cheer the tean1 on to vic- tory. Everybody must try to do his best. Let us know the songs and sing then1 in a n1anner such ns will not only surpass our rivals, but also be ;: constant source of inspiration to the tean 1 • \iVatch the cheer and song leaders.

Also, keep your eye on the leaders while forming the block '-l~\ between halves, and e1fter the singing of Alma Mater, don't show your lack of spirit by break- ing from the line and rushing for the bleachers. for if the parade is to be effective the students should remain in line and march hack to the bleachers in order. To-clay is the great clay of the season. If the weather is favorable, the ·largest crowd of the season will be present. It is the duty of the stuclents to show the city people and our rivals from Han1ilton, what the true Union spirit really is. I

The Secretary has recently received a letter fron1 Mr. Hall, of the Syrian Protestant College of Beirut, Syria, in which he speaks of the pleasure he had in meeting a lTt1ion graduate in Cairo, Egypt. These two \grads'~ spent the evening together, recalling college days, and the value of such a meeting proved so real to Mr. Hall that he sent a request for the Concordien- sls. It serves as another proof of the value to the alttn1ni as well as to the college which grad- uate n1eetings are sure to bring. NOTES. r835.

The Garnet and the Buff and Blue met in. their annual footha11 game Saturday and, despite the fact that the Union team was clearly the ag- g;res·sor and played the better ball at a.H tim.es, the score was 0-0 Union. secured the ball across Hamilton's goal line and twice they were on the one-yard line, but each time they were unable to score. After the first period, HamHton knew exactly what play was coming ancl managed to stop a gr.eat pa.·rt of tnem. As Captain Br:own s~:id at cbap€1 meeting 1\!Ionday, \When we did get through, it was their fault and not ours .. , Under the circumstances Union played excellent ban. Fairbairn and Sarvey _were the stars for Union, whiie Harper did stellar work for the vj.sitors. Union kicked off to Hamilton and the Hamil- ton man was downed in his tracks. The Union line held twice .and then Hamilton pulited. Fair- bairn c2rried the ball ba-ck for ten y.ards and then Union ma:de first dow·n on scrimmages. For a few minut€s the ball see-sawed back and forth on Hamilton's twentv-yard line, never o-nce being within Ri ~;ht of the Union gcal. Then the Gar·net t·?Hm began to force back their adversaries and the quarter €nded with Union in possession ot the ba1l on Ha.:nilton.'s ten-ya.rd line an·d an the students wild for a tat.Ichdown. Dnring the intermission, however, the Buff and Blue pia yers had figured out a] the Union plays, as they llad used th·e same s:vstetn of signals last season and were familiar with them. Whe·n Union can1e back in the second period they were unable to gain through the line and :Cound several of tr.eir trick plays blocked or broken up. The bDll went to the visitors en downs a11d they punted nut of da·n,ger. During the reinainder of the half, the ball was constantly in the Hamilton territon·. but Union vvas not able t.o carry it across. Early in the thlr-d Pf7\riod, U·niou made a f0r- ward paa~ which McDerrnott fum bled. Vedder, however. fell on the ball on Hamilton's three- yar.d lin€. Union's first down. On a straight buck, Brown advance-d the ball a foot. Ffarper stood be-hind the goal line ealling out the Union plays t·o his teammates, as fast as F'airbairn gave I ! ; I 1 ( ~ ', i li

Hamilton attempted to punt, but it was blocked and Reil:ey got the ball on the fifteen yard lin.e. Two downs 1nade n0 material gain through the line and Hamilton got the ball on a fo.rvva.rd pa.s3 to M cBer . ..nott. They at once punted out of danger. During the entir€ fourth period, the ball wa- vered near the Hamilton thirty-yard line, Union being unable to make any consistent .gains. Fi- nally the Ha1nilton backs fumb:ed one of Brown's punts and the ball rolled aero~~ tne goal line. Riley an:d Branson fell on the hall for what looked Eke a touchdown. After a great deal of discus- sjon the referee gave the ball to Hamilton on their seven-yard line. Hamilton then carried the ball out of dang€r and ti'me was .called with the ball on the twenty-yard line. During the third period Brown made Rn onside ~\-; ck that was one of the prettiest ever seen here. R.iley was on th€ spot and gathered it in. The officials were for a time unaecided whether o-r not to give Union the ball, the gain or both or neither. Finally after twenty minut€s of dis- cussion, they compromised by giving Union the ball but not a:Iowing the gain. It was during this period a.lEo that Brown tried- for a field goal, but the ball went to one side of the p.osts. The Line-Up. The lin.e-uv of the gaJ.ne was: U~IO~. HAMILTON. Left End.

Several Things Demonstrated by Results of the Season. The football season of 1910 h.as been an un- usually interesting and successful one from every standpoint except that of comparative scores. The result of the se.ason has dem·onstrated several things. First, that the ·final score -of a gam~e does not necessarily indic-ate the better team. Of the four games lost, only in the Williams game was the Garnet eleven outcla~~sed. In the contests with 'Roc-hester, W~esleyan, and Hobart, the Union team s·howed marked superiority in nearly every department of the game, yet were unable to obtain the necess·ary p-oints. ·for· a vic- tory although twice crossing the Rochester line, only to be brought back 'bY the officials; and twice being inside Hobart's one-yard line when the timekeeper's; whistle undoubtedly prevented the scoring ·of a touchd.own. Coaching System Efficient. 'In the second place·, the season has proved the efficiency of the Br·own system of coaching as ex- emplified by A. E. Regnier, Brown's· All-Amer- ican end of 1909. The fundamental ide.a of the Brown system :is light and snappy work,, con- serving the nerv.ous energy of the players, .avoid- ing injuries and overtraining, and it is partic- ularly adapted to the E•mall c-ollege where there is usually a lack of football m-aterial. 'Mr. Regnier 'has proved h·imself a master of every phase of the game, 'has won the confidence and esteem of studentr:'l, faculty, and alumni, and has turned out the !best dr,illed and ·most ag- gressive team that Union has had in years. In the game with Stevens the team played like a well-oilecl machine, and not once did the Hoboken team come within Union's thirty-yard line . The result of the Hamilton game which closed the football season was a great disap·pointment to Union. The 'Garne-t team was first choice from comparative E•cores and was expected to win. Al- though Union completely ·outplayed ·Hamilton, = ki tE C{ 0~ h E Sl 0 a p b i1 a f 1l t fj g }: I l t

THE CONCORI)IENSIS. 7 keeping the ball almost constantly -in the latter's territory, the necessary tottchdown w.as not .forth~ coming and an o .. o score was the final result. Only once did the Buff .and Blue team threaten the home team's goal line, w.lrilt} on the other hand Brown's ·dro·;p kick in the sec0nd period failed of scoring by a narrow marg·in. Union had the ·ball on 1 Hamilton's three-yarct lin€ ·oRly to lose H on a fum'bled forward pass, and a~ain in the last period Riley and McDm·m.ott together downed the ball back of the visi to1·s' goal line, only to have it brought back b-ecause the ball ha·d ~heen kicked along the ground in aUe·m.pting to recover a fumbled punt. Finally, the season has shown that while the new rules have apparently eliminated much of the danger of f.atal .accidents, there is S·till suf- ficient hazard to satisfy the· rnost strenuous. The game is easier on the playerE\· from the stand- po:nt of physical exhaustion. The spectators can more easily foll'ow the progress of the ball, but until ~.orne method is adopted for -infocrming the spectators ()f the reasons f0r the numerous pen- alties imposed, diss-ati~·faction with the work of the officials w.ill continue. The rules are too many in number, and are so diff.icult .of interpretation that even the experts will argue at length over disputed :points. ·Material for the team h·as been slightly more plentiful than usual and under Coach Regn.:er's skillful handling an O·rganiz.ation has been de- veloped which was far superior to the average of Union's teams. The line me·n have been partic- ularly strong both on offense and defense and have consistently withsto·od the onslaughts of the opponents. The 1 backs. have been fast and ag- gressive, an-d have been strong on end runs and skin tackle plays. In the kicking game Captain Brown has more than held his own against all opponent~'~. 'The chief weakness o·f tlle team ha~· been in handling forward p.asses and in choice {)f plays at critical parts of the game. S. A. M. BASKETBALL PROSPECTUS. ~ N.ow that the football season is over, bnsketball tqkes its place in the UmeUght of CoQllegiate life. Every afternoon for the :past week there has been a squad of a bout tw<:m.ty new men trying cnt for the team under the direction of Captain Micks and Coach Kuolt. Practic€ is now being held in the college gymnasi11m, as the question of securing the armory for pra..ctice an1 home games has not been settled yet, although a fin.al deci- :si on i.s expected in a few days. The prospects are fair fo·r a ~ood team this :\ear to meet the stiff schedule arranged for it by Manager Atkin, who has succ€eded in securing gqmes with t-eams from institutions larger than we have played in recent years .. Amon,g the varsity basketball :players who will t,0 with us this yea.r are: Brum.n, :B,airbairn, Coward, Hequ·em bourg and Mic1rs. B:RlEFS. Many ()f the men on the Mus·ic Clubs will miss their Thanksgiving dinner at home this year, ow- h'l~ to their concert schedule wh1ch will keep them on the road from Tuesday till Satui'day next. Henry Ki.mberly will be the guest of his roOin- nl8.te, Don. Hutchens, at Pulaski, for the Thanks- giving r€cess. --------- CONICERNING HOCKEY. The prospects for a hockey team are, as usual, rnther slim. There S€ems, however, to be an abundance of mate:·ial in college to make a fast tea1n, if a suitable rink can be .se.eure·d. Several freshmen were ()n fast prep. school tea..:.ns last year and have i·ntimat·2 ~ their desire to \start scm.ething\ in the hockey line this winter. Chal- len?;es have been received fron1 several colleges, but the guarantee3 that they demand prohibit in- t~rcollegiate contests until the srort is on a firmer footing than at prese·nt. The City Leagu€, howeV·2r, ·offers an opportunity fer some good games and the only thing needed is r.. handy rink. Last year the men were com- pelled to journey to the Boat Club rin\k across the river, and as a result the available material i·n college was not brought out as it would have been had the ice been nearer. If a ·Corner oQf the campus could be flooded, or so~ne rink nearby found, there is no reason why Union should not te represented by a worthy hockey tean1.

AN AN N ClUNC E- MENT. With the ftr.st i-ssue a.fter Uwe Thanksgiving vacation the Concordiensts wiU start a series of arbicJes that should be of i:nterest not only to the ahtmni but to aU of the stlid€nts a.s welL In the :eJla;pel are the portraits ·Of twelve persons who were deeply interested in Union Colleg-e and are close- 1~ conne,cted with 14e:r- history. W'ithout doubt nearly every student at some time during his ,col- lege course, letting his .mind wander fron the chapel servic·a, ha:s dreamily gazed upon tbe por- traits that adorn tbe 1nilcony l=tn:d wondered what the hi3tory- of the p€rsons represented Inight be. For the enlightenlil:lent of such persons Ells series of articles ,is being plan~ned. Beginning with the picture of nr. Jackson on the left hand side looking fro.11 the pulpit, the victures win be taken UJ:J in order. The 1najorar of the articles will be written by rn:embers of t.he faculty or so1ne other person who is· in po.saec:;sion of infor- mation ~that Ehou~<l make an interesting story. The Concordiensis is Klso able to obtain erHs of the most pr,ominent persons represented which will appe,ar with th-e article. This will b·2 :pra .. ctically a new department for the Coneordien.sis but one which should make the raper of added inter€s.t and vah1e. Every student and alunun:.s is, or should be, interested in the \Velfare or his eo11eg€, and is doing everything within h1is power to jnsure her future success.. A knowledge of what otbe1· men.. prominent in Union's history have been able to accOIDl)jsh should be an ex:::tJnple and an incentive to those who are now loyal'!:v striving for the same end. BASKETBALL. With the close of the football Eeason, the interest :in athletics is now centered m~inly 4n basket hall. The foot8all team has been the best that 1J..ag represented ihe college for several ye,ars, and th .. ere is every reason to be- lieve that if we agail] obtain the armory in which to pract.ice and play the games, the ba.sB:etball tea. ... n win be the fastest in the history of that S 1 10rt at Unlon College, We have as coach this year, Mr. Kuolt, former- ly captain ·of the Ha.!.:nHton team. Mr. Kuolt thor- oughly understands i·ntercollegiate basketba11, and while in college W8s one of the best players in t~.e state.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 previous years. the coa.ch has beon1 a person who ba e had Ro experience i·Th intercollegiat~ basltet- ball. There has never bean n1ore <~r better material in college. There has never been. better .support among the students as was -eVidenced by the readiness with which the. steul€nts responded to tlJe appeal for financial he1p. The prospects are hd ght frorr1 every standpoint, and the t>asn:efban management has every right to look fo1·ward to the com:ing season with hopes raised high. Of course, we ca.n hardly expect to win every game of the season as we are to take the eourt against some of the strongest college teams, but we can expect that our tea.n will hal·d its own against tean1s f.rom any colleges of Union's size. THE PRESS CLUB CALEND,A.R FOR 19'11 AN AT'TRACT·IVE ONE To Contaiin Many New Views. The Press Club is producing a calendar for 1911 which is, without a doubt, the finest ever seen on 1.he campu~. It ifl to consist of thirte~n pages and a loose picture. Each month has a separate sheet which contains, be-sides a very handy calen· d::.r, views of. interest around. the ca ... npus and is 1)rinted tn gar·net and black. These views are with two exceptions entirely new, having been taken especially for the occasion. They inc1ude: The 1910 Me .. mori:.:tl Gat~ re.Ql::l c· ing the Blue Gate, President Riclln1ond's house, .Si1liman Hall, South College, North Colleg-e,-NorLh Colonnade, Lover's Lane, Library Lane, 1he Idol ::tfld th~ Cla8s Day Exerci·ses under the Kott Elm in Jackson's, Gardens. The background ia the en· graving of a piece of birch 1~ark with a portion cf the- center peeled back to show the lJicture. The entire is enclosed in an artistic cover. In- cluded is a fine photograph of President Rich- lnond which may l1e framed or used for some sirn- i::::.r purpose.

It i.3 b..op~-d that the sale will be extensive not only iL order to lu.elp the Press Club but· also to help the. college by having such a ·calendar around the country. ·----- TiH.E I·DOL EXPOSED. One- o\f the Concordy reporters' has finally lifted the mystic v-eil which has enshrouded Ulil.ion's r..e\v pub:ica.tion, \The Idol,'' for so 1oug a time. Dy much gum·shoeing and the taking of oaths of secrecy we have secured mea.gre .htformation con- cerning this infant period1eal.

Auburn will 2lways be asGociated in tbe minds of Union me·n as the home of \V. H. Seward. We 1nay rightly feel that the college will be remew- bered in that city with great kindness. Maybe few of us reaHze that Auburn has become a r€al rity and thus pres€nts a fie~d from. which we can nwst naturally draw students. This i.s the case with J.nany other places and the alumni, by in- quiring, will often find past events whieh serve as a meBns {)f presenting U·nion to the boys of their locality. Another case of this sort is found in Buffalo, \Vhere the largest High School in the city i.s named after a past mayor, Joseph G. Masten, who graduated from Union in the class of 1828. Our past has given us much to be proud of and to help us in the future. It remains for us to nse tr. is history and if we do, many of i\l!e good wishes we hold for the co[ege will materialize. It is tL.ne that the alumni waked to tbe work the High Schoe.J. A luncheon will als·o be given to wlu:i.ch WiU b-e invite·d the school officials.
